                                   How to Use the CFA
                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.
       The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam
       registration
    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the
x                                                    How to Use the CFA Program Curriculum


    knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use
    the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
    later review.
        Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
    exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
    and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




    ERRATA
    The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
    reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
    errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
    updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
    (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
    error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
    reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

            1           INTRODUCTION
                        Financial analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions,
                        including those related to buying and selling assets. Generally, the decisions involve
                        trading securities, currencies, contracts, commodities, and real assets such as real
                        estate. Consider several examples:
                            ■   Fixed income analysts evaluate issuer credit-worthiness and macroeconomic
                                prospects to determine which bonds and notes to buy or sell to preserve
                                capital while obtaining a fair rate of return.
                            ■   Stock analysts study corporate values to determine which stocks to buy or
                                sell to maximize the value of their stock portfolios.
                            ■   Corporate treasurers analyze exchange rates, interest rates, and credit con-
                                ditions to determine which currencies to trade and which notes to buy or
                                sell to have funds available in a needed currency.
                            ■   Risk managers work for producers or users of commodities to calculate how
                                many commodity futures contracts to buy or sell to manage inventory risks.
                            Financial analysts must understand the characteristics of the markets in which
                        their decisions will be executed. This reading, by examining those markets from the
                        analyst’s perspective, provides that understanding.
                            This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the functions of the
                        financial system. Section 3 introduces assets that investors, information-motivated
                        traders, and risk managers use to advance their financial objectives and presents ways
                        practitioners classify these assets into markets. These assets include such financial
                        instruments as securities, currencies, and some contracts; certain commodities;
                        and real assets. Financial analysts must know the distinctive characteristics of these
                        trading assets.
                            Section 4 is an overview of financial intermediaries (entities that facilitate the
                        functioning of the financial system). Section 5 discusses the positions that can be
                        obtained while trading assets. You will learn about the benefits and risks of long and
                        short positions, how these positions can be financed, and how the financing affects
                        their risks. Section 6 discusses how market participants order trades and how mar-
                        kets process those orders. These processes must be understood to achieve trading
                        objectives while controlling transaction costs.
                            Section 7 focuses on describing primary markets. Section 8 describes the struc-
                        tures of secondary markets in securities. Sections 9 and 10 close the reading with
                        discussions of the characteristics of a well-functioning financial system and of how
                        regulation helps make financial markets function better. A summary reviews the
                        reading’s major ideas and points, and practice problems conclude.




            2           THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM

                                      explain the main functions of the financial system

                        The financial system includes markets and various financial intermediaries that help
                        transfer financial assets, real assets, and financial risks in various forms from one entity
                        to another, from one place to another, and from one point in time to another. These
                        transfers take place whenever someone exchanges one asset or financial contract for
                        another. The assets and contracts that people (people act on behalf of themselves,

companies, charities, governments, etc., so the term “people” has a broad definition
in this reading) trade include notes, bonds, stocks, exchange-traded funds, currencies,
forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, swap contracts, and certain
commodities. When the buyer and seller voluntarily arrange their trades, as is usually
the case, the buyer and the seller both expect to be better off.
    People use the financial system for six main purposes:
   1. to save money for the future;
   2. to borrow money for current use;
   3. to raise equity capital;
   4. to manage risks;
   5. to exchange assets for immediate and future deliveries; and
   6. to trade on information.
   The main functions of the financial system are to facilitate:
   1. the achievement of the purposes for which people use the financial system;
   2. the discovery of the rates of return that equate aggregate savings with aggre-
      gate borrowings; and
   3. the allocation of capital to the best uses.
    These functions are extremely important to economic welfare. In a well-functioning
financial system, transaction costs are low, analysts can value savings and investments,
and scarce capital resources are used well.
    Sections 2.1 through 2.3 expand on these three functions. The six subsections of
Section 2.1 cover the six main purposes for which people use the financial system and
how the financial system facilitates the achievement of those purposes. Sections 2.2 and
2.3 discuss determining rates of return and capital allocation efficiency, respectively.


Helping People Achieve Their Purposes in Using the Financial
System
People often arrange transactions to achieve more than one purpose when using the
financial system. For example, an investor who buys the stock of an oil producer may
do so to move her wealth from the present to the future, to hedge the risk that she
will have to pay more for energy in the future, and to exploit insightful research that
she conducted that suggests the company’s stock is undervalued in the marketplace.
If the investment proves to be successful, she will have saved money for the future,
managed her energy risk exposure, and obtained a return on her research.
    The separate discussions of each of the six main uses of the financial system by
people will help you better identify the reasons why people trade. Your ability to iden-
tify the various uses of the financial system will help you avoid confusion that often
leads to poor financial decisions. The financial intermediaries that are mentioned in
these discussions are explained further in Section 4.

Saving
People often have money that they choose not to spend now and that they want
available in the future. For example, workers who save for their retirements need
to move some of their current earnings into the future. When they retire, they will
use their savings to replace the wages that they will no longer be earning. Similarly,
companies save money from their sales revenue so that they can pay vendors when
their bills come due, repay debt, or acquire assets (for example, other companies or
machinery) in the future.

                            To move money from the present to the future, savers buy notes, certificates of
                        deposit, bonds, stocks, mutual funds, or real assets such as real estate. These alter-
                        natives generally provide a better expected rate of return than simply storing money.
                        Savers then sell these assets in the future to fund their future expenditures. When
                        savers commit money to earn a financial return, they commonly are called investors.
                        They invest when they purchase assets, and they divest when they sell them.
                            Investors require a fair rate of return while their money is invested. The required
                        fair rate of return compensates them for the use of their money and for the risk that
                        they may lose money if the investment fails or if inflation reduces the real value of
                        their investments.
                            The financial system facilitates savings when institutions create investment vehicles,
                        such as bank deposits, notes, stocks, and mutual funds, that investors can acquire and
                        sell without paying substantial transaction costs. When these instruments are fairly
                        priced and easy to trade, investors will use them to save more.

                        Borrowing
                        People, companies, and governments often want to spend money now that they do
                        not have. They can obtain money to fund projects that they wish to undertake now by
                        borrowing it. Companies can also obtain funds by selling ownership or equity interests
                        (covered in Section 2.1.3). Banks and other investors provide those requiring funds
                        with money because they expect to be repaid with interest or because they expect to
                        be compensated with future disbursements, such as dividends and capital gains, as
                        the ownership interest appreciates in value.
                            People may borrow to pay for such items as vacations, homes, cars, or education.
                        They generally borrow through mortgages and personal loans, or by using credit cards.
                        People typically repay these loans with money they earn later.
                            Companies often require money to fund current operations or to engage in new
                        capital projects. They may borrow the needed funds in a variety of ways, such as
                        arranging a loan or a line of credit with a bank, or selling fixed income securities to
                        investors. Companies typically repay their borrowing with income generated in the
                        future. In addition to borrowing, companies may raise funds by selling ownership
                        interests.
                            Governments may borrow money to pay salaries and other expenses, to fund
                        projects, to provide welfare benefits to their citizens and residents, and to subsidize
                        various activities. Governments borrow by selling bills, notes, or bonds. Governments
                        repay their debt using future revenues from taxes and in some instances from the
                        projects funded by these debts.
                            Borrowers can borrow from lenders only if the lenders believe that they will be
                        repaid. If the lenders believe, however, that repayment in full with interest may not
                        occur, they will demand higher rates of interest to cover their expected losses and
                        to compensate them for the discomfit they experience wondering whether they will
                        lose their money. To lower the costs of borrowing, borrowers often pledge assets as
                        collateral for their loans. The assets pledged as collateral often include those that will
                        be purchased by the proceeds of the loan. If the borrowers do not repay their loans,
                        the lenders can sell the collateral and use the proceeds to settle the loans.
                            Lenders often will not loan to borrowers who intend to invest in risky projects,
                        especially if the borrowers cannot pledge other collateral. Investors may still be willing
                        to supply capital for these risky projects if they believe that the projects will likely
                        produce valuable future cash flows. Rather than lending money, however, they will
                        contribute capital in exchange for equity in the projects.
                            The financial system facilitates borrowing. Lenders aggregate from savers the funds
                        that borrowers require. Borrowers must convince lenders that they can repay their
                        loans, and that, in the event they cannot, lenders can recover most of the funds lent.
                        Credit bureaus, credit rating agencies, and governments promote borrowing; credit

bureaus and credit rating agencies do so by collecting and disseminating information
that lenders need to analyze credit prospects and governments do so by establishing
bankruptcy codes and courts that define and enforce the rights of borrowers and
lenders. When the transaction costs of loans (i.e., the costs of arranging, monitoring,
and collecting them) are low, borrowers can borrow more to fund current expenditures
with credible promises to return the money in the future.

Raising Equity Capital
Companies often raise money for projects by selling (issuing) ownership interests (e.g.,
corporate common stock or partnership interests). Although these equity instruments
legally represent ownership in companies rather than loans to the companies, selling
equity to raise capital is simply another mechanism for moving money from the future
to the present. When shareholders or partners contribute capital to a company, the
company obtains money in the present in exchange for equity instruments that will
be entitled to distributions in the future. Although the repayment of the money is
not scheduled as it would be for loans, equity instruments also represent potential
claims on money in the future.
    The financial system facilitates raising equity capital. Investment banks help com-
panies issue equities, analysts value the securities that companies sell, and regulatory
reporting requirements and accounting standards attempt to ensure the production of
meaningful financial disclosures. The financial system helps promote capital formation
by producing the financial information needed to determine fair prices for equity.
Liquid markets help companies raise capital. In these markets, shareholders can easily
divest their equities as desired. When investors can easily value and trade equities,
they are more willing to fund reasonable projects that companies wish to undertake.

EXAMPLE 1

   Financing Capital Projects

   1. As a chief financial officer (CFO) of a large industrial firm, you need to raise
      cash within a few months to pay for a project to expand existing and acquire
      new manufacturing facilities. What are the primary options available to you?

   Solution:
      Your primary options are to borrow the funds or to raise the funds by selling
      ownership interests. If the company borrows the funds, you may have the
      company pledge some or all of the project as collateral to reduce the cost of
      borrowing.


Managing Risks
Many people, companies, and governments face financial risks that concern them.
These risks include default risk and the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange
rates, raw material prices, and sale prices, among many other risks. These risks are
often managed by trading contracts that serve as hedges for the risks.
    For example, a farmer and a food processor both face risks related to the price of
grain. The farmer fears that prices will be lower than expected when his grain is ready
for sale whereas the food processor fears that prices will be higher than expected when
she has to buy grain in the future. They both can eliminate their exposures to these
risks if they enter into a binding forward contract for the farmer to sell a specified
8   Learning Module 1                                                         Market Organization and Structure


                        quantity of grain to the food processor at a future date at a mutually agreed upon
                        price. By entering into a forward contract that sets the future trade price, they both
                        eliminate their exposure to changing grain prices.
                            In general, hedgers trade to offset or insure against risks that concern them. In
                        addition to forward contracts, they may use futures contracts, option contracts, or
                        insurance contracts to transfer risk to other entities more willing to bear the risks
                        (these contracts will be covered in Section 3.4). Often the hedger and the other entity
                        face exactly the opposite risks, so the transfer makes both more secure, as in the grain
                        example.
                            The financial system facilitates risk management when liquid markets exist in which
                        risk managers can trade instruments that are correlated (or inversely correlated) with
                        the risks that concern them without incurring substantial transaction costs. Investment
                        banks, exchanges, and insurance companies devote substantial resources to designing
                        such contracts and to ensuring that they will trade in liquid markets. When such
                        markets exist, people are better able to manage the risks that they face and often are
                        more willing to undertake risky activities that they expect will be profitable.

                        Exchanging Assets for Immediate Delivery (Spot Market Trading)
                        People and companies often trade one asset for another that they rate more highly or,
                        equivalently, that is more useful to them. They may trade one currency for another
                        currency, or money for a needed commodity or right. Following are some examples
                        that illustrate these trades:
                           ■   Volkswagen pays its German workers in euros, but the company receives
                               dollars when it sells cars in the United States. To convert money from dol-
                               lars to euros, Volkswagen trades in the foreign exchange markets.
                           ■   A Mexican investor who is worried about the prospects for peso inflation
                               or a potential devaluation of the peso may buy gold in the spot gold mar-
                               ket. (This transaction may hedge against the risk of devaluation of the peso
                               because the value of gold may increase with inflation.)
                           ■   A plastic producer must buy carbon credits to emit carbon dioxide when
                               burning fuel to comply with environmental regulations. The carbon credit
                               is a legal right that the producer must have to engage in activities that emit
                               carbon dioxide.
                            In each of these cases, the trades are considered spot market trades because
                        the instruments trade for immediate delivery. The financial system facilitates these
                        exchanges when liquid spot markets exist in which people can arrange and settle
                        trades without substantial transaction costs.

                        Information-Motivated Trading
                        Information-motivated traders trade to profit from information that they believe
                        allows them to predict future prices. Like all other traders, they hope to buy at low
                        prices and sell at higher prices. Unlike pure investors, however, they expect to earn
                        a return on their information in addition to the normal return expected for bearing
                        risk through time.
                            Active investment managers are information-motivated traders who collect and
                        analyze information to identify securities, contracts, and other assets that their
                        analyses indicate are under- or overvalued. They then buy those that they consider
                        undervalued and sell those that they consider overvalued. If successful, they obtain a
                        greater return than the unconditional return that would be expected for bearing the
                        risk in their positions. The return that they expect to obtain is a conditional return
                        earned on the basis of the information in their analyses. Practitioners often call this
                        process active portfolio management.
The Functions of the Financial System                                                       9


    Note that the distinction between pure investors and information-motivated
traders depends on their motives for trading and not on the risks that they take or
their expected holding periods. Investors trade to move wealth from the present to
the future whereas information-motivated traders trade to profit from superior infor-
mation about future values. When trading to move wealth forward, the time period
may be short or long. For example, a bank treasurer may only need to move money
overnight and might use money market instruments trading in an interbank funds
market to accomplish that. A pension fund, however, may need to move money 30
years forward and might do that by using shares trading in a stock market. Both are
investors although their expected holding periods and the risks in the instruments
that they trade are vastly different.
    In contrast, information-motivated traders trade because their information-based
analyses suggest to them that prices of various instruments will increase or decrease
in the future at a rate faster than others without their information or analytical models
would expect. After establishing their positions, they hope that prices will change
quickly in their favor so that they can close their positions, realize their profits, and
redeploy their capital. These price changes may occur almost instantaneously, or they
may take years to occur if information about the mispricing is difficult to obtain or
understand.
    The two categories of traders are not mutually exclusive. Investors also are often
information-motivated traders. Many investors who want to move wealth forward
through time collect and analyze information to select securities that will allow them
to obtain conditional returns that are greater than the unconditional returns expected
for securities in their asset classes. If they have rational reasons to expect that their
efforts will indeed produce superior returns, they are information-motivated traders.
If they consistently fail to produce such returns, their efforts will be futile, and they
would have been better off simply buying and holding well-diversified portfolios.

EXAMPLE 2

   Investing versus Information-Motivated Trading

   1. The head of a large labor union with a pension fund asks you, a pension con-
      sultant, to distinguish between investing and information-motivated trad-
      ing. You are expected to provide an explanation that addresses the financial
      problems that she faces. How would you respond?

   Solution:
      The object of investing for the pension fund is to move the union’s pension
      assets from the present to the future when they will be needed to pay the
      union’s retired pensioners. The pension fund managers will typically do
      this by buying stocks, bonds, and perhaps other assets. The pension fund
      managers expect to receive a fair rate of return on the pension fund’s assets
      without paying excessive transaction costs and management fees. The return
      should compensate the fund for the risks that it bears and for the time that
      other people are using the fund’s money.
      The object of information-motivated trading is to earn a return in excess of
      the fair rate of return. Information-motivated traders analyze information
      that they collect with the hope that their analyses will allow them to predict
      better than others where prices will be in the future. They then buy assets
      that they think will produce excess returns and sell those that they think
      will underperform. Active investment managers are information-motivated
      traders.
10   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                               The characteristic that most distinguishes investors from information-moti-
                               vated traders is the return that they expect. Although both types of traders
                               hope to obtain extraordinary returns, investors rationally expect to receive
                               only fair returns during the periods of their investments. In contrast, infor-
                               mation-motivated traders expect to make returns in excess of required fair
                               rates of return. Of course, not all investing or information-motivated trading
                               is successful (in other words, the actual returns may not equal or exceed the
                               expected returns).

                             The financial system facilitates information-motivated trading when liquid mar-
                         kets allow active managers to trade without significant transaction costs. Accounting
                         standards and reporting requirements that produce meaningful financial disclosures
                         reduce the costs of being well informed, but do not necessarily help informed traders
                         profit because they often compete with each other. The most profitable well-informed
                         traders are often those that have the most unique insights into future values.

                         Summary
                         People use the financial system for many purposes, the most important of which are
                         saving, borrowing, raising equity capital, managing risk, exchanging assets in spot
                         markets, and information-motivated trading. The financial system best facilitates these
                         uses when people can trade instruments that interest them in liquid markets, when
                         institutions provide financial services at low cost, when information about assets and
                         about credit risks is readily available, and when regulation helps ensure that everyone
                         faithfully honors their contracts.


                         Determining Rates of Return
                         Saving, borrowing, and selling equity are all means of moving money through time.
                         Savers move money from the present to the future whereas borrowers and equity
                         issuers move money from the future to the present.
                             Because time machines do not exist, money can travel forward in time only if an
                         equal amount of money is travelling in the other direction. This equality always occurs
                         because borrowers and equity sellers create the securities in which savers invest. For
                         example, the bond sold by a company that needs to move money from the future to
                         the present is the same bond bought by a saver who needs to move money from the
                         present to the future.
                             The aggregate amount of money that savers will move from the present to the future
                         is related to the expected rate of return on their investments. If the expected return
                         is high, they will forgo current consumption and move more money to the future.
                         Similarly, the aggregate amount of money that borrowers and equity sellers will move
                         from the future to the present depends on the costs of borrowing funds or of giving
                         up ownership. These costs can be expressed as the rate of return that borrowers and
                         equity sellers are expected to deliver in exchange for obtaining current funds. It is the
                         same rate that savers expect to receive when delivering current funds. If this rate is
                         low, borrowers and equity sellers will want to move more money to the present from
                         the future. In other words, they will want to raise more funds.
                             Because the total money saved must equal the total money borrowed and received
                         in exchange for equity, the expected rate of return depends on the aggregate supply
                         of funds through savings and the aggregate demand for funds. If the rate is too high,
                         savers will want to move more money to the future than borrowers and equity issuers
                         will want to move to the present. The expected rate will have to be lower to discourage
                         the savers and to encourage the borrowers and equity issuers. Conversely, if the rate
                         is too low, savers will want to move less money forward than borrowers and equity
                         issuers will want to move to the present. The expected rate will have to be higher to

encourage the savers and to discourage the borrowers and equity issuers. Between
rates too high and too low, an expected rate of return exists, in theory, in which the
aggregate supply of funds for investing (supply of funds saved) and the aggregate
demand for funds through borrowing and equity issuing are equal.
     Economists call this rate the equilibrium interest rate. It is the price for moving
money through time. Determining this rate is one of the most important functions of
the financial system. The equilibrium interest rate is the only interest rate that would
exist if all securities were equally risky, had equal terms, and were equally liquid. In
fact, the required rates of return for securities vary by their risk characteristics, terms,
and liquidity. For a given issuer, investors generally require higher rates of return for
equity than for debt, for long-term securities than for short-term securities, and for
illiquid securities than for liquid ones. Financial analysts recognize that all required
rates of return depend on a common equilibrium interest rate plus adjustments for risk.

EXAMPLE 3

   Interest Rates

   1. For a presentation to private wealth clients by your firm’s chief economist,
      you are asked to prepare the audience by explaining the most fundamental
      facts concerning the role of interest rates in the economy. You agree. What
      main points should you try to convey?

   Solution:
      Savers have money now that they will want to use in the future. Borrowers
      want to use money now that they do not have, but they expect that they will
      have money in the future. Borrowers are loaned money by savers and prom-
      ise to repay it in the future.
      The interest rate is the return that lenders, the savers, expect to receive from
      borrowers for allowing borrowers to use the savers’ money. The interest rate
      is the price of using money.
      Interest rates depend on the total amount of money that people want to bor-
      row and the total amount of money that people are willing to lend. Interest
      rates are high when, in aggregate, people value having money now substan-
      tially more than they value having money in the future. In contrast, if many
      people with money want to use it in the future and few people presently
      need more money than they have, interest rates will be low.



Capital Allocation Efficiency
Primary capital markets (primary markets) are the markets in which companies and
governments raise capital (funds). Companies may raise funds by borrowing money
or by issuing equity. Governments may raise funds by borrowing money.
    Economies are said to be allocationally efficient when their financial systems
allocate capital (funds) to those uses that are most productive. Although companies
may be interested in getting funding for many potential projects, not all projects
are worth funding. One of the most important functions of the financial system is
to ensure that only the best projects obtain scarce capital funds; the funds available
from savers should be allocated to the most productive uses.
    In market-based economies, savers determine, directly or indirectly, which proj-
ects obtain capital. Savers determine capital allocations directly by choosing which
securities they will invest in. Savers determine capital allocations indirectly by giving
12   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                         funds to financial intermediaries that then invest the funds. Because investors fear
                         the loss of their money, they will lend at lower interest rates to borrowers with the
                         best credit prospects or the best collateral, and they will lend at higher rates to other
                         borrowers with less secure prospects. Similarly, they will buy only those equities that
                         they believe have the best prospects relative to their prices and risks.
                             To avoid losses, investors carefully study the prospects of the various investment
                         opportunities available to them. The decisions that they make tend to be well informed,
                         which helps ensure that capital is allocated efficiently. The fear of losses by investors
                         and by those raising funds to invest in projects ensures that only the best projects
                         tend to be funded. The process works best when investors are well informed about
                         the prospects of the various projects.
                             In general, investors will fund an equity project if they expect that the value of
                         the project is greater than its cost, and they will not fund projects otherwise. If the
                         investor expectations are accurate, only projects that should be undertaken will be
                         funded and all such projects will be funded. Accurate market information thus leads
                         to efficient capital allocation.

                         EXAMPLE 4

                            Primary Market Capital Allocation

                            1. How can poor information about the value of a project result in poor capital
                               allocation decisions?

                            Solution:
                               Projects should be undertaken only if their value is greater than their cost.
                               If investors have poor information and overestimate the value of a project in
                               which its true value is less than its cost, a wealth-diminishing project may be
                               undertaken. Alternatively, if investors have poor information and underes-
                               timate the value of a project in which its true value is greater than its cost, a
                               wealth-enhancing project may not be undertaken.

                         People, companies, and governments use many different assets and contracts to fur-
                         ther their financial goals and to manage their risks. The most common assets include
                         financial assets (such as bank deposits, certificates of deposit, loans, mortgages, cor-
                         porate and government bonds and notes, common and preferred stocks, real estate
                         investment trusts, master limited partnership interests, pooled investment products,
                         and exchange-traded funds), currencies, certain commodities (such as gold and oil),
                         and real assets (such as real estate). The most common contracts are option, futures,
                         forward, swap, and insurance contracts. People, companies, and governments use these
                         assets and contracts to raise funds, to invest, to profit from information-motivated
                         trading, to hedge risks, and/or to transfer money from one form to another.

Classifications of Assets and Markets
Practitioners often classify assets and the markets in which they trade by various
common characteristics to facilitate communications with their clients, with each
other, and with regulators.
    The most actively traded assets are securities, currencies, contracts, and commod-
ities. In addition, real assets are traded. Securities generally include debt instruments,
equities, and shares in pooled investment vehicles. Currencies are monies issued by
national monetary authorities. Contracts are agreements to exchange securities, cur-
rencies, commodities or other contracts in the future. Commodities include precious
metals, energy products, industrial metals, and agricultural products. Real assets are
tangible properties such as real estate, airplanes, or machinery. Securities, currencies,
and contracts are classified as financial assets whereas commodities and real assets
are classified as physical assets.
    Securities are further classified as debt or equity. Debt instruments (also called
fixed-income instruments) are promises to repay borrowed money. Equities represent
ownership in companies. Pooled investment vehicle shares represent ownership of an
undivided interest in an investment portfolio. The portfolio may include securities,
currencies, contracts, commodities, or real assets. Pooled investment vehicles, such
as exchange-traded funds, which exclusively own shares in other companies, generally
are also considered equities.
    Securities are also classified by whether they are public or private securities. Public
securities are those registered to trade in public markets, such as on exchanges or
through dealers. In most jurisdictions, issuers must meet stringent minimum regu-
latory standards, including reporting and corporate governance standards, to issue
publicly traded securities.
    Private securities are all other securities. Often, only specially qualified investors
can purchase private equities and private debt instruments. Investors may purchase
them directly from the issuer or indirectly through an investment vehicle specifically
formed to hold such securities. Issuers often issue private securities when they find
public reporting standards too burdensome or when they do not want to conform
to the regulatory standards associated with public equity. Venture capital is private
equity that investors supply to companies when or shortly after they are founded.
Private securities generally are illiquid. In contrast, many public securities trade in
liquid markets in which sellers can easily find buyers for their securities.
    Contracts are derivative contracts if their values depend on the prices of other
underlying assets. Derivative contracts may be classified as physical or financial
depending on whether the underlying instruments are physical products or finan-
cial securities. Equity derivatives are contracts whose values depend on equities or
indexes of equities. Fixed-income derivatives are contracts whose values depend on
debt securities or indexes of debt securities.
    Practitioners classify markets by whether the markets trade instruments for
immediate delivery or for future delivery. Markets that trade contracts that call for
delivery in the future are forward or futures markets. Those that trade for immediate
delivery are called spot markets to distinguish them from forward markets that trade
contracts on the same underlying instruments. Options markets trade contracts that
deliver in the future, but delivery takes place only if the holders of the options choose
to exercise them.
    When issuers sell securities to investors, practitioners say that they trade in the
primary market. When investors sell those securities to others, they trade in the
secondary market. In the primary market, funds flow to the issuer of the security
from the purchaser. In the secondary market, funds flow between traders.

                             Practitioners classify financial markets as money markets or capital markets. Money
                         markets trade debt instruments maturing in one year or less. The most common
                         such instruments are repurchase agreements (defined in Section 3.2.1), negotiable
                         certificates of deposit, government bills, and commercial paper. In contrast, capital
                         markets trade instruments of longer duration, such as bonds and equities, whose
                         values depend on the credit-worthiness of the issuers and on payments of interest or
                         dividends that will be made in the future and may be uncertain. Corporations generally
                         finance their operations in the capital markets, but some also finance a portion of their
                         operations by issuing short-term securities, such as commercial paper.
                             Finally, practitioners distinguish between traditional investment markets and
                         alternative investment markets. Traditional investments include all publicly traded
                         debts and equities and shares in pooled investment vehicles that hold publicly traded
                         debts and/or equities. Alternative investments include hedge funds, private equi-
                         ties (including venture capital), commodities, real estate securities and real estate
                         properties, securitized debts, operating leases, machinery, collectibles, and precious
                         gems. Because these investments are often hard to trade and hard to value, they may
                         sometimes trade at substantial deviations from their intrinsic values. The discounts
                         compensate investors for the research that they must do to value these assets and
                         for their inability to easily sell the assets if they need to liquidate a portion of their
                         portfolios.
                             The remainder of this section describes the most common assets and contracts
                         that people, companies, and governments trade.

                            Asset and Market Classification
                            The investment policy of a mutual fund only permits the fund to invest in pub-
                            lic equities traded in secondary markets. Would the fund be able to purchase:

                            1. Common stock of a company that trades on a large stock exchange?

                            Solution to 1:
                               Yes. Common stock is equity. Those common stocks that trade on large
                               exchanges invariably are public equities that trade in secondary markets.

                            2. Common stock of a public company that trades only through dealers?

                            Solution to 2:
                               Yes. Dealer markets are secondary markets and the security is a public
                               equity.

                            3. A government bond?

                            Solution to 3:
                               No. Although government bonds are public securities, they are not equities.
                               They are debt securities.

                            4. A single stock futures contract?

                            Solution to 4:
                               No. Although the underlying instruments for single stock futures are
                               invariably public equities, single stock futures are derivative contracts, not
                               equities.
Securities                                                                                      15


   5. Common stock sold for the first time by a properly registered public
      company?

   Solution to 5:
      No. The fund would not be able to buy these shares because a purchase from
      the issuer would be in the primary market. The fund would have to wait
      until it could buy the shares from someone other than the issuer.

   6. Shares in a privately held bank with €10 billion of capital?

   Solution to 6:
      No. These shares are private equities, not public equities. The public prom-
      inence of the company does not make its securities public securities unless
      they have been properly registered as public securities.




SECURITIES
                                                                                            4
              describe the major types of securities, currencies, contracts,
              commodities, and real assets that trade in organized markets,
              including their distinguishing characteristics and major subtypes

People, companies, and governments sell securities to raise money. Securities include
bonds, notes, commercial paper, mortgages, common stocks, preferred stocks, warrants,
mutual fund shares, unit trusts, and depository receipts. These can be classified broadly
as fixed-income instruments, equities, and shares in pooled investment vehicles. Note
that the legal definition of a security varies by country and may or may not coincide
with the usage here. Securities that are sold to the public or that can be resold to the
public are called issues. Companies and governments are the most common issuers.


Fixed Income
Fixed-income instruments contractually include predetermined payment schedules
that usually include interest and principal payments. Fixed-income instruments
generally are promises to repay borrowed money but may include other instruments
with payment schedules, such as settlements of legal cases or prizes from lotteries.
The payment amounts may be pre-specified or they may vary according to a fixed
formula that depends on the future values of an interest rate or a commodity price.
Bonds, notes, bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, repurchase agreements,
loan agreements, and mortgages are examples of promises to repay money in the
future. People, companies, and governments create fixed-income instruments when
they borrow money.
    Corporations and governments issue bonds and notes. Fixed-income securities with
shorter maturities are called “notes,” those with longer maturities are called “bonds.”
The cutoff is usually at 10 years. In practice, however, the terms are generally used
interchangeably. Both become short-term instruments when the remaining time until
maturity is short, usually taken to be one year or less.
16   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                             Some corporations issue convertible bonds, which are typically convertible into
                         stock, usually at the option of the holder after some period. If stock prices are high so
                         that conversion is likely, convertibles are valued like stock. Conversely, if stock prices
                         are low so that conversion is unlikely, convertibles are valued like bonds.
                             Bills, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper are respectively issued by
                         governments, banks, and corporations. They usually mature within a year of being
                         issued; certificates of deposit sometimes have longer initial maturities.
                             Repurchase agreements (repos) are short-term lending instruments. The term can
                         be as short as overnight. A borrower seeking funds will sell an instrument—typically
                         a high-quality bond—to a lender with an agreement to repurchase it later at a slightly
                         higher price based on an agreed upon interest rate.
                             Practitioners distinguish between short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term
                         fixed-income securities. No general consensus exists about the definition of short-term,
                         intermediate-term, and long-term. Instruments that mature in less than one to two
                         years are considered short-term instruments whereas those that mature in more
                         than five to ten years are considered long-term instruments. In the middle are
                         intermediate-term instruments.
                             Instruments trading in money markets are called money market instruments. Such
                         instruments are traded debt instruments maturing in one year or less. Money market
                         funds and corporations seeking a return on their short-term cash balances typically
                         hold money market instruments.


                         Equities
                         Equities represent ownership rights in companies. These include common and pre-
                         ferred shares. Common shareholders own residual rights to the assets of the company.
                         They have the right to receive any dividends declared by the boards of directors, and
                         in the event of liquidation, any assets remaining after all other claims are paid. Acting
                         through the boards of directors that they elect, common shareholders usually can
                         select the managers who run the corporations.
                             Preferred shares are equities that have preferred rights (relative to common
                         shares) to the cash flows and assets of the company. Preferred shareholders generally
                         have the right to receive a specific dividend on a regular basis. If the preferred share
                         is a cumulative preferred equity, the company must pay the preferred shareholders
                         any previously omitted dividends before it can pay dividends to the common share-
                         holders. Preferred shareholders also have higher claims to assets relative to common
                         shareholders in the event of corporate liquidation. For valuation purposes, financial
                         analysts generally treat preferred stocks as fixed-income securities when the issuers
                         will clearly be able to pay their promised dividends in the foreseeable future.
                             Warrants are securities issued by a corporation that allow the warrant holders to
                         buy a security issued by that corporation, if they so desire, usually at any time before
                         the warrants expire or, if not, upon expiration. The security that warrant holders can
                         buy usually is the issuer’s common stock, in which case the warrants are considered
                         equities because the warrant holders can obtain equity in the company by exercising
                         their warrants. The warrant exercise price is the price that the warrant holder must
                         pay to buy the security.
Securities                                                                                  17


EXAMPLE 6

   Securities

   1. What factors distinguish fixed-income securities from equities?

   Solution:
      Fixed-income securities generate income on a regular schedule. They derive
      their value from the promise to pay a scheduled cash flow. The most com-
      mon fixed-income securities are promises made by people, companies, and
      governments to repay loans.
      Equities represent residual ownership in companies after all other claims—
      including any fixed-income liabilities of the company—have been satisfied.
      For corporations, the claims of preferred equities typically have priority over
      the claims of common equities. Common equities have the residual owner-
      ship in corporations.



Pooled Investments
Pooled investment vehicles are mutual funds, trusts, depositories, and hedge funds,
that issue securities that represent shared ownership in the assets that these entities
hold. The securities created by mutual funds, trusts, depositories, and hedge fund
are respectively called shares, units, depository receipts, and limited partnership
interests but practitioners often use these terms interchangeably. People invest in
pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of
their managers and from diversification opportunities that are not readily available
to them on an individual basis.
    Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from many investors for
investment in a portfolio of securities. They are often legally organized as investment
trusts or as corporate investment companies. Pooled investment vehicles may be
open-ended or closed-ended. Open-ended funds issue new shares and redeem existing
shares on demand, usually on a daily basis. The price at which a fund redeems and
sells the fund’s shares is based on the net asset value of the fund’s portfolio, which
is the difference between the fund’s assets and liabilities, expressed on a per share
basis. Investors generally buy and sell open-ended mutual funds by trading with the
mutual fund.
    In contrast, closed-end funds issue shares in primary market offerings that the fund
or its investment bankers arrange. Once issued, investors cannot sell their shares of
the fund back to the fund by demanding redemption. Instead, investors in closed-end
funds must sell their shares to other investors in the secondary market. The secondary
market prices of closed-end funds may differ—sometimes quite significantly—from
their net asset values. Closed-end funds generally trade at a discount to their net asset
values. The discount reflects the expenses of running the fund and sometimes investor
concerns about the quality of the management. Closed-end funds may also trade at
a discount or a premium to net asset value when investors believe that the portfolio
securities are overvalued or undervalued. Many financial analysts thus believe that
discounts and premiums on closed-end funds measure market sentiment.
    Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are open-ended
funds that investors can trade among themselves in secondary markets. The prices at
which ETFs trade rarely differ much from net asset values because a class of investors,
known as authorized participants (APs), has the option of trading directly with the
ETF. If the market price of an equity ETF is sufficiently below its net asset value, APs
18   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                         will buy shares in the secondary market at market price and redeem shares at net
                         asset value with the fund. Conversely, if the price of an ETF is sufficiently above its
                         net asset value, APs will buy shares from the fund at net asset value and sell shares
                         in the secondary market at market price. As a result, the market price and net asset
                         values of ETFs tend to converge.
                             Many ETFs permit only in-kind deposits and redemptions. Buyers who buy directly
                         from such a fund pay for their shares with a portfolio of securities rather than with
                         cash. Similarly, sellers receive a portfolio of securities. The transaction portfolio gen-
                         erally is very similar—often essentially identical—to the portfolio held by the fund.
                         Practitioners sometimes call such funds “depositories” because they issue depository
                         receipts for the portfolios that traders deposit with them. The traders then trade the
                         receipts in the secondary market. Some warehouses holding industrial materials and
                         precious metals also issue tradable warehouse receipts.
                             Asset-backed securities are securities whose values and income payments are
                         derived from a pool of assets, such as mortgage bonds, credit card debt, or car loans.
                         These securities typically pass interest and principal payments received from the pool
                         of assets through to their holders on a monthly basis. These payments may depend
                         on formulas that give some classes of securities—called tranches—backed by the pool
                         more value than other classes.
                             Hedge funds are investment funds that generally organize as limited partnerships.
                         The hedge fund managers are the general partners. The limited partners are qualified
                         investors who are wealthy enough and well informed enough to tolerate and accept
                         substantial losses, should they occur. The regulatory requirements to participate in a
                         hedge fund and the regulatory restrictions on hedge funds vary by jurisdiction. Most
                         hedge funds follow only one investment strategy, but no single investment strategy
                         characterizes hedge funds as a group. Hedge funds exist that follow almost every
                         imaginable strategy ranging from long–short arbitrage in the stock markets to direct
                         investments in exotic alternative assets.
                             The primary distinguishing characteristic of hedge funds is their management
                         compensation scheme. Almost all funds pay their managers with an annual fee that is
                         proportional to their assets and with an additional performance fee that depends on
                         the wealth that the funds generate for their shareholders. A secondary distinguishing
                         characteristic of many hedge funds is the use of leverage to increase risk exposure
                         and to hopefully increase returns.




             5           CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND REAL ASSETS

                                       describe the major types of securities, currencies, contracts,
                                       commodities, and real assets that trade in organized markets,
                                       including their distinguishing characteristics and major subtypes

                         Currencies are monies issued by national monetary authorities. Approximately 180
                         currencies are currently in use throughout the world. Some of these currencies are
                         regarded as reserve currencies. Reserve currencies are currencies that national central
                         banks and other monetary authorities hold in significant quantities. The primary reserve
                         currencies are the US dollar and the euro. Secondary reserve currencies include the
                         British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc.
Currencies, Commodities, and Real Assets                                                      19


    Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets. In spot currency transactions, one
currency is immediately or almost immediately exchanged for another. The rate of
exchange is called the spot exchange rate. Traders typically negotiate institutional trades
in multiples of large quantities, such as US$1 million or ¥100 million. Institutional
trades generally settle in two business days.
    Retail currency trades most commonly take place through commercial banks when
their customers exchange currencies at a location of the bank, use ATM machines
when travelling to withdraw a different currency than the currency in which their
bank accounts are denominated, or use credit cards to buy items priced in different
currencies. Retail currency trades also take place at airport kiosks, at store front
currency exchanges, or on the street.


Commodities
Commodities include precious metals, energy products, industrial metals, agricul-
tural products, and carbon credits. Spot commodity markets trade commodities for
immediate delivery whereas the forward and futures markets trade commodities for
future delivery. Managers seeking positions in commodities can acquire them directly
by trading in the spot markets or indirectly by trading forward and futures contracts.
    The producers and processors of industrial metals and agricultural products are
the primary users of the spot commodity markets because they generally are best
able to take and make delivery and to store physical products. They undertake these
activities in the normal course of operating their businesses. Their ability to handle
physical products and the information that they gather operating businesses also
gives them substantial advantages as information-motivated traders in these markets.
Many producers employ financial analysts to help them analyze commodity market
conditions so that they can best manage their inventories to hedge their operational
risks and to speculate on future price changes.
    Commodities also interest information-motivated traders and investment managers
because they can use them as hedges against risks that they hold in their portfolios or
as vehicles to speculate on future price changes. Most such traders take positions in
the futures markets because they usually do not have facilities to handle most physical
products nor can they easily obtain them. They also cannot easily cope with the normal
variation in qualities that characterizes many commodities. Information-motivated
traders and investment managers also prefer to trade in futures markets because
most futures markets are more liquid than their associated spot markets and forward
markets. The liquidity allows them to easily close their positions before delivery so
that they can avoid handling physical products.
    Some information-motivated traders and investment managers, however, trade in
the spot commodity markets, especially when they can easily contract for low-cost
storage. Commodities for which delivery and storage costs are lowest are nonperish-
able products for which the ratio of value to weight is high and variation in quality is
low. These generally include precious metals, industrial diamonds, such high-value
industrial metals as copper, aluminum, and mercury, and carbon credits.


Real Assets
Real assets include such tangible properties as real estate, airplanes, machinery,
or lumber stands. These assets normally are held by operating companies, such as
real estate developers, airplane leasing companies, manufacturers, or loggers. Many
institutional investment managers, however, have been adding real assets to their
portfolios as direct investments (involving direct ownership of the real assets) and
indirect investments (involving indirect ownership, for example, purchase of securities
of companies that invest in real assets or real estate investment trusts). Investments
20   Learning Module 1                                                                Market Organization and Structure


                         in real assets are attractive to them because of the income and tax benefits that they
                         often generate, and because changes in their values may have a low correlation with
                         other investments that the managers hold.
                             Direct investments in real assets generally require substantial management to ensure
                         that the assets are maintained and used efficiently. Investment managers investing in
                         such assets must either hire personnel to manage them or hire outside management
                         companies. Either way, management of real assets is quite costly.
                             Real assets are unique properties in the sense that no two assets are alike. An
                         example of a unique property is a real estate parcel. No two parcels are the same
                         because, if nothing else, they are located in different places. Real assets generally
                         differ in their conditions, remaining useful lives, locations, and suitability for various
                         purposes. These differences are very important to the people who use them, so the
                         market for a given real asset may be very limited. Thus, real assets tend to trade in
                         very illiquid markets.
                             The heterogeneity of real assets, their illiquidity, and the substantial costs of man-
                         aging them are all factors that complicate the valuation of real assets and generally
                         make them unsuitable for most investment portfolios. These same problems, however,
                         often cause real assets to be misvalued in the market, so astute information-motivated
                         traders may occasionally identify significantly undervalued assets. The benefits from
                         purchasing such assets, however, are often offset by the substantial costs of searching
                         for them and by the substantial costs of managing them.
                             Many financial intermediaries create entities, such as real estate investment trusts
                         (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs), to securitize real assets and to facilitate
                         indirect investment in real assets. The financial intermediaries manage the assets and
                         pass through the net benefits after management costs to the investors who hold these
                         securities. Because these securities are much more homogenous and divisible than
                         the real assets that they represent, they tend to trade in much more liquid markets.
                         Thus, they are much more suitable as investments than the real assets themselves.
                             Of course, investors seeking exposure to real assets can also buy shares in cor-
                         porations that hold and operate real assets. Although almost all corporations hold
                         and operate real assets, many specialize in assets that particularly interest investors
                         seeking exposure to specific real asset classes. For example, investors interested in
                         owning aircraft can buy an aircraft leasing company such as Waha Capital (Abu Dhabi
                         Securities Exchange) and Aircastle Limited (NYSE).

   1. Which of these represent ownership in corporations?

   Solution to 1:
      Common and preferred stocks represent ownership in corporations.

   2. Which of these are debt instruments?

   Solution to 2:
      Bank deposits, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, mortgages, and
      Treasury notes are all debt instruments. They respectively represent loans
      made to banks, corporations, mortgagees (typically real estate owners), and
      the Treasury.

   3. Which of these are created by traders rather than by issuers?

   Solution to 3:
      Lumber forward contracts, crude oil futures contracts, stock option con-
      tracts, and interest rate swaps are created when the seller sells them to a
      buyer.

   4. Which of these are pooled investment vehicles?

   Solution to 4:
      Exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and mutual funds are pooled invest-
      ment vehicles. They represent shared ownership in a portfolio of other
      assets.

   5. Which of these are real assets?

   Solution to 5:
      Real estate parcels are real assets.

   6. Which of these would a home builder most likely use to hedge construction
      costs?

   Solution to 6:
      A builder would buy lumber forward contracts to lock in the price of lumber
      needed to build homes.

   7. Which of these would a corporation trade when moving cash balances
      among various countries?

   Solution to 7:
      Corporations often trade currencies when moving cash from one country to
      another.

             6           CONTRACTS

                                       describe the major types of securities, currencies, contracts,
                                       commodities, and real assets that trade in organized markets,
                                       including their distinguishing characteristics and major subtypes

                         A contract is an agreement among traders to do something in the future. Contracts
                         include forward, futures, swap, option, and insurance contracts. The values of most
                         contracts depend on the value of an underlying asset. The underlying asset may be
                         a commodity, a security, an index representing the values of other instruments, a
                         currency pair or basket, or other contracts.
                             Contracts provide for some physical or cash settlement in the future. In a phys-
                         ically settled contract, settlement occurs when the parties to the contract physically
                         exchange some item, such as avocados, pork bellies, or gold bars. Physical settlement
                         also includes the delivery of such financial instruments as bonds, equities, or futures
                         contracts even though the delivery is electronic. In contrast, cash settled contracts
                         settle through cash payments. The amount of the payment depends on formulas
                         specified in the contracts.
                             Financial analysts classify contracts by whether they are physical or financial based
                         on the nature of the underlying asset. If the underlying asset is a physical product,
                         the contract is a physical; otherwise, the contract is a financial. Examples of assets
                         classified as physical include contracts for the delivery of petroleum, lumber, and gold.
                         Examples of assets classified as financial include option contracts, and contracts on
                         interest rates, stock indexes, currencies, and credit default swaps.
                             Contracts that call for immediate delivery are called spot contracts, and they trade
                         in spot markets. Immediate delivery generally is three days or less, but depends on
                         each market. All other contracts involve what practitioners call futurity. They derive
                         their values from events that will take place in the future.

                         EXAMPLE 8

                            Contracts for Difference
                            Contracts for difference (CFD) allow people to speculate on price changes for
                            an underlying asset, such as a common stock or an index. Dealers generally
                            sell CFDs to their clients. When the clients sell the CFDs back to their dealer,
                            they receive any appreciation in the underlying asset’s price between the time
                            of purchase and sale (open and close) of the contract. If the underlying asset’s
                            price drops over this interval, the client pays the dealer the difference.

                            1. Are contracts for difference derivative contracts?

                            Solution to 1:
                               Contracts for difference are derivative contracts because their values are
                               derived from changes in the prices of the underlying asset on which they are
                               based.
Contracts                                                                                    23


   2. Are contracts for difference based on copper prices cash settled or physical-
      ly settled?

   Solution to 2:
      All contracts for difference are cash settled contracts regardless of the un-
      derlying asset on which they are based because they settle in cash and not in
      the underlying asset.



Forward Contracts
A forward contract is an agreement to trade the underlying asset in the future at a
price agreed upon today. For example, a contract for the sale of wheat after the harvest
is a forward contract. People often use forward contracts to reduce risk. Before plant-
ing wheat, farmers like to know the price at which they will sell their crop. Similarly,
before committing to sell flour to bakers in the future, millers like to know the prices
that they will pay for wheat. The farmer and the miller both reduce their operating
risks by agreeing to trade wheat forward.
     Practitioners call such traders hedgers because they use their contractual com-
mitments to hedge their risks. If the price of wheat falls, the wheat farmer’s crop will
drop in value on the spot market but he has a contract to sell wheat in the future at
a higher fixed price. The forward contract has become more valuable to the farmer.
Conversely, if the price of wheat rises, the miller’s future obligation to sell flour will
become more burdensome because of the high price he would have to pay for wheat
on the spot market, but the miller has a contract to buy wheat at a lower fixed price.
The forward contract has become more valuable to the miller. In both cases, fluc-
tuations in the spot price are hedged by the forward contract. The forward contract
offsets the operating risks that the hedgers face.
     Consider a simple example of hedging. An avocado farmer in Mexico expects to
harvest 15,000 kilograms of avocados and that the price at harvest will be 60 pesos
per kilogram. That price, however, could fluctuate significantly before the harvest. If
the price of avocados drops to 50 pesos, the farmer would lose 10 pesos per kilogram
(60 pesos – 50 pesos) relative to his expectations, or a total of 150,000 pesos. Now,
suppose that the farmer can sell avocados forward to Del Rey Avocado at 58 pesos for
delivery at the harvest. If the farmer sells 15,000 kilograms forward, and the price of
avocados drops to 50 pesos, the farmer would still be able to sell his avocados for 58
pesos, and thus would not suffer from the drop in the price of avocados below this level.

EXAMPLE 9

   Hedging Gold Production
   A Zimbabwean gold producer invests in a mine expansion project on the expec-
   tation that gold prices will remain at or above $1,200 USD per ounce when the
   new project starts producing ore.

   1. What risks does the gold producer face with respect to the price of gold?

   Solution to 1:
      The gold producer faces the risk that the price of gold could fall below
      $1,200 USD before it can sell its new production. If so, the investment in
      the expansion project will be less profitable than expected, and may even
      generate losses for the mine.

                            2. How might the gold producer hedge its gold price risk?

                            Solution to 2:
                               The gold producer could hedge the gold price risk by selling gold forward,
                               hopefully at a price near $1,200 USD. Even if the price of gold falls, the gold
                               producer would get paid the contract price.

                             Forward contracts are very common, but two problems limit their usefulness for
                         many market participants. The first problem is counterparty risk. Counterparty risk
                         is the risk that the other party to a contract will fail to honor the terms of the con-
                         tract. Concerns about counterparty risk ensure that generally only parties who have
                         long-standing relationships with each other execute forward contracts. Trustworthiness
                         is critical when prices are volatile because, after a large price change, one side or the
                         other may prefer not to settle the contract.
                             The second problem is liquidity. Trading out of a forward contract is very difficult
                         because it can only be done with the consent of the other party. The liquidity problem
                         ensures that forward contracts tend to be executed only among participants for whom
                         delivery is economically efficient and quite certain at the time of contracting so that
                         both parties will want to arrange for delivery.
                             The counterparty risk problem and the liquidity problem often make it difficult for
                         market participants to obtain the hedging benefits associated with forward contract-
                         ing. Fortunately, futures contracts have been developed to mitigate these problems.


                         Futures Contracts
                         A futures contract is a standardized forward contract for which a clearinghouse
                         guarantees the performance of all traders. The buyer of a futures contract is the side
                         that will take physical delivery or its cash equivalent. The seller of a futures contract
                         is the side that is liable for the delivery or its cash equivalent. A clearinghouse is an
                         organization that ensures that no trader is harmed if another trader fails to honor
                         the contract. In effect, the clearinghouse acts as the buyer for every seller and as the
                         seller for every buyer. Buyers and sellers, therefore, can trade futures without wor-
                         rying whether their counterparties are creditworthy. Because futures contracts are
                         standardized, a buyer can eliminate his obligation to buy by selling his contract to
                         anyone. A seller similarly can eliminate her obligation to deliver by buying a contract
                         from anyone. In either case, the clearinghouse will release the trader from all future
                         obligations if his or her long and short positions exactly offset each other.
                             To protect against defaults, futures clearinghouses require that all participants
                         post with the clearinghouse an amount of money known as initial margin when
                         they enter a contract. The clearinghouse then settles the margin accounts on a daily
                         basis. All participants who have lost on their contracts that day will have the amount
                         of their losses deducted from their margin by the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse
                         similarly increases margins for all participants who gained on that day. Participants
                         whose margins drop below the required maintenance margin must replenish their
                         accounts. If a participant does not provide sufficient additional margin when required,
                         the participant’s broker will immediately trade to offset the participant’s position.
                         These variation margin payments ensure that the liabilities associated with futures
                         contracts do not grow large.
Contracts                                                                                  25


EXAMPLE 10

  Futures Margin

  1. NYMEX’s Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contract specifies the delivery of
     1,000 barrels of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil when the contract final-
     ly settles. A broker requires that its clients post an initial overnight margin
     of $7,763 per contract and an overnight maintenance margin of $5,750 per
     contract. A client buys ten contracts at $75 per barrel through this broker.
     On the next day, the contract settles for $72 per barrel. How much addition-
     al margin will the client have to provide to his broker?

  Solution:
     The client lost three dollars per barrel (he is the side committed to take
     delivery or its cash equivalent at $75 per barrel). This results in a $3,000 loss
     on each of his 10 contracts, and a total loss of $30,000. His initial margin
     of $77,630 is reduced by $30,000 leaving $47,630 in his margin account.
     Because his account has dropped below the maintenance margin require-
     ment of $57,500, the client will get a margin call. The client must provide an
     additional $30,000 = $77,630 – $47,630 to replenish his margin account; the
     account is replenished to the amount of the initial margin. The client will
     only receive another margin call if his account drops to below $57,500 again.

     Futures contracts have vastly improved the efficiency of forward contracting mar-
kets. Traders can trade standardized futures contracts with anyone without worrying
about counterparty risk, and they can close their positions by arranging offsetting
trades. Hedgers for whom the terms of the standard contract are not ideal generally
still use the futures markets because the contracts embody most of the price risk that
concerns them. They simply offset (close out) their futures positions, at the same time
they enter spot contracts on which they make or take ultimate delivery.

EXAMPLE 11

  Forward and Futures Contracts

  1. What feature most distinguishes futures contracts from forward contracts?

  Solution:
     A futures contract is a standardized forward contract for which a clearing-
     house guarantees the performance of all buyers and sellers. The clearing-
     house reduces the counterparty risk problem. The clearinghouse allows a
     buyer who has bought a contract from one person and sold the same con-
     tract to another person to net out the two obligations so that she is no lon-
     ger liable for either side of the contract; the positions are closed. The ability
     to trade futures contracts provides liquidity in futures contracts compared
     with forward contracts.



Swap Contracts
A swap contract is an agreement to exchange payments of periodic cash flows that
depend on future asset prices or interest rates. For example, in a typical interest rate
swap, at periodic intervals, one party makes fixed cash payments to the counterparty
26   Learning Module 1                                                           Market Organization and Structure


                         in exchange for variable cash payments from the counterparty. The variable payments
                         are based on a pre-specified variable interest rate such as the London Interbank Offered
                         Rate (Libor). This swap effectively exchanges fixed interest payments for variable
                         interest payments. Because the variable rate is set in the future, the cash flows for
                         this contract are uncertain when the parties enter the contract.
                             Investment managers often enter interest rate swaps when they own a fixed
                         long-term income stream that they want to convert to a cash flow that varies with
                         current short-term interest rates, or vice versa. The conversion may allow them to
                         substantially reduce the total interest rate risk to which they are exposed. Hedgers
                         often use swap contracts to manage risks.
                             In a commodity swap, one party typically makes fixed payments in exchange for
                         payments that depend on future prices of a commodity such as oil. In a currency
                         swap, the parties exchange payments denominated in different currencies. The pay-
                         ments may be fixed, or they may vary depending on future interest rates in the two
                         countries. In an equity swap, the parties exchange fixed cash payments for payments
                         that depend on the returns to a stock or a stock index.

                         EXAMPLE 12

                            Swap and Forward Contracts

                            1. What feature most distinguishes a swap contract from a cash-settled for-
                               ward contract?

                            Solution:
                               Both contracts provide for the exchange of cash payments in the future. A
                               forward contract only has a single cash payment at the end that depends on
                               an underlying price or index at the end. In contrast, a swap contract has sev-
                               eral scheduled periodic payments, each of which depends on an underlying
                               price or index at the time of the payment.



                         Option Contracts
                         An option contract allows the holder (the purchaser) of the option to buy or sell,
                         depending on the type of option, an underlying instrument at a specified price at or
                         before a specified date in the future. Those that do buy or sell are said to exercise their
                         contracts. An option to buy is a call option, and an option to sell is a put option. The
                         specified price is called the strike price (exercise price). If the holders can exercise
                         their contracts only when they mature, they are European-style contracts. If they can
                         exercise the contracts earlier, they are American-style contracts. Many exchanges list
                         standardized option contracts on individual stocks, stock indexes, futures contracts,
                         currencies, swaps, and precious metals. Institutions also trade many customized option
                         contracts with dealers in the over-the-counter derivative market.
                             Option holders generally will exercise call options if the strike price is below the
                         market price of the underlying instrument, in which case, they will be able to buy at a
                         lower price than the market price. Similarly, they will exercise put options if the strike
                         price is above the underlying instrument price so that they sell at a higher price than
                         the market price. Otherwise, option holders allow their options to expire as worthless.
                             The price that traders pay for an option is the option premium. Options can be
                         quite expensive because, unlike forward and futures contracts, they do not impose
                         any liability on the holder. The premium compensates the sellers of options—called
                         option writers—for giving the call option holders the right to potentially buy below
Financial Intermediaries                                                                           27


market prices and put option holders the right to potentially sell above market prices.
Because the writers must trade if the holders exercise their options, option contracts
may impose substantial liabilities on the writers.

EXAMPLE 13

   Option and Forward Contracts

   1. What feature most distinguishes option contracts from forward contracts?

   Solution:
      The holder of an option contract has the right, but not the obligation, to
      buy (for a call option) or sell (for a put option) the underlying instrument
      at some time in the future. The writer of an option contract must trade the
      underlying instrument if the holder exercises the option.
      In contrast, the two parties to a forward contract must trade the underlying
      instrument (or its equivalent value for a cash-settled contract) at some time
      in the future if either party wants to settle the contract.



Other Contracts
Insurance contracts pay their beneficiaries a cash benefit if some event occurs. Life,
liability, and automobile insurance are examples of insurance contracts sold to retail
clients. People generally use insurance contracts to compensate for losses that they
will experience if bad things happen unexpectedly. Insurance contracts allow them
to hedge risks that they face.
    Credit default swaps (CDS) are insurance contracts that promise payment of
principal in the event that a company defaults on its bonds. Bondholders use credit
default swaps to convert risky bonds into more secure investments. Other creditors
of the company may also buy them to hedge against the risk they will not be paid if
the company goes bankrupt.
    Well-informed traders who believe that a corporation will default on its bonds
may buy credit default swaps written on the corporation’s bonds if the swap prices
are sufficiently low. If they are correct, the traders will profit if the payoff to the swap
is more than the cost of buying and maintaining the swap position.
    People sometimes also buy insurance contracts as investments, especially in juris-
dictions where payouts from insurance contracts are not subject to as much taxation as
are payouts to other investment vehicles. They may buy these contracts directly from
insurance companies, or they may buy already issued contracts from their owners.
For example, the life settlements market trades life insurance contracts that people
sell to investors when they need cash.




FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
                                                                                               7
              describe types of financial intermediaries and services that they
              provide
28   Learning Module 1                                                            Market Organization and Structure


                         Financial intermediaries help entities achieve their financial goals. These intermedi-
                         aries include commercial, mortgage, and investment banks; credit unions, credit card
                         companies, and various other finance corporations; brokers and exchanges; dealers
                         and arbitrageurs; clearinghouses and depositories; mutual funds and hedge funds;
                         and insurance companies. The services and products that financial intermediaries
                         provide allow their clients to solve the financial problems that they face more effi-
                         ciently than they could do so by themselves. Financial intermediaries are essential to
                         well-functioning financial systems.
                             Financial intermediaries are called intermediaries because the services and prod-
                         ucts that they provide help connect buyers to sellers in various ways. Whether the
                         connections are easy to identify or involve complex financial structures, financial
                         intermediaries stand between one or more buyers and one or more sellers and help
                         them transfer capital and risk between them. Financial intermediaries’ activities allow
                         buyers and sellers to benefit from trading, often without any knowledge of the other.
                             This section introduces the main financial intermediaries that provide services and
                         products in well-developed financial markets. The discussion starts with those inter-
                         mediaries whose services most obviously connect buyers to sellers and then proceeds
                         to those intermediaries whose services create more subtle connections. Because many
                         financial intermediaries provide many different types of services, some are mentioned
                         more than once. The section concludes with a general characterization of the various
                         ways in which financial intermediaries add value to the financial system.


                         Brokers, Exchanges, and Alternative Trading Systems
                         Brokers are agents who fill orders for their clients. They do not trade with their clients.
                         Instead, they search for traders who are willing to take the other side of their clients’
                         orders. Individual brokers may work for large brokerage firms, the brokerage arm of
                         banks, or at exchanges. Some brokers match clients to clients personally. Others use
                         specialized computer systems to identify potential trades and help their clients fill
                         their orders. Brokers help their clients trade by reducing the costs of finding coun-
                         terparties for their trades.
                              Block brokers provide brokerage service to large traders. Large orders are hard
                         to fill because finding a counterparty willing to do a large trade is often quite difficult.
                         A large buy order generally will trade at a premium to the current market price, and
                         a large sell order generally will trade at a discount to the current market price. These
                         price concessions encourage other traders to trade with the large traders. They also
                         make large traders reluctant, however, to expose their orders to the public before
                         their trades are arranged because they do not want to move the market. Block bro-
                         kers, therefore, carefully manage the exposure of the orders entrusted to them, which
                         makes filling them difficult.
                              Investment banks provide advice to their mostly corporate clients and help them
                         arrange transactions such as initial and seasoned securities offerings. Their corporate
                         finance divisions help corporations finance their business by issuing securities, such
                         as common and preferred shares, notes, and bonds. Another function of corporate
                         finance divisions is to help companies identify and acquire other companies (i.e., in
                         mergers and acquisitions).
                              Exchanges provide places where traders can meet to arrange their trades.
                         Historically, brokers and dealers met on an exchange floor to negotiate trades.
                         Increasingly, exchanges arrange trades for traders based on orders that brokers and
                         dealers submit to them. Such exchanges essentially act as brokers. The distinction
                         between exchanges and brokers has become quite blurred. Exchanges and brokers
                         that use electronic order matching systems to arrange trades among their clients are
Financial Intermediaries                                                                   29


functionally indistinguishable in this respect. Examples of exchanges include the NYSE,
Eurex, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, and the Singapore Exchange.
    Exchanges are easily distinguished from brokers by their regulatory operations.
Most exchanges regulate their members’ behavior when trading on the exchange, and
sometimes away from the exchange.
    Many securities exchanges regulate the issuers that list their securities on the
exchange. These regulations generally require timely financial disclosure. Financial
analysts use this information to value the securities traded at the exchange. Without
such disclosure, valuing securities could be very difficult and market prices might
not reflect the fundamental values of the securities. In such situations, well-informed
participants may profit from less-informed participants. To avoid such losses, the
less-informed participants may withdraw from the market, which can greatly increase
corporate costs of capital.
    Some exchanges also prohibit issuers from creating capital structures that would
concentrate voting rights in the hands of a few owners who do not own a commen-
surate share of the equity. These regulations attempt to ensure that corporations are
run for the benefit of all shareholders and not to promote the interests of controlling
shareholders who do not have significant economic stakes in the company.
    Exchanges derive their regulatory authority from their national or regional govern-
ments, or through the voluntary agreements of their members and issuers to subject
themselves to the exchange regulations. In most countries, government regulators
oversee the exchange rules and the regulatory operations. Most countries also impose
financial disclosure standards on public issuers. Examples of government regulatory
bodies include the Japanese Financial Services Agency, the British Financial Conduct
Authority, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission, and the
Argentine National Securities Commission (CNV).
    Alternative trading systems (ATSs), also known as electronic communications
networks (ECNs) or multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) are trading venues that
function like exchanges but that do not exercise regulatory authority over their sub-
scribers except with respect to the conduct of their trading in their trading systems.
Some ATSs operate electronic trading systems that are otherwise indistinguishable
from the trading systems operated by exchanges. Others operate innovative trading
systems that suggest trades to their customers based on information that their cus-
tomers share with them or that they obtain through research into their customers’
preferences. Many ATSs are known as dark pools because they do not display the
orders that their clients send to them. Large investment managers especially like these
systems because market prices often move to their disadvantage when other traders
know about their large orders. ATSs may be owned and operated by broker–dealers,
exchanges, banks, or by companies organized solely for this purpose, many of which
may be owned by a consortia of brokers–dealers and banks. Examples of ATSs include
MATCHNow (Canada), BATS (United States), POSIT (United States), Liquidnet
(United States), Baxter-FX (Ireland), and Turquoise (Europe). Many of these ATSs
provide services in many markets besides the ones in which they are domiciled.


Dealers
Dealers fill their clients’ orders by trading with them. When their clients want to sell
securities or contracts, dealers buy the instruments for their own accounts. If their
clients want to buy securities, dealers sell securities that they own or have borrowed.
After completing a transaction, dealers hope to reverse the transaction by trading
30   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                         with another client on the other side of the market. When they are successful, they
                         effectively connect a buyer who arrived at one point in time with a seller who arrived
                         at another point in time.
                             The service that dealers provide is liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell
                         with low transactions costs when you want to trade. By allowing their clients to trade
                         when they want to trade, dealers provide liquidity to them. In over-the-counter markets,
                         dealers offer liquidity when their clients ask them to trade with them. In exchange
                         markets, dealers offer liquidity to anyone who is willing to trade at the prices that
                         the dealers offer at the exchange. Dealers profit when they can buy at prices that on
                         average are lower than the prices at which they sell.
                             Dealers may organize their operations within proprietary trading houses, invest-
                         ment banks, and hedge funds, or as sole proprietorships. Some dealers are traditional
                         dealers in the sense that individuals make trading decisions. Others use computerized
                         trading to make all trading decisions. Examples of companies with large dealing oper-
                         ations include Deutsche Bank (Germany), RBC Capital Markets (Canada), Nomura
                         Securities (Japan), Timber Hill (United States), Goldman Sachs (United States), and IG
                         Group (United Kingdom). Almost all investment banks have large dealing operations.
                             Most dealers also broker orders, and many brokers deal to their customers.
                         Accordingly, practitioners often use the term broker–dealer to refer to dealers and
                         brokers. Broker–dealers have a conflict of interest with respect to how they fill their
                         customers’ orders. When acting as a broker, they must seek the best price for their
                         customers’ orders. When acting as dealers, however, they profit most when they sell to
                         their customers at high prices or buy from their customers at low prices. The problem
                         is most serious when the customer allows the broker–dealer to decide whether to trade
                         the order with another trader or to fill it as a dealer. Consequently, when trading with
                         a broker–dealer, some customers specify how they want their orders filled. They may
                         also trade only with pure agency brokers who do not also deal.
                             Primary dealers are dealers with whom central banks trade when conducting
                         monetary policy. They buy bills, notes, and bonds when the central banks sell them
                         to decrease the money supply. The dealers then sell these instruments to their clients.
                         Similarly, when the central banks want to increase the money supply, the primary
                         dealers buy these instruments from their clients and sell them to the central banks.

                            1. What characteristic most likely distinguishes brokers from dealers?

                            Solution:
                               Brokers are agents that arrange trades on behalf of their clients. They do
                               not trade with their clients. In contrast, dealers are proprietary traders who
                               trade with their clients.



                         Arbitrageurs
                         Arbitrageurs trade when they can identify opportunities to buy and sell identical or
                         essentially similar instruments at different prices in different markets. They profit when
                         they can buy in one market for less than they sell in another market. Arbitrageurs
                         are financial intermediaries because they connect buyers in one market to sellers in
                         another market.
Financial Intermediaries                                                                      31


    The purest form of arbitrage involves buying and selling the same instrument in
two different markets. Arbitrageurs who do such trades sell to buyers in one market
and buy from sellers in the other market. They provide liquidity to the markets because
they make it easier for buyers and sellers to trade when and where they want to trade.
    Because dealers and arbitrageurs both provide liquidity to other traders, they
compete with each other. The dealers connect buyers and sellers who arrive in the
same market at different times whereas the arbitrageurs connect buyers and sellers
who arrive at the same time in different markets. In practice, traders who profit
from offering liquidity rarely are purely dealers or purely arbitrageurs. Instead, most
traders attempt to identify and exploit every opportunity they can to manage their
inventories profitably.
    If information about prices is readily available to market participants, pure arbi-
trages involving the same instrument will be quite rare. Traders who are well informed
about market conditions usually route their orders to the market offering the best
price so that arbitrageurs will have few opportunities to match traders across markets
when they want to trade the exact same instrument.
    Arbitrageurs often trade securities or contracts whose values depend on the same
underlying factors. For example, dealers in equity option contracts often sell call options
in the contract market and buy the underlying shares in the stock market. Because
the values of the call options and of the underlying shares are closely correlated (the
value of the call increases with the value of the shares), the long stock position hedges
the risk in the short call position so that the dealer’s net position is not too risky.
    Similar to the pure arbitrage that involves the same instrument in different mar-
kets, these arbitrage trades connect buyers in one market to sellers in another market.
In this case, however, the buyers and sellers are interested in different instruments
whose values are closely related. In the example, the buyer is interested in buying a
call options contract, the value of which is a nonlinear function of the value of the
underlying stock; the seller is interested in selling the underlying stock.
    Options dealers buy stock and sell calls when calls are overpriced relative to the
underlying stocks. They use complicated financial models to value options in relation
to underlying stock values, and they use financial engineering techniques to control
the risk of their portfolios. Successful arbitrageurs must know valuation relations well
and they must manage the risk in their portfolios well to trade profitably. They profit
by buying the relatively undervalued instrument and selling the relatively overvalued
instrument.
    Buying a risk in one form and selling it another form involves a process called
replication. Arbitrageurs use various trading strategies to replicate the returns to
securities and contracts. If they can substantially replicate those returns, they can
use the replication trading strategy to offset the risk of buying or selling the actual
securities and contracts. The combined effect of their trading is to transform risk
from one form to another. This process allows them to create or eliminate contracts
in response to the excess demand for, and supply of, contracts.
    For example, when traders want to buy more call contracts than are presently
available, they push the call contract prices up so that calls become overvalued relative
to the underlying stock. The arbitrageurs replicate calls by using a particular financial
engineering strategy to buy the underlying stock, and then create the desired call
option contracts by selling them short. In contrast, if more calls have been created
than traders want to hold, call prices will fall so that calls become undervalued relative
to the underlying stock. The arbitrageurs will trade stocks and contracts to absorb the
excess contracts. Arbitrageurs who use these strategies are financial intermediaries
because they connect buyers and sellers who want to trade the same underlying risks
but in different forms.

                               tics most clearly distinguish dealers from arbitrageurs?

                            Solution:
                               Dealers provide liquidity to buyers and sellers who arrive at the same market
                               at different times. They move liquidity through time. Arbitrageurs provide
                               liquidity to buyers and sellers who arrive at different markets at the same
                               time. They move liquidity across markets.

                                       describe types of financial intermediaries and services that they

                         Banks and investment companies create new financial products when they buy and
                         repackage securities or other assets. For example, mortgage banks commonly originate
                         hundreds or thousands of residential mortgages by lending money to homeowners.
                         They then place the mortgages in a pool and sell shares of the pool to investors as
                         mortgage pass-through securities, which are also known as mortgage-backed securi-
                         ties. All payments of principal and interest are passed through to the investors each
                         month, after deducting the costs of servicing the mortgages. Investors who purchase
                         these pass-through securities obtain securities that in aggregate have the same net
                         cash flows and associated risks as the pool of mortgages.
                             The process of buying assets, placing them in a pool, and then selling securities
                         that represent ownership of the pool is called securitization.
                             Mortgage-backed securities have the advantage that default losses and early
                         repayments are much more predictable for a diversified portfolio of mortgages than
                         they are for individual mortgages. They are also attractive to investors who cannot
                         efficiently service mortgages but wish to invest in mortgages. By securitizing mortgage
                         pools, the mortgage banks allow investors who are not large enough to buy hundreds
                         of mortgages to obtain the benefits of diversification and economies of scale in loan
                         servicing.
                             Securitization greatly improves liquidity in the mortgage markets because it allows
                         investors in the pass-through securities to buy mortgages indirectly that they otherwise
                         would not buy. Because the financial risks associated with mortgage-backed securities
                         (debt securities with specified claims on the cash flows of a portfolio of mortgages)
                         are much more predictable than those of individual mortgages, mortgage-backed
                         securities are easier to price and thus easier to sell when investors need to raise cash.
                         These characteristics make the market for mortgage-backed securities much more
                         liquid than the market for individual mortgages. Because investors value liquidity—the
                         ability to sell when they want to—they will pay more for securitized mortgages than
                         for individual mortgages. The homeowners benefit because higher mortgage prices
                         imply lower interest rates.

    The mortgage bank is a financial intermediary because it connects investors who
want to buy mortgages to homeowners who want to borrow money. The homeowners
sell mortgages to the bank when the bank lends them money.
    Some mortgage banks form mortgage pools from mortgages that they buy from
other banks that originate the loans. These mortgage banks are also financial inter-
mediaries because they connect sellers of mortgages to buyers of mortgage-backed
securities. Although the sellers of the mortgages are the originating lenders and not
the borrowers, the benefits of creating liquid mortgage-backed securities ultimately
flow back to the borrowers.
    The creation of the pass-through securities generally takes place on the accounts of
the mortgage bank. The bank buys mortgages and sells pass-through securities whose
values depend on the mortgage pool. The mortgages appear on the bank’s accounts
as assets and the mortgage-backed securities appear as liabilities.
    In many securitizations, the financial intermediary avoids placing the assets and
liabilities on its balance sheet by setting up a special corporation or trust that buys
the assets and issues the securities. That corporation or trust is called a special pur-
pose vehicle (SPV) or alternatively a special purpose entity (SPE). Conducting a
securitization through a special purpose vehicle is advantageous to investors because
their interests in the asset pool are better protected in an SPV than they would be
on the balance sheet of the financial intermediary if the financial intermediary were
to go bankrupt.
    Financial intermediaries securitize many assets. Besides mortgages, banks securitize
car loans, credit card receivables, bank loans, and airplane leases, to name just a few
assets. As a class, these securities are called asset-backed securities.
    When financial intermediaries securitize assets, they often create several classes
of securities, called tranches, that have different rights to the cash flows from the
asset pool. The tranches are structured so that some produce more predictable cash
flows than do others. The senior tranches have first rights to the cash flow from the
asset pool. Because the overall risk of a given asset pool cannot be changed, the more
junior tranches bear a disproportionate share of the risk of the pool. Practitioners
often call the most junior tranche toxic waste because it is so risky. The complexity
associated with slicing asset pools into tranches can make the resulting securities
difficult to value. Mistakes in valuing these securities contributed to the financial
crisis that started in 2007.
    Investment companies also create pass-through securities based on investment
pools. For example, an exchange-traded fund is an asset-backed security that represents
ownership in the securities and contracts held by the fund. The shareholders benefit
from the securitization because they can buy or sell an entire portfolio in a single
transaction. Because the transaction cost savings are quite substantial, exchange-traded
funds often trade in very liquid markets. The investment companies (and sometimes
the arbitrageurs) that create exchange-traded funds are financial intermediaries
because they connect the buyers of the funds to the sellers of the assets that make
up the fund portfolios.
    More generally, the creators of all pooled investment vehicles are financial inter-
mediaries that transform portfolios of securities and contracts into securities that
represent undivided ownership of the portfolios. The investors in these funds thus
indirectly invest in the securities held by the fund. They benefit from the expertise of
the investment manager and from obtaining a portfolio that may be more diversified
than one they might otherwise be able to hold.

                         Depository Institutions and Other Financial Corporations
                         Depository institutions include commercial banks, savings and loan banks, credit
                         unions, and similar institutions that raise funds from depositors and other investors
                         and lend it to borrowers. The banks give their depositors interest and transaction
                         services, such as check writing and check cashing, in exchange for using their money.
                         They may also raise funds by selling bonds or equity in the bank.
                              These banks are financial intermediaries because they transfer funds from their
                         depositors and investors to their borrowers. The depositors and investors benefit
                         because they obtain a return (in interest, transaction services, dividends, or capital
                         appreciation) on their funds without having to contract with the borrowers and
                         manage their loans. The borrowers benefit because they obtain the funds that they
                         need without having to search for investors who will trust them to repay their loans.
                              Many other financial corporations provide credit services. For example, acceptance
                         corporations, discount corporations, payday advance corporations, and factors pro-
                         vide credit to borrowers by lending them money secured by such assets as consumer
                         loans, machinery, future paychecks, or accounts receivables. They finance these loans
                         by selling commercial paper, bonds, and shares to investors. These corporations are
                         intermediaries because they connect investors to borrowers. The investors obtain
                         investments secured by a diversified portfolio of loans while the borrowers obtain
                         funds without having to search for investors.
                              Brokers also act as financial intermediaries when they lend funds to clients who
                         want to buy securities on margin. They generally obtain the funds from other clients
                         who deposit them in their accounts. Brokers who provide these services to hedge
                         funds and other similar institutions are called prime brokers.
                              Banks, financial corporations, and brokers can only raise money from depositors and
                         other lenders because their equity owners retain residual interests in the performance
                         of the loans that they make. If the borrowers default, the depositors and other lenders
                         have priority claims over the equity owners. If insufficient money is collected from
                         the borrowers, shareholders’ equity is used to pay their depositors and other lenders.
                         The risk of losing capital focuses the equity owners’ and management’s attention so
                         that credit is not offered foolishly.
                              Because the ability of these companies to cover their credit losses is limited by the
                         capital that their owners invest in them, the depositors and other investors who lend
                         them money pay close attention to how much money the owners have at risk. For
                         example, if a finance corporation is poorly capitalized, its shareholders will lose little
                         if its clients default on the loans that the finance corporation makes to them. In that
                         case, the finance corporation will have little incentive to lend only to creditworthy
                         borrowers and to effectively manage collection on those loans once they have been
                         made. Worse, it may even choose to lend to borrowers with poor credit because the
                         interest rates that they can charge such borrowers are higher. Until those loans default,
                         the higher income will make the corporation appear to be more profitable than it actu-
                         ally is. Depositors and other investors are aware of these problems and generally pay
                         close attention to them. Accordingly, poorly capitalized financial institutions cannot
                         easily borrow money to finance their operations at favorable rates.
                              Depository banks and financial corporations are similar to securitized asset pools
                         that issue pass-through securities. Their depositors and investors own securities
                         that ultimately are backed by an asset pool consisting of their loan portfolios. The
                         depositors generally hold the most senior tranche, followed by the other creditors.
                         The shareholders hold the most junior tranche. In the event of bankruptcy, they are
                         paid only if everyone else is paid.

   1. What services do commercial banks provide that make them financial
      intermediaries?

   Solution:
      Commercial banks collect deposits from investors and lend them to bor-
      rowers. They are intermediaries because they connect lenders to borrowers.
      Commercial banks also provide transaction services that make it easier for
      the banks’ depository customers to pay bills and collect funds from their

Insurance companies help people and companies offset risks that concern them. They
do this by creating insurance contracts (policies) that provide a payment in the event
that some loss occurs. The insured buy these contracts to hedge against potential losses.
Common examples of insurance contracts include auto, fire, life, liability, medical,
theft, and disaster insurance contracts.
    Credit default swaps are also insurance contracts, but historically they have not
been subject to the same reserve requirements that most governments apply to more
traditional insurance contracts. They may be sold by insurance companies or by other
financial entities, such as investment banks or hedge funds.
    Insurance contracts transfer risk from those who buy the contracts to those who sell
them. Although insurance companies occasionally broker trades between the insured
and the insurer, they more commonly provide the insurance themselves. In that case,
the insurance company’s owners and creditors become the indirect insurers of the
risks that the insurance company assumes. Insurance companies also often transfer
risks that they do not wish to bear by buying reinsurance policies from reinsurers.
    Insurers are financial intermediaries because they connect the buyers of their
insurance contracts with investors, creditors, and reinsurers who are willing to bear the
insured risks. The buyers benefit because they can easily obtain the risk transfers that
they seek without searching for entities that would be willing to assume those risks.
    The owners, creditors, and reinsurers of the insurance company benefit because
the company allows them to sell their tolerance for risk easily without having to
manage the insurance contracts. Instead, the company manages the relationships with
the insured—primarily collections and claims—and hopefully controls the various
problems—fraud, moral hazard, and adverse selection—that often plague insurance
markets. Fraud occurs when people deliberately cause or falsely report losses to col-
lect on insurance. Moral hazard occurs when people are less careful about avoiding
insured losses than they would be if they were not insured so that losses occur more
often than they would otherwise. Adverse selection occurs when only those who are
most at risk buy insurance so that insured losses tend to be greater than average.
    Everyone benefits because insurance companies hold large diversified portfolios
of policies. Loss rates for well-diversified portfolios of insurance contracts are much
more predictable than for single contracts. For such contracts as auto insurance in
which losses are almost uncorrelated across policies, diversification ensures that the
financial performance of a large portfolio of contracts will be quite predictable and so
holding the portfolio will not be very risky. The insured benefit because they do not
have to pay the insurers much to compensate them for bearing risk (the expected loss

                         is quite predictable so the risk is relatively low). Instead, their insurance premiums
                         primarily reflect the expected loss rate in the portfolio plus the costs of running and
                         financing the company.




             9           SETTLEMENT AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES AND
                         SUMMARY

                                       describe types of financial intermediaries and services that they
                                       provide

                         In addition to connecting buyers to sellers through a variety of direct and indirect
                         means, financial intermediaries also help their customers settle their trades and ensure
                         that the resulting positions are not stolen or pledged more than once as collateral.
                             Clearinghouses arrange for final settlement of trades. In futures markets, they
                         guarantee contract performance. In other markets, they may act only as escrow agents,
                         transferring money from the buyer to the seller while transferring securities from the
                         seller to the buyer.
                             The members of a clearinghouse are the only traders for whom the clearinghouse
                         will settle trades. To ensure that their members settle the trades that they present to
                         the clearinghouse, clearinghouses require that their members have adequate capital
                         and post-performance bonds (margins). Clearinghouses also limit the aggregate net
                         (buy minus sell) quantities that their members can settle.
                             Brokers and dealers who are not members of the clearinghouse must arrange to
                         have a clearinghouse member settle their trades. To ensure that the non-member
                         brokers and dealers can settle their trades, clearinghouse members require that
                         their customers (the non-member brokers and dealers) have adequate capital and
                         post-margins. They also limit the aggregate net quantities that their customers can
                         settle and they monitor their customers’ trading to ensure that they do not arrange
                         trades that they cannot settle.
                             Brokers and dealers similarly monitor the trades made by their retail and insti-
                         tutional customers, and regulate their customers to ensure that they do not arrange
                         trades that they cannot settle.
                             This hierarchical system of responsibility generally ensures that traders settle
                         their trades. The brokers and dealers guarantee settlement of the trades they arrange
                         for their retail and institutional customers. The clearinghouse members guarantee
                         settlement of the trades that their customers present to them, and clearinghouses
                         guarantee settlement of all trades presented to them by their members. If a clearing-
                         house member fails to settle a trade, the clearinghouse settles the trade using its own
                         capital or capital drafted from the other members.
                             Reliable settlement of all trades is extremely important to a well-functioning finan-
                         cial system because it allows strangers to confidently contract with each other without
                         worrying too much about counterparty risk, the risk that their counterparties will
                         not settle their trades. A secure clearinghouse system thus greatly increases liquidity
                         because it greatly increases the number of counterparties with whom a trader can
                         safely arrange a trade.
                             In many national markets, clearinghouses clear all securities trades so that trad-
                         ers can trade securities through any exchange, broker, alternative trading system, or
                         dealer. These clearinghouse systems promote competition among these exchange
                         service providers.

    In contrast, most futures exchanges have their own clearinghouses. These clear-
inghouses usually will not accept trades arranged away from their exchanges so that a
competing exchange cannot trade another exchange’s contracts. Competing exchanges
may create similar contracts, but moving traders from one established market to a
new market is extraordinarily difficult because traders prefer to trade where other
traders trade.
    Depositories or custodians hold securities on behalf of their clients. These services,
which are often offered by banks, help prevent the loss of securities through fraud,
oversight, or natural disaster. Broker–dealers also often hold securities on behalf of
their customers so that the customers do not have to hold the securities in certificate
form. To avoid problems with lost certificates, securities increasingly are issued only
in electronic form.

EXAMPLE 17

   Financial Intermediaries

   1. As a relatively new member of the business community, you decide it would
      be advantageous to join the local lunch club to network with businessmen.
      Upon learning that you are a financial analyst, club members soon enlist you
      to give a lunch speech. During the question and answer session afterwards,
      a member of the audience asks, “I keep reading in the newspaper about the
      need to regulate ‘financial intermediaries’, but really don’t understand exact-
      ly what they are. Can you tell me?” How do you answer?

   Solution:
      Financial intermediaries are companies that help their clients achieve their
      financial goals. They are called intermediaries because, in some way or
      another, they stand between two or more people who would like to trade
      with each other, but for various reasons find it difficult to do so directly. The
      intermediary arranges the trade for them, or more often, trades with both
      sides.
      For example, a commercial bank is an intermediary that connects investors
      with money to borrowers who need money. The investors buy certificates
      of deposit from the bank, buy bonds or stock issued by the bank, or simply
      are depositors in the bank. The borrowers borrow this money from the bank
      when they arrange loans. Without the bank’s intermediation, the investors
      would have to find trustworthy borrowers themselves, which would be dif-
      ficult, and the borrowers would have to find trusting lenders, which would
      also be difficult.
      Similarly, an insurance company is an intermediary because it connects
      customers who want to insure risks with investors who are willing to bear
      those risks. The investors own shares or bonds issued by the insurance
      company, or they have sold reinsurance contracts to the insurance compa-
      ny. The insured benefit because they can more easily buy a policy from an
      insurance company than they can find counterparties who would be willing
      to bear their risks. The investors benefit because the insurance company
      creates a diversified portfolio of risks by selling insurance to thousands or
      millions of customers. Diversification ensures that the net risk borne by the
      insurance company and its investors will be predictable and thus financially
      manageable.
      In both cases, the financial intermediary also manages the relationships
      with its customers and investors so that neither side has to worry about the
38   Learning Module 1                                                         Market Organization and Structure


                              credit-worthiness or trust-worthiness of its counterparties. For example,
                              the bank manages credit quality and collections on its loans and the insur-
                              ance company manages risk exposure and collections on its policies. These
                              services benefit both sides by reducing the costs of connecting investors to
                              borrowers or of insured to insurers.
                              These are only two examples of financial intermediation. Many others in-
                              volve firms engaged in brokerage, dealing, arbitrage, securitization, invest-
                              ment management, and the clearing and settlement of trades. In all cases,
                              the financial intermediary stands between a buyer and a seller, offering them
                              services that allow them to better achieve their financial goals in a cost effec-
                              tive and efficient manner.



                         Summary
                         By facilitating transactions among buyers and sellers, financial intermediaries provide
                         services essential to a well-functioning financial system. They facilitate transactions
                         the following ways:
                            1. Brokers, exchanges, and various alternative trading systems match buyers
                               and sellers interested in trading the same instrument at the same place and
                               time. These financial intermediaries specialize in discovering and organizing
                               information about who wants to trade.
                            2. Dealers and arbitrageurs connect buyers to sellers interested in trading
                               the same instrument but who are not present at the same place and time.
                               Dealers connect buyers to sellers who are present at the same place but
                               at different times whereas arbitrageurs connect buyers to sellers who are
                               present at the same time but in different places. These financial intermediar-
                               ies trade for their own accounts when providing these services. Dealers buy
                               or sell with one client and hope to do the offsetting transaction later with
                               another client. Arbitrageurs buy from a seller in one market while simulta-
                               neously selling to a buyer in another market.
                            3. Many financial intermediaries create new instruments that depend on
                               the cash flows and associated financial risks of other instruments. The
                               intermediaries provide these services when they securitize assets, manage
                               investment funds, operate banks and other finance corporations that offer
                               investments to investors and loans to borrowers, and operate insurance
                               companies that pool risks. The instruments that they create generally are
                               more attractive to their clients than the instruments on which they are
                               based. The new instruments also may be differentiated to appeal to diverse
                               clienteles. Their efforts connect buyers of one or more instruments to sellers
                               of other instruments, all of which in aggregate provide the same cash flows
                               and risk exposures. Financial intermediaries thus effectively arrange trades
                               among traders who otherwise would not trade with each other.
                            4. Arbitrageurs who conduct arbitrage among securities and contracts whose
                               values depend on common factors convert risk from one form to another.
                               Their trading connects buyers and sellers who want to trade similar risks
                               expressed in different forms.
                            5. Banks, clearinghouses, and depositories provide services that ensure traders
                               settle their trades and that the resulting positions are not stolen or pledged
                               more than once as collateral.
Positions and Short Positions                                                                       39

              compare positions an investor can take in an asset

People generally solve their financial and risk management problems by taking positions
in various assets or contracts. A position in an asset is the quantity of the instrument
that an entity owns or owes. A portfolio consists of a set of positions.
    People have long positions when they own assets or contracts. Examples of long
positions include ownership of stocks, bonds, currencies, contracts, commodities,
or real assets. Long positions benefit from an appreciation in the prices of the assets
or contracts owned.
    People have short positions when they have sold assets that they do not own,
or when they write and sell contracts. Short positions benefit from a decrease in the
prices of the assets or contracts sold. Short sellers profit by selling at high prices and
repurchasing at lower prices. Information-motivated traders sell assets and contracts
short positions when they believe that prices will fall.
    Hedgers also often sell instruments short. They short securities and contracts when
the financial risks inherent in the instruments are positively correlated with the risks
to which they are exposed. For example, to hedge the risk associated with holding
copper inventories, a wire manufacturer would sell short copper futures. If the price
of copper falls, the manufacturer will lose on his copper inventories but gain on his
short futures position. (If the risk in an instrument is inversely correlated with a risk
to which hedgers are exposed, the hedgers will hedge with long positions.)
    Contracts have long sides and short sides. The long side of a forward or futures
contract is the side that will take physical delivery or its cash equivalent. The short side
of such contracts is the side that is liable for the delivery. The long side of a futures
contract increases in value when the value of the underlying asset increases in value.
    The identification of the two sides can be confusing for option contracts. The
long side of an option contract is the side that holds the right to exercise the option.
The short side is the side that must satisfy the obligation. Practitioners say that that
the long side holds the option and the short side writes the option, so the long side
is the holder and the short side is the writer. The put contracts are the source of the
potential confusion. The put contract holder has the right to sell the underlying to
the writer. The holder will benefit if the price of the underlying falls, in which case
the price of the put contract will rise. The holder is long the put contract and has
an indirect short position in the underlying instrument. Analysts call the indirect
short position short exposure to the underlying. The put contract holders have long
exposure to their option contract and short exposure to the underlying instrument.

                         The identification of the long side in a swap contract is often arbitrary because swap
                         contracts call for the exchange of contractually determined cash flows rather than for
                         the purchase (or the cash equivalent) of some underlying instrument. In general, the
                         side that benefits from an increase in the quoted price is the long side.
                             The identification of the long side in currency contracts also may be confusing.
                         In this case, the confusion stems from symmetry in the contracts. The buyer of one
                         currency is the seller of the other currency, and vice versa for the seller. Thus, a long
                         forward position in one currency is a short forward position in the other currency.
                         When practitioners describe a position, they generally will say, “I’m long the dollar
                         against the yen,” which means they have bought dollars and sold yen.


                         Short Positions
                         Short sellers create short positions in contracts by selling contracts that they do not
                         own. In a sense, they become the issuers of the contract when they create the liabilities
                         associated with their contracts. This analogy will also help you better understand risk
                         when you study corporate finance: Corporations create short positions in their bonds
                         when they issue bonds in exchange for cash. Although bonds are generally considered
                         to be securities, they are also contracts between the issuer and the bondholder.
                             Short sellers create short positions in securities by borrowing securities from secu-
                         rity lenders who are long holders. The short sellers then sell the borrowed securities
                         to other traders. Short sellers close their positions by repurchasing the securities and
                         returning them to the security lenders. If the securities drop in value, the short sellers
                         profit because they repurchase the securities at lower prices than the prices at which
                         they sold the securities. If the securities rise in value, they will lose. Short sellers who
                         buy to close their positions are said to cover their positions.
                             The potential gains in a long position generally are unbounded. For example, the
                         stock prices of such highly successful companies as Yahoo! have increased more than
                         50-fold since they were first publicly traded. The potential losses on long positions,
                         however, are limited to no more than 100 percent—a complete loss—for long positions
                         without any associated liabilities.
                             In contrast, the potential gains on a short position are limited to no more than
                         100 percent whereas the potential losses are unbounded. The unbounded potential
                         losses on short positions make short positions very risky in volatile instruments. As
                         an extreme example of this, if you had shorted 100 shares of Yahoo! in July 1996 at
                         $20 and kept the position open for four years, you would have lost $148,000 on your
                         $2,000 initial short position. During this period, Yahoo! rose 75-fold to $1,500 on a
                         split-adjusted equivalent basis.
                             Although security lenders generally believe that they are long the securities that
                         they lend, in fact, they do not actually own the securities during the periods of their
                         loans. Instead, they own promises made by the short sellers to return the securities.
                         These promises are memorialized in security lending agreements. These agreements
                         specify that the short sellers will pay the long sellers all dividends or interest that they
                         otherwise would have received had they not lent their securities. These payments are
                         called payments-in-lieu of dividends (or of interest), and they may have different tax
                         treatments than actual dividends and interest. The security lending agreements also
                         protect the lenders in the event of a stock split.
                             To secure the security loans, lenders require that the short seller leave the proceeds
                         of the short sale on deposit with them as collateral for the stock loan. They invest the
                         collateral in short-term securities, and they rebate the interest to the short sellers at
                         rates called short rebate rates. The short rebate rates are determined in the market and
                         generally are available only to institutional short-sellers and some large retail traders.
                         If a security is hard to borrow, the rebate rate may be very small or even negative.
Leveraged Positions                                                                             41


Such securities are said to be “on special”. Most security lending agreements require
various margin payments to keep the credit risk among the parties from growing
when prices change.
    Securities lenders lend their securities because the short rebate rates they pay on
the collateral are lower than the interest rates they receive from investing the col-
lateral. The difference is because of the implicit loan fees that they receive from the
borrowers for borrowing the stock. The difference also compensates lenders for risks
that the lenders take when investing the collateral and for the risk that the borrowers
will default if prices rise significantly.

  Short Positions in Securities and Contracts

  1. How is the process of short selling shares of Siemens different from that of
     short selling a Siemens equity call option contract?

  Solution:
     To short sell shares of Siemens, the seller (or his broker) must borrow the
     shares from a long holder so that he can deliver them to the buyer. To short
     sell a Siemens equity call option contract, the seller simply creates the con-
     tract when he sells it to the buyer.

              calculate and interpret the leverage ratio, the rate of return on a
              margin transaction, and the security price at which the investor
              would receive a margin call

In many markets, traders can buy securities by borrowing some of the purchase price.
They usually borrow the money from their brokers. The borrowed money is called the
margin loan, and they are said to buy on margin. The interest rate that the buyers pay
for their margin loan is called the call money rate. The call money rate is above the
government bill rate and is negotiable. Large buyers generally obtain more favorable
rates than do retail buyers. For institutional-size buyers, the call money rate is quite
low because the loans are generally well secured by securities held as collateral by
the lender.
    Trader’s equity is that portion of the security price that the buyer must supply.
Traders who buy securities on margin are subject to minimum margin requirements.
The initial margin requirement is the minimum fraction of the purchase price that
must be trader’s equity. This requirement may be set by the government, the exchange,
or the exchange clearinghouse. For example, in the United States, the Federal Reserve
Board sets the initial margin requirement through Regulation T. In Hong Kong SAR,
the Securities and Futures Commission sets the margin requirements. In all markets,
brokers often require more equity than the government-required minimum from their
clients when lending to them.
    Many markets allow brokers to lend their clients more money if the brokers use
risk models to measure and control the overall risk of their clients’ portfolios. This
system is called portfolio margining.

                             Buying securities on margin can greatly increase the potential gains or losses for
                         a given amount of equity in a position because the trader can buy more securities on
                         margin than he could otherwise. The buyer thus earns greater profits when prices rise
                         and suffers greater losses when prices fall. The relation between risk and borrowing
                         is called financial leverage (often simply called leverage). Traders leverage their
                         positions when they borrow to buy more securities. A highly leveraged position is
                         large relative to the equity that supports it.
                             The leverage ratio is the ratio of the value of the position to the value of the equity
                         investment in it. The leverage ratio indicates how many times larger a position is than
                         the equity that supports it. The maximum leverage ratio associated with a position
                         financed by the minimum margin requirement is one divided by the minimum margin
                         requirement. If the requirement is 40 percent, then the maximum leverage ratio is
                         2.5 = 100% position ÷ 40% equity.
                             The leverage ratio indicates how much more risky a leveraged position is relative
                         to an unleveraged position. For example, if a stock bought on 40 percent margin rises
                         10 percent, the buyer will experience a 25 percent (2.5 × 10%) return on the equity
                         investment in her leveraged position. But if the stock falls by 10 percent, the return
                         on the equity investment will be −25 percent (before the interest on the margin loan
                         and before payment of commissions).
                             Financial analysts must be able to compute the total return to the equity invest-
                         ment in a leveraged position. The total return depends on the price change of the
                         purchased security, the dividends or interest paid by the security, the interest paid on
                         the margin loan, and the commissions paid to buy and sell the security. The following
                         example illustrates the computation of the total return to a leveraged purchase of
                         stock that pays a dividend.

                            Computing Total Return to a Leveraged Stock Purchase
                            A buyer buys stock on margin and holds the position for exactly one year, during
                            which time the stock pays a dividend. For simplicity, assume that the interest on
                            the loan and the dividend are both paid at the end of the year.
                                                                      ​

                            1. What is the total return on this investment?

                            Solution to 1:
                               To find the return on this investment, first determine the initial equity and
                               then determine the equity remaining after the sale. The total purchase price
                               is $20,000. The leverage ratio of 2.5 indicates that the buyer’s equity financed
                               40 percent = (1 ÷ 2.5) of the purchase price. Thus, the equity investment is
                               $8,000 = 40% of $20,000. The $12,000 remainder is borrowed. The actual in-
                               vestment is slightly higher because the buyer must pay a commission of $10
Leveraged Positions                                                                      43


     = $0.01/share × 1,000 shares to buy the stock. The total initial investment is
     $8,010.
     At the end of the year, the stock price has declined by $5/share. The buy-
     er lost $5,000 = $5/share × 1,000 shares as a result of the price change. In
     addition, the buyer has to pay interest at 5 percent on the $12,000 loan, or
     $600. The buyer also receives a dividend of $0.10/share, or $100. The trader’s
     equity remaining after the sale is computed from the initial equity invest-
     ment as follows:
                                           ​

          Proceeds on sale                                         $15,000
          Payoff loan                                              –12,000
          Margin interest paid                                        –600
          Dividends received                                           100
          Sales commission paid                                        –10
          Remaining equity                                          $2,490
                                           ​




     so that the return on the initial investment of $8,010 is (2,490 – 8,010)/8,010
     = –68.9%.

  2. Why is the loss greater than the 25 percent decrease in the market price?

  Solution to 2:
     The realized loss is substantially greater than the stock price return of ($15 –
     $20)/$20 = –25%. Most of the difference is because of the leverage with the
     remainder primarily the result of the interest paid on the loan. Based on the
     leverage alone and ignoring the other cash flows, we would expect that the
     return on the equity would be –62.5% = 2.5 leverage times the –25% stock
     price return.

    In the above example, if the stock dropped more than the buyer’s original 40
percent margin (ignoring commissions, interest, and dividends), the trader’s equity
would have become negative. In that case, the investor would owe his broker more
than the stock is worth. Brokers often lose money in such situations if the buyer does
not repay the loan out of other funds.
    To prevent such losses, brokers require that margin buyers always have a mini-
mum amount of equity in their positions. This minimum is called the maintenance
margin requirement. It is usually 25 percent of the current value of the position,
but it may be higher or lower depending on the volatility of the instrument and the
policies of the broker.
44   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                             If the value of the equity falls below the maintenance margin requirement, the
                         buyer will receive a margin call, or request for additional equity. If the buyer does not
                         deposit additional equity with the broker in a timely manner, the broker will close the
                         position to prevent further losses and thereby secure repayment of the margin loan.
                             When you buy securities on margin, you must know the price at which you will
                         receive a margin call if prices drop. The answer to this question depends on your
                         initial equity and on the maintenance margin requirement.

                         EXAMPLE 20

                            Margin Call Price

                            1. A trader buys stock on margin posting 40 percent of the initial stock price
                               of $20 as equity. The maintenance margin requirement for the position is 25
                               percent. Below what price will a margin call occur?

                            Solution:
                               The trader’s initial equity is 40 percent of the initial stock price of $20, or
                               $8 per share. Subsequent changes in equity per share are equal to the share
                               price change so that equity per share is equal to $8 + (P – 20) where P is the
                               current share price. The margin call takes place when equity drops below
                               the 25 percent maintenance margin requirement. The price below which a
                               margin call will take place is the solution to the following equation:

                               _ Equity/share     $8 + P − 20
                               	​ Price/share ​ = _
                                                  ​    P      ​ = 25%​

                               which occurs at P = 16. When the price drops below $16, the equity will be
                               under $4/share, which is less than 25 percent of the price.

                             Traders who sell securities short are also subject to margin requirements because
                         they have borrowed securities. Initially, the trader’s equity supporting the short posi-
                         tion must be at least equal to the margin requirement times the initial value of the
                         short position. If prices rise, equity will be lost. At some point, the short seller will
                         have to contribute additional equity to meet the maintenance margin requirement.
                         Otherwise, the broker will buy the security back to cover the short position to prevent
                         further losses and thereby secure repayment of the stock loan.

to buy from, or sell to, other traders seeking to sell or buy. The prices at which they
are willing to buy are called bid prices and those at which they are willing to sell are
called ask prices, or sometimes offer prices. The ask prices are invariably higher than
the bid prices.
     The traders who are willing to trade at various prices may also indicate the quan-
tities that they will trade at those prices. These quantities are called bid sizes and ask
sizes depending on whether they are attached to bids or offers.
     Practitioners say that the traders who offer to trade make a market. Those who
trade with them take the market.
     The highest bid in the market is the best bid, and the lowest ask in the market is
the best offer. The difference between the best bid and the best offer is the market
bid–ask spread. When traders ask, “What’s the market?” they want to know the best
bid and ask prices and their associated sizes. Bid–ask spreads are an implicit cost of
trading. Markets with small bid–ask spreads are markets in which the costs of trading
are small, at least for the sizes quoted. Dealers often quote both bid and ask prices,
and in that case, practitioners say that they quote a two-sided market. The market
spread is never more than any dealer spread.


Execution Instructions
Market and limit orders convey the most common execution instructions. A market
order instructs the broker or exchange to obtain the best price immediately available
when filling the order. A limit order conveys almost the same instruction: Obtain the
best price immediately available, but in no event accept a price higher than a specified
limit price when buying or accept a price lower than a specified limit price when selling.
    Many people mistakenly believe that limit orders specify the prices at which the
orders will trade. Although limit orders do often trade at their limit prices, remember
that the first instruction is to obtain the best price available. If better prices are available
than the limit price, brokers and exchanges should obtain those prices for their clients.
    Market orders generally execute immediately if other traders are willing to take
the other side of the trade. The main drawback with market orders is that they can
be expensive to execute, especially when the order is placed in a market for a thinly
traded security, or more generally, when the order is large relative to the normal trad-
ing activity in the market. In that case, a market buy order may fill at a high price, or
a market sell order may fill at a low price if no traders are willing to trade at better
prices. High purchase prices and low sale prices represent price concessions given
to other traders to encourage them to take the other side of the trade. Because the
sizes of price concessions can be difficult to predict, and because prices often change
between when a trader submits an order and when the order finally fills, the execution
prices for market orders are often uncertain.
    Buyers and sellers who are concerned about the possibility of trading at unaccept-
able prices add limit price instructions to their orders. The main problem with limit
orders is that they may not execute. Limit orders do not execute if the limit price on
a buy order is too low, or if the limit price on a sell order is too high. For example, if
an investment manager submits a limit order to buy at the limit price of 20 (buy limit
20) and nobody is willing to sell at or below 20, the order will not trade. If prices never
drop to 20, the manager will never buy. If the price subsequently rises, the manager
will have lost the opportunity to profit from the price rise.

                              Whether traders use market orders or limit orders when trying to arrange trades
                         depends on their concerns about price, trading quickly, and failing to trade. On average,
                         limit orders trade at better prices than do market orders, but they often do not trade.
                         Traders generally regret when their limit orders fail to trade because they usually
                         would have profited if they had traded. Limit buy orders do not fill when prices are
                         rising, and limit sell orders do not fill when prices are falling. In both cases, traders
                         would be better off if their orders had filled.
                              The probability that a limit order will execute depends on where the order is placed
                         relative to market prices. An aggressively priced order is more likely to trade than is a
                         less aggressively priced order. A limit buy order is aggressively priced when the limit
                         price is high relative to the market bid and ask prices. If the limit price is placed above
                         the best offer, the buy order generally will partially or completely fill at the best offer
                         price, depending on the size available at the best offer. Such limit orders are called
                         marketable limit orders because at least part of the order can trade immediately. A
                         limit buy order with a very high price relative to the market is essentially a market order.
                              If the buy order is placed above the best bid but below the best offer, traders say the
                         order makes a new market because it becomes the new best bid. Such orders generally
                         will not immediately trade, but they may attract sellers who are interested in trading.
                         A buy order placed at the best bid is said to make market. It may have to wait until
                         all other buy orders at that price trade first. Finally, a buy order placed below the best
                         bid is behind the market. It will not execute unless market prices drop. Traders call
                         limit orders that are waiting to trade standing limit orders.
                              Sell limit orders are aggressively priced if the limit price is low relative to market
                         prices. The limit price of a marketable sell limit order is below the best bid. A limit
                         sell order placed between the best bid and the best offer makes a new market on the
                         sell side, one placed at the best offer makes market, and one placed above the best
                         offer is behind the market.
                              Exhibit 2 presents a simplified limit order book in which orders are presented
                         ranked by their limit prices for a hypothetical market. The market is “26 bid, offered
                         at 28” because the best bid is 26 and the best offer (ask) is 28.

EXAMPLE 21

   Making and Taking

   1. What is the difference between making a market and taking a market?

   Solution to 1:
      A trader makes a market when the trader offers to trade. A trader takes a
      market when the trader accepts an offer to trade.

   2. What order types are most likely associated with making a market and tak-
      ing a market?

   Solution to 2:
      Traders place standing limit orders to give other traders opportunities to
      trade. Standing limit orders thus make markets. In contrast, traders use
      market orders or marketable limit orders to take offers to trade. These mar-
      ketable orders take the market.

                             A trade-off exists between how aggressively priced an order is and the ultimate
                         trade price. Although aggressively priced orders fill faster and with more certainty then
                         do less aggressively priced limit orders, the prices at which they execute are inferior.
                         Buyers seeking to trade quickly must pay higher prices to increase the probability of
                         trading quickly. Similarly, sellers seeking to trade quickly must accept lower prices to
                         increase the probability of trading quickly.
                             Some order execution instructions specify conditions on size. For example,
                         all-or-nothing (AON) orders can only trade if their entire sizes can be traded. Traders
                         can similarly specify minimum fill sizes. This specification is common when settlement
                         costs depend on the number of trades made to fill an order and not on the aggregate
                         size of the order.
                             Exposure instructions indicate whether, how, and perhaps to whom orders should
                         be exposed. Hidden orders are exposed only to the brokers or exchanges that receive
                         them. These agencies cannot disclose hidden orders to other traders until they can fill
                         them. Traders use hidden orders when they are afraid that other traders might behave
                         strategically if they knew that a large order was in the market. Traders can discover
                         hidden size only by submitting orders that will trade with that size. Thus, traders can
                         only learn about hidden size after they have committed to trading with it.
                             Traders also often indicate a specific display size for their orders. Brokers and
                         exchanges then expose only the display size for these orders. Any additional size is
                         hidden from the public but can be filled if a suitably large order arrives. Traders some-
                         times call such orders iceberg orders because most of the order is hidden. Traders
                         specify display sizes when they do not want to display their full sizes, but still want
                         other traders to know that someone is willing to trade at the displayed price. Traders
                         on the opposite side who wish to trade additional size at that price can discover the
                         hidden size only if they trade the displayed size, at which point the broker or exchange
                         will display any remaining size up to the display size. They also can discover the hidden
                         size by submitting large orders that will trade with that size.

                            Market versus Limit and Hidden versus Displayed Orders
                            You are the buy-side trader for a very clever investment manager. The manager
                            has hired a commercial satellite firm to take regular pictures of the parking lots
                            in which new car dealers store their inventories. It has also hired some part-time
                            workers to count the cars on the lots. With this information and some econo-
                            metric analyses, the manager can predict weekly new car sale announcements
                            more accurately than can most analysts. The manager typically makes a quarter
                            percent each week on this strategy. Once a week, a day before the announcements
                            are made, the manager gives you large orders to buy or sell car manufacturers
                            based on his insights into their dealers’ sales. What primary issues should you
                            consider when deciding whether to:

                            1. use market or limit orders to fill his orders?

                            Solution to 1:
                               The manager’s information is quite perishable. If his orders are not filled
                               before the weekly sales are reported to the public, the manager will lose the
                               opportunity to profit from the information as prices immediately adjust to
                               the news. The manager, therefore, needs to get the orders filled quickly. This
                               consideration suggests that the orders should be submitted as market or-
Validity Instructions and Clearing Instructions                                                   49


      ders. If submitted as limit orders, the orders might not execute and the firm
      would lose the opportunity to profit.
      Large market orders, however, can be very expensive to execute, especially
      if few people are willing to trade significant size on the other side of the
      market. Because transaction costs can easily exceed the expected quarter
      percent return, you should submit limit orders to limit the execution prices
      that you are willing to accept. It is better to fail to trade than to trade at
      losing prices.

   2. display the orders or hide them?

   Solution to 2:
      Your large orders could easily move the market if many people were aware
      of them, and even more so if others were aware that you are trading on be-
      half of a successful information-motivated trader. You thus should consider
      submitting hidden orders. The disadvantage of hidden orders is that they do
      not let people know that they can trade the other side if they want to.




VALIDITY INSTRUCTIONS AND CLEARING
INSTRUCTIONS                                                                                 13
               compare execution, validity, and clearing instructions

Validity instructions indicate when an order may be filled. The most common validity
instruction is the day order. A day order is good for the day on which it is submitted.
If it has not been filled by the close of business, the order expires unfilled.
     Good-till-cancelled orders (GTC) are just that. In practice, most brokers limit
how long they will manage an order to ensure that they do not fill orders that their
clients have forgotten. Such brokers may limit their GTC orders to a few months.
     Immediate or cancel orders (IOC) are good only upon receipt by the broker or
exchange. If they cannot be filled in part or in whole, they cancel immediately. In
some markets these orders are also known as fill or kill orders. When searching for
hidden liquidity, electronic algorithmic trading systems often submit thousands of
these IOC orders for every order that they fill.
     Good-on-close orders can only be filled at the close of trading. These orders often
are market orders, so traders call them market-on-close orders. Traders often use
on-close orders when they want to trade at the same prices that will be published as the
closing prices of the day. Mutual funds often like to trade at such prices because they
value their portfolios at closing prices. Many traders also use good-on-open orders.


Stop Orders
A stop order is an order in which a trader has specified a stop price condition. The
stop order may not be filled until the stop price condition has been satisfied. For a sell
order, the stop price condition suspends execution of the order until a trade occurs at
or below the stop price. After that trade, the stop condition is satisfied and the order
becomes valid for execution, subject to all other execution instructions attached to
50   Learning Module 1                                                           Market Organization and Structure


                         it. If the market price subsequently rises above the sell order’s stop price before the
                         order trades, the order remains valid. Similarly, a buy order with a stop condition
                         becomes valid only after a price rises above the specified stop price.
                              Traders often call stop orders stop-loss orders because many traders use them
                         with the hope of stopping losses on positions that they have established. For example,
                         a trader who has bought stock at 40 may want to sell the stock if the price falls below
                         30. In that case, the trader might submit a “GTC, stop 30, market sell” order. If the
                         price falls to or below 30, the market order becomes valid and it should immediately
                         execute at the best price then available in the market. That price may be substantially
                         lower than 30 if the market is falling quickly. The stop-loss order thus does not guar-
                         antee a stop to losses at the stop price. If potential sellers are worried about trading at
                         too low of a price, they can attach stop instructions to limit orders instead of market
                         orders. In this example, if the trader is unwilling to sell below 25, the trader would
                         submit a “GTC, stop 30, limit 25 sell” order.
                              If a trader wants to guarantee that he can sell at 30, the trader would buy a put
                         option contract struck at 30. The purchase price of the option would include a premium
                         for the insurance that the trader is buying. Option contracts can be viewed as limit
                         orders for which execution is guaranteed at the strike price. A trader similarly might
                         use a stop-buy order or a call option to limit losses on a short position.
                              A portfolio manager might use a stop-buy order when the manager believes that
                         a security is undervalued but is unwilling to trade without market confirmation. For
                         example, suppose that a stock currently trades for 50 RMB and a manager believes
                         that it should be worth 100 RMB. Further, the manager believes that the stock will
                         much more likely be worth 100 RMB if other traders are willing to buy it above 65
                         RMB. To best take advantage of this information, the manager would consider issuing
                         a “GTC, stop 65 RMB, limit 100 RMB buy” order. Note that if the manager relies too
                         much on the market when making this trading decision, however, he may violate CFA
                         Standard of Professional Conduct V.A.2, which requires that all investment actions have
                         a reasonable and adequate basis supported by appropriate research and investigation.
                              Because stop-sell orders become valid when prices are falling and stop-buy orders
                         become valid when prices are rising, traders using stop orders contribute to market
                         momentum as their sell orders push prices down further and their buy orders push
                         prices up. Execution prices for stop orders thus are often quite poor.

                            Limit and Stop Instructions

                            1. In what ways do limit and stop instructions differ?

                            Solution:
                               Although both limit and stop instructions specify prices, the role that these
                               prices play in the arrangement of a trade are completely different. A limit
                               price places a limit on what trade prices will be acceptable to the trader. A
                               buyer will accept prices only at or lower than the limit price whereas a seller
                               will accept prices only at or above the limit price.
                               In contrast, a stop price indicates when an order can be filled. A buy order
                               can only be filled once the market has traded at a price at or above the stop
                               price. A sell order can only be filled once the market has traded at a price at
                               or below the stop price.
                               Both order instructions may delay or prevent the execution of an order. A
                               buy limit order will not execute until someone is willing to sell at or below
                               the limit price. Similarly, a sell limit order will not execute until someone is
Primary Security Markets                                                                         51


      willing to buy at or above the limit sell price. In contrast, a stop-buy order
      will not execute if the market price never rises to the stop price. Similarly,
      a stop-sell order will not execute if the market price never falls to the stop
      price.



Clearing Instructions
Clearing instructions tell brokers and exchanges how to arrange final settlement
of trades. Traders generally do not attach these instructions to each order—instead
they provide them as standing instructions. These instructions indicate what entity
is responsible for clearing and settling the trade. For retail trades, that entity is the
customer’s broker. For institutional trades, that entity may be a custodian or another
broker. When a client uses one broker to arrange trades and another broker to settle
trades, traders say that the first broker gives up the trade to the other broker, who
is often known as the prime broker. Institutional traders provide these instructions
so they can obtain specialized execution services from different brokers while main-
taining a single account for custodial services and other prime brokerage services,
such as margin loans.
    An important clearing instruction that must appear on security sale orders is an
indication of whether the sale is a long sale or a short sale. In either case, the broker
representing the sell order must ensure that the trader can deliver securities for set-
tlement. For a long sale, the broker must confirm that the securities held are available
for delivery. For a short sale, the broker must either borrow the security on behalf of
the client or confirm that the client can borrow the security.




PRIMARY SECURITY MARKETS
                                                                                            14
              define primary and secondary markets and explain how secondary
              markets support primary markets

When issuers first sell their securities to investors, practitioners say that the trades
take place in the primary markets. An issuer makes an initial public offering (IPO)—
sometimes called a placing—of a security issue when it sells the security to the public
for the first time. A seasoned security is a security that an issuer has already issued.
If the issuer wants to sell additional units of a previously issued security, it makes a
seasoned offering (sometimes called a secondary offering). Both types of offerings
occur in the primary market where issuers sell their securities to investors. Later, if
investors trade these securities among themselves, they trade in secondary markets.
This section discusses primary markets and the procedures that issuers use to offer
their securities to the public.


Public Offerings
Corporations generally contract with an investment bank to help them sell their secu-
rities to the public. The investment bank then lines up subscribers who will buy the
security. Investment bankers call this process book building. In London, the book
builder is called the book runner. The bank tries to build a book of orders to which
they can sell the offering. Investment banks often support their book building by
providing investment information and opinion about the issuer to their clients and to
52   Learning Module 1                                                           Market Organization and Structure


                         the public. Before the offering, the issuer generally makes a very detailed disclosure
                         of its business, of the risks inherent in it, and of the uses to which the new funds will
                         be placed.
                              When time is of the essence, issuers in Europe may issue securities through an
                         accelerated book build, in which the investment bank arranges the offering in only
                         one or two days. Such sales often occur at discounted prices.
                              The first public offering of common stock in a company consists of newly issued
                         shares to be sold by the company. It may also include shares that the founders and
                         other early investors in the company seek to sell. The initial public offering provides
                         these investors with a means of liquidating their investments.
                              In an underwritten offering—the most common type of offering—the investment
                         bank guarantees the sale of the issue at an offering price that it negotiates with the
                         issuer. If the issue is undersubscribed, the bank will buy whatever securities it cannot
                         sell at the offering price. In the case of an IPO, the underwriter usually also promises to
                         make a market in the security for about a month to ensure that the secondary market
                         will be liquid and to provide price support, if necessary. For large issues, a syndicate of
                         investment banks and broker–dealers helps the lead underwriter build the book. The
                         issuer usually pays an underwriting fee of about 7 percent for these various services.
                         The underwriting fee is a placement cost of the offering.
                              In a best effort offering, the investment bank acts only as broker. If the offering
                         is undersubscribed, the issuer will not sell as much as it hoped to sell.
                              For both types of offerings, the issuer and the bank usually jointly set the offering
                         price following a negotiation. If they set a price that buyers consider too high, the
                         offering will be undersubscribed, and they will fail to sell the entire issue. If they set
                         the price too low, the offering will be oversubscribed, in which case the securities are
                         often allocated to preferred clients or on a pro-rata basis.
                              (Note that CFA Standard of Professional Conduct III.B—fair dealing—requires
                         that the allocation be based on a written policy disclosed to clients and suggests that
                         the securities be offered on a pro-rata basis among all clients who have comparable
                         relationships with their broker–dealers.)
                              Investment banks have a conflict of interest with respect to the offering price
                         in underwritten offerings. As agents for the issuers, they generally are supposed to
                         select the offering price that will raise the most money. But as underwriters, they
                         have strong incentives to choose a low price. If the price is low, the banks can allocate
                         valuable shares to benefit their clients and thereby indirectly benefit the banks. If the
                         price is too high, the underwriters will have to buy overvalued shares in the offering
                         and perhaps also during the following month if they must support the price in the
                         secondary market, which directly costs the banks. These considerations tend to lower
                         initial offering prices so that prices in the secondary market often rise immediately
                         following an IPO. They are less important in a seasoned offering because trading in
                         the secondary market helps identify the proper price for the offering.
                              First time issuers generally accept lower offering prices because they and many
                         others believe that an undersubscribed IPO conveys very unfavorable information
                         to the market about the company’s prospects at a time when it is most vulnerable to
                         public opinion about its prospects. They fear that an undersubscribed initial public
                         offering will make it substantially harder to raise additional capital in subsequent
                         seasoned offerings.

EXAMPLE 24

   The Healthybots Initial Public Offering
   Healthybots is a health care company that treats diseases using artificial intel-
   ligence–based solutions. Healthybots raised approximately £265 million gross
   through an initial public offering of 103,142,466 ordinary shares at £2.57 per
   ordinary share. After the initial public offering, Healthybots had 213,333,333
   ordinary shares issued and outstanding.
       Healthybots received gross proceeds of approximately £34.3 million and net
   proceeds of £31.8 million. The ordinary shares that were sold to the public rep-
   resented approximately 48 percent of Healthybots’ total issued ordinary shares.
       The shares commenced trading at 8:00 a.m. on the AIM market of the London
   Stock Exchange, where Healthybots opened at £2.74, traded 37 million shares
   between £2.68 and £2.74, and closed at £2.73.

   1. Approximately how many new shares were issued by the company and how
      many shares were sold by the company’s founders? What fraction of their
      holdings in the company did the founders sell?

   Solution to 1:
      Healthybots received gross proceeds of £34.3 million at £2.57 per share, so
      the company issued and sold 13,346,304 shares (= £34.3 million/£2.57 per
      share). The total placement was for 103,142,466 shares, so the founders sold
      89,796,162 shares (= 103,142,466 shares − 13,346,304 shares). Because ap-
      proximately 200 million shares (= 213.3 million shares – 13.3 million shares)
      were outstanding before the placement, the founders sold approximately 45
      percent (= 90 million shares/200 million shares) of the company.

   2. Approximately what return did the subscribers who participated in the IPO
      make on the first day it traded?

   Solution to 2:
      The subscribers bought the stock for £2.57 per share, and it closed at £2.73.
                                               ​2.732.57
      The first day return thus was ​6.2 %   = _     − 2.57 ​× 100​.


   3. Approximately how much did Healthybots pay in placement costs as a per-
      centage of the new funds raised?

   Solution to 3:
      Healthybots obtained gross proceeds of £34.3 million but only raised net
      proceeds of £31.8 million. The £2.5 million difference was the total cost
      of the placement to the firm, which is 7.9 percent of net proceeds, or new
      funds raised (£2.5 million/£31.8 million).



Private Placements and Other Primary Market Transactions
Corporations sometimes issue their securities in private placements. In a private
placement, corporations sell securities directly to a small group of qualified investors,
usually with the assistance of an investment bank. Qualified investors have sufficient
knowledge and experience to recognize the risks that they assume, and sufficient
wealth to assume those risks responsibly. Most countries allow corporations to do
private placements without nearly as much public disclosure as is required for public
54   Learning Module 1                                                           Market Organization and Structure


                         offerings. Private placements, therefore, may be cheaper than public offerings, but the
                         buyers generally require higher returns (lower purchase prices) because they cannot
                         subsequently trade the securities in an organized secondary market.
                             Corporations sometimes sell new issues of seasoned securities directly to the public
                         on a piecemeal basis via a shelf registration. In a shelf registration, the corporation
                         makes all public disclosures that it would for a regular offering, but it does not sell the
                         shares in a single transaction. Instead, it sells the shares directly into the secondary
                         market over time, generally when it needs additional capital. Shelf registrations provide
                         corporations with flexibility in the timing of their capital transactions, and they can
                         alleviate the downward price pressures often associated with large secondary offerings.
                             Many corporations may also issue shares via dividend reinvestment plans (DRPs
                         or DRIPs, for short) that allow their shareholders to reinvest their dividends in newly
                         issued shares of the corporation (in particular, DRPs specify that the corporation issue
                         new shares for the plan rather than purchase them on the open market). These plans
                         sometimes also allow existing shareholders and other investors to buy additional stock
                         at a slight discount to current prices.
                             Finally, corporations can issue new stock via a rights offering. In a rights offering,
                         the corporation distributes rights to buy stock at a fixed price to existing sharehold-
                         ers in proportion to their holdings. Because the rights need not be exercised, they
                         are options. The exercise price, however, is set below the current market price of the
                         stock so that buying stock with the rights is immediately profitable. Consequently,
                         shareholders will experience dilution in the value of their existing shares. They can
                         offset the dilution loss by exercising their rights or by selling the rights to others who
                         will exercise them. Shareholders generally do not like rights offerings because they
                         must provide additional capital (or sell their rights) to avoid losses through dilution.
                         Financial analysts recognize that these securities, although called rights, are actually
                         short-term stock warrants and value them accordingly.
                             The national governments of financially strong countries generally issue their
                         bonds, notes, and bills in public auctions organized by a government agency (usually
                         associated with the finance ministry). They may also sell them directly to dealers.
                             Smaller and less financially secure national governments and most regional gov-
                         ernments often contract with investment banks to help them sell and distribute their
                         securities. The laws of many governments, however, require that they auction their
                         securities.

                            1. In what ways do private placements differ from public placements?

                            Solution:
                               Issuers make private placements to a limited number of investors that
                               generally are financially sophisticated and well informed about risk. The
                               investors generally have some relationship to the issuer. Issuers make public
                               placements when they sell securities to the general public. Public place-
                               ments generally require substantially more financial disclosure than do
                               private placements.
Secondary Security Market and Contract Market Structures                                          55



Importance of Secondary Markets to Primary Markets
Corporations and governments can raise money in the primary markets at lower cost
when their securities will trade in liquid secondary markets. In a liquid market, trad-
ers can buy or sell with low transaction costs and small price concessions when they
want to trade. Buyers value liquidity because they may need to sell their securities to
meet liquidity needs. Investors thus will pay more for securities that they can easily
sell than for those that they cannot easily sell. Higher prices translate into lower costs
of capital for the issuers.

MARKET STRUCTURES                                                                            15

              markets support primary markets
              describe how securities, contracts, and currencies are traded in
              quote-driven, order-driven, and brokered markets

Trading is the successful outcome to a bilateral search in which buyers look for sellers
and sellers look for buyers. Many market structures have developed to reduce the costs
of this search. Markets are liquid when the costs of finding a suitable counterparty
to a trade are low.
    Trading in securities and contracts takes place in a variety of market structures.
The structures differ by when trades can be arranged, who arranges the trades, how
they do so, and how traders learn about possible trading opportunities and executed
trades. This section introduces the various market structures used to trade securities
and contracts. We first consider trading sessions, then execution mechanisms, and
finally market information systems.


Trading Sessions
Markets are organized as call markets or as continuous trading markets. In a call
market, trades can be arranged only when the market is called at a particular time
and place. In contrast in a continuous trading market, trades can be arranged and
executed anytime the market is open.
    Buyers can easily find sellers and vice versa in call markets because all traders
interested in trading (or orders representing their interests) are present at the same
time and place. Call markets thus have the potential to be very liquid when they are
called. But they are completely illiquid between trading sessions. In contrast, traders
can arrange and execute their trades at any time in continuous trading markets, but
doing so can be difficult if the buyers and sellers (or their orders) are not both present
at the same time.
    Most call markets use single price auctions to match buyers to sellers. In these
auctions, the market constructs order books representing all buy orders and all seller
orders. The market then chooses a single trade price that will maximize the total
volume of trade. The order books are supply and demand schedules, and the point at
which they cross determines the trade price.
    Call markets usually are organized just once a day, but some markets organize
calls at more frequent intervals.

                             Many continuous trading markets start their trading with a call market auction.
                         During a pre-opening period, traders submit their orders for the market call. At the
                         opening, any possible trades are arranged and then trading continues in the contin-
                         uous trading session. Some continuous trading markets also close their trading with
                         a call. In these markets, traders who are only interested in trading in the closing call
                         submit market- or limit-on-close orders.

                           Call Markets and Continuous Trading Markets

                           1. What is the main advantage of a call market compared with a continuous
                              trading market?

                           Solution to 1:
                              By gathering all traders to the same place at the same time, a call market
                              makes it easier for buyers to find sellers and vice versa. In contrast, if buyers
                              and sellers (or their orders) are not present at the same time in a continuous
                              market, they cannot trade.

                           2. What is the main advantage of a continuous trading market compared with
                              a call market?

                           Solution to 2:
                              In a continuous trading market, a willing buyer and seller can trade at any
                              time the market is open. In contrast, in a call market trading can take place
                              only when the market is called.



                         Execution Mechanisms
                         The three main types of market structures are quote-driven markets (sometimes
                         called price-driven or dealer markets), order-driven markets, and brokered markets.
                         In quote-driven markets, customers trade with dealers. In order-driven markets, an
                         order matching system run by an exchange, a broker, or an alternative trading system
                         uses rules to arrange trades based on the orders that traders submit. Most exchanges
                         and ECNs organize order-driven markets. In brokered markets, brokers arrange
                         trades between their customers. Brokered markets are common for transactions of
                         unique instruments, such as real estate properties, intellectual properties, or large
                         blocks of securities. Many trading systems use more than one type of market structure.

                         Quote-Driven Markets
                         Worldwide, most trading, other than in stocks, takes place in quote-driven markets.
                         Almost all bonds and currencies and most spot commodities trade in quote-driven
                         markets. Traders call them quote-driven (or price-driven or dealer) because custom-
                         ers trade at the prices quoted by dealers. Depending on the instrument traded, the
                         dealers work for commercial banks, for investment banks, for broker–dealers, or for
                         proprietary trading houses.
                             Quote-driven markets also often are called over-the-counter (OTC) markets
                         because securities used to be literally traded over the dealer’s counter in the dealer’s
                         office. Now, most trades in OTC markets are conducted over proprietary computer
                         communications networks, by telephone, or sometimes over instant messaging systems.

Order-Driven Markets
Order-driven markets arrange trades using rules to match buy orders to sell orders.
The orders may be submitted by customers or by dealers. Almost all exchanges use
order-driven trading systems, and every automated trading system is an order-driven
system.
    Because rules match buyers to sellers, traders often trade with complete strangers.
Order-driven markets thus must have procedures to ensure that buyers and sellers per-
form on their trade contracts. Otherwise, dishonest traders would enter contracts that
they would not settle if a change in market conditions made settlement unprofitable.
    Two sets of rules characterize order-driven market mechanisms: Order matching
rules and trade pricing rules. The order matching rules match buy orders to sell orders.
The trade pricing rules determine the prices at which the matched trades take place.

Order Matching Rules
Order-driven trading systems match buyers to sellers using rules that rank the buy
orders and the sell orders based on price, and often along with other secondary criteria.
The systems then match the highest-ranking buy order with the highest-ranking sell
order. If the buyer is willing to pay at least as much as the seller is willing to receive,
the system will arrange a trade for the minimum of the buy and sell quantities. The
remaining size, if any, is then matched with the next order on the other side and the
process continues until no further trades can be arranged.
    The order precedence hierarchy determines which orders go first. The first rule is
price priority: The highest priced buy orders and the lowest priced sell orders go first.
They are the most aggressively priced orders. Secondary precedence rules determine
how to rank orders at the same price. Most trading systems use time precedence to
rank orders at the same price. The first order to arrive has precedence over other
orders. In trading systems that permit hidden and partially hidden orders, displayed
quantities at a given price generally have precedence over the undisplayed quantities.
So the complete precedence hierarchy is given by price priority, display precedence
at a given price, and finally time precedence among all orders with the same display
status at a given price. These rules give traders incentives to improve price, display
their orders, and arrive early if they want to trade quickly. These incentives increase
market liquidity.

Trade Pricing Rules
After the orders are matched, the trading system then uses its trade pricing rule to
determine the trade price. The three rules that various order-driven markets use to
price their trades are the uniform pricing rule, the discriminatory pricing rule, and
the derivative pricing rule.
    Call markets commonly use the uniform pricing rule. Under this rule, all trades
execute at the same price. The market chooses the price that maximizes the total
quantity traded.
    Continuous trading markets use the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule,
the limit price of the order or quote that first arrived—the standing order—determines
the trade price. This rule allows a large arriving trader to discriminate among standing
limit orders by filling the most aggressively priced orders first at their limit prices and
then filling less aggressively priced orders at their less favorable (from the point of
view of the arriving trader) limit prices. If trading systems did not use this pricing rule,
large traders would break their orders into pieces to price discriminate on their own.

                              Tsubasa submits a day order to buy 15 contracts, limit ¥100.5. With whom
                              does he trade, what is his average trade price, and what does the limit order
                              book look like afterward?

                           Solution:
                              Tsubasa’s buy order first fills with the most aggressively priced sell order,
                              which is Hina’s order for four contracts. A trade takes place at ¥100.4 for
                              four contracts, Hina’s order fills completely, and Tsubasa still has 11 more
                              contracts remaining.
                              The next most aggressively priced sell order is Sakura’s order for six con-
                              tracts. A second trade takes place at ¥100.5 for six contracts, Sakura’s order
                              fills completely, and Tsubasa still has five more contracts remaining.
                              The next most aggressively priced sell order is Miku’s order at ¥100.6. No
                              further trade is possible, however, because her limit sell price is above
                              Tsubasa’s limit buy price. Tsubasa’s average trade price is
                                           4 × ¥100.4 + 6 × ¥100.5 ​.

                                          ​         4+6
                              Because Tsubasa issued a day order, the remainder of his order is placed
                              on the book on the buy side at ¥100.5. The following orders are then on the
                              book:
                                                                    ​

                             Hiroto               8               100.2
                             Shou                10               100.3
                                                                  100.4
                             Tsubasa              5               100.5
                                                                  100.6                 12           Miku
                                                                    ​




                              If Tsubasa had issued an immediate-or-cancel order, the remaining five con-
                              tracts would have been cancelled.

                             Crossing networks use the derivative pricing rule. Crossing networks are trading
                         systems that match buyers and sellers who are willing to trade at prices obtained
                         from other markets. Most systems cross their trades at the midpoint of the best bid
                         and ask quotes published by the exchange at which the security primarily trades.
Secondary Security Market and Contract Market Structures                                   59


This pricing rule is called a derivative pricing rule because the price is derived from
another market. In particular, the price does not depend on the orders submitted
to the crossing network. Some crossing networks are organized as call markets and
others as continuously trading markets. The most important crossing market is the
equity trading system POSIT.

Brokered Markets
The third execution mechanism is the brokered market, in which brokers arrange
trades among their clients. Brokers organize markets for instruments for which finding
a buyer or a seller willing to trade is difficult because the instruments are unique and
thus of interest only to a limited number of people or institutions. These instruments
generally are also infrequently traded and expensive to carry in inventory. Examples
of such instruments include very large blocks of stock, real estate properties, fine art
masterpieces, intellectual properties, operating companies, liquor licenses, and taxi
medallions. Because dealers generally are unable or unwilling to hold these assets
in their inventories, they will not make markets in them. Organizing order-driven
markets for these instruments is not sensible because too few traders would submit
orders to them.
    Successful brokers in these markets try to know everyone who might now or in
the future be willing to trade. They spend most of their time on the telephone and in
meetings building their networks.

EXAMPLE 28

  Quote-Driven, Order-Driven, and Brokered Markets

  1. What are the primary advantages of quote-driven, order-driven, and bro-
     kered markets?

  Solution:
     In a quote-driven market, dealers generally are available to supply liquidity.
     In an order-driven market, traders can supply liquidity to each other. In a
     brokered market, brokers help find traders who are willing to trade when
     dealers would not be willing to make markets and when traders would not
     be willing to post orders.



Market Information Systems
Markets vary in the type and quantity of data that they disseminate to the public.
Traders say that a market is pre-trade transparent if the market publishes real-time
data about quotes and orders. Markets are post-trade transparent if the market pub-
lishes trade prices and sizes soon after trades occur.
    Buy-side traders value transparency because it allows them to better manage their
trading, understand market values, and estimate their prospective and actual transac-
tion costs. In contrast, dealers prefer to trade in opaque markets because, as frequent
traders, they have an information advantage over those who know less than they do.
Bid–ask spreads tend to be wider and transaction costs tend to be higher in opaque
markets because finding the best available price is harder for traders in such markets.

           16            WELL-FUNCTIONING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS

                                       describe characteristics of a well-functioning financial system

                         The financial system allows traders to solve financing and risk management problems.
                         In a well-functioning financial system:
                            ■   investors can easily move money from the present to the future while
                                obtaining a fair rate of return for the risks that they bear;
                            ■   borrowers can easily obtain funds that they need to undertake current proj-
                                ects if they can credibly promise to repay the funds in the future;
                            ■   hedgers can easily trade away or offset the risks that concern them; and
                            ■   traders can easily trade currencies for other currencies or commodities that
                                they need.
                             If the assets or contracts needed to solve these problems are available to trade,
                         the financial system has complete markets. If the costs of arranging these trades are
                         low, the financial system is operationally efficient. If the prices of the assets and
                         contracts reflect all available information related to fundamental values, the financial
                         system is informationally efficient.
                             Well-functioning financial systems are characterized by:
                            ■   the existence of well-developed markets that trade instruments that help
                                people solve their financial problems (complete markets);
                            ■   liquid markets in which the costs of trading—commissions, bid–ask spreads,
                                and order price impacts—are low (operationally efficient markets);
                            ■   timely financial disclosures by corporations and governments that allow
                                market participants to estimate the fundamental values of securities (sup-
                                port informationally efficient markets); and
                            ■   prices that reflect fundamental values so that prices vary primarily in
                                response to changes in fundamental values and not to demands for liquidity
                                made by uninformed traders (informationally efficient markets).
                             Such complete and operationally efficient markets are produced by financial
                         intermediaries who:
                            ■   organize exchanges, brokerages, and alternative trading systems that match
                                buyers to sellers;
                            ■   provide liquidity on demand to traders;
                            ■   securitize assets to produce investment instruments that are attractive to
                                investors and thereby lower the costs of funds for borrowers;
                            ■   run banks that match investors to borrowers by taking deposits and making
                                loans;
                            ■   run insurance companies that pool uncorrelated risks;
                            ■   provide investment advisory services that help investors manage and grow
                                their assets at low cost;
                            ■   organize clearinghouses that ensure everyone settles their trades and con-
                                tracts; and
                            ■   organize depositories that ensure nobody loses their assets.
Well-functioning Financial Systems                                                          61


     The benefits of a well-functioning financial system are huge. In such systems,
investors who need to move money to the future can easily connect with entrepreneurs
who need money now to develop new products and services. Similarly, producers who
would otherwise avoid valuable projects because they are too risky can easily transfer
those risks to others who can better bear them. Most importantly, these transactions
generally can take place among strangers so that the benefits from trading can be
derived from an enormous number of potential matches.
     In contrast, economies that have poorly functioning financial systems have great
difficulties allocating capital among the many companies who could use it. Financial
transactions tend to be limited to arrangements within families when people cannot
easily find trustworthy counterparties who will honor their contracts. In such econ-
omies, capital is allocated inefficiently, risks are not easily shared, and production is
inefficient.
     An extraordinarily important byproduct of an operationally efficient financial
system is the production of informationally efficient prices. Prices are information-
ally efficient when they reflect all available information about fundamental values.
Informative prices are crucially important to the welfare of an economy because
they help ensure that resources go where they are most valuable. Economies that use
resources where they are most valuable are allocationally efficient. Economies that
do not use resources where they are most valuable waste their resources and conse-
quently often are quite poor.
     Well-informed traders make prices informationally efficient. When they buy assets
and contracts that they think are undervalued, they tend to push the assets’ prices
up. Similarly, when they sell assets and contracts that they think are overvalued, they
tend to push the assets’ prices down. The effect of their trading thus causes prices to
reflect their information about values.
     How accurately prices reflect fundamental information depends on the costs of
obtaining fundamental information and on the liquidity available to well-informed
traders. Accounting standards and reporting requirements that produce meaningful
and timely financial disclosures reduce the costs of obtaining fundamental infor-
mation and thereby allow analysts to form more accurate estimates of fundamental
values. Liquid markets allow well-informed traders to fill their orders at low cost.
If filling orders is very costly, informed trading may not be profitable. In that case,
information-motivated traders will not commit resources to collect and analyze data
and they will not trade. Without their research and their associated trading, prices
would be less informative.

   Well-Functioning Financial Systems

   1. As a financial analyst specializing in emerging market equities, you under-
      stand that a well-functioning financial system contributes to the economic
      prosperity of a country. You are asked to start covering a new small market
      country. What factors will you consider when characterizing the quality of
      its financial markets?

   Solution:
      In general, you will consider whether:

       ■   the country has markets that allow its companies and residents to
           finance projects, save for the future, and exchange risk;
       ■   the costs of trading in those markets is low; and
62   Learning Module 1                                                          Market Organization and Structure


                                ■   prices reflect fundamental values.
                               You may specifically check to see whether:

                                ■   fixed income and stock markets allow borrowers to easily obtain capi-
                                    tal from investors;
                                ■   corporations disclose financial and operating data on a timely basis in
                                    conformity to widely respected reporting standards, such as IFRS;
                                ■   forward, futures, and options markets trade instruments that compa-
                                    nies need to hedge their risks;
                                ■   dealers and arbitrageurs allow traders to trade when they want to;
                                ■   bid–ask spreads are small;
                                ■   trades and contracts invariably settle as expected;
                                ■   investment managers provide high-quality management services for
                                    reasonable fees;
                                ■   banks and other financing companies are well capitalized and thus able
                                    to help investors provide capital to borrowers;
                                ■   securitized assets are available and represent reasonable credit risks;
                                ■   insurance companies are well capitalized and thus able to help those
                                    exposed to risks insure against them; and
                                ■   price volatility appears consistent with changes in fundamental values.




           17            MARKET REGULATION

                                       describe objectives of market regulation

                         Government agencies and practitioner organizations regulate many markets and the
                         financial intermediaries that participate in them. The regulators generally seek to
                         promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately
                         reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs. This section
                         identifies the problems that financial regulators hope to solve and the objectives of
                         their regulations.
                             Regrettably, some people will steal from each other if given a chance, especially if
                         the probability of detection is low or if the penalty for being caught is low. The number
                         of ways that people can steal or misappropriate wealth generally increases with the
                         complexity of their relationships and with asymmetries in their knowledge. Because
                         financial markets tend to be complex, and because customers are often much less
                         sophisticated than the professionals that serve them, the potential for losses through
                         various frauds can be unacceptably high in unregulated markets.
                             Regulators thus ensure that systems are in place to protect customers from fraud.
                         In principle, the customers themselves would demand such systems as a condition of
                         doing business. When customers are unsophisticated or poorly informed, however, they
                         may not know how to protect themselves. When the costs of learning are large—as
                         they often are in complex financial markets—having regulators look out for the public
                         interest can be economically efficient.
Market Regulation                                                                              63


    More customer money is probably lost in financial markets through negligence
than through outright fraud. Most customers in financial markets use various agents
to help them solve problems that they do not understand well. These agents include
securities brokers, financial advisers, investment managers, and insurance agents.
Because customers generally do not have much information about market condi-
tions, they find it extremely difficult to measure the added value they obtain from
their agents. This problem is especially challenging when performance has a strong
random component. In that case, determining whether agents are skilled or lucky is
very difficult. Moreover, if the agent is a good salesman, the customer may not criti-
cally evaluate their agent’s performance. These conditions, which characterize most
financial markets, ensure that customers cannot easily determine whether their agents
are working faithfully for them. They tend to lose if their agents are unqualified or
lazy, or if they unconsciously favor themselves and their friends over their clients, as
is natural for even the most honest people.
    Regulators help solve these agency problems by setting minimum standards of
competence for agents and by defining and enforcing minimum standards of practice.
CFA Institute provides significant standard setting leadership in the areas of investment
management and investment performance reporting through its Chartered Financial
Analyst Program, in which you are studying, and its Global Investment Performance
Standards. In principle, regulation would not be necessary if customers could identify
competent agents and effectively measure their performance. In the financial markets,
doing so is very difficult.
    Regulators often act to level the playing field for market participants. For example,
in many jurisdictions, insider trading in securities is illegal. The rule prevents corporate
insiders and others with access to corporate information from trading on material
information that has not been released to the public. The purpose of the rule is to
reduce the profits that insiders could extract from the markets. These profits would
come from other traders who would lose when they trade with well-informed insiders.
Because traders tend to withdraw from markets when they lose, rules against insider
trading help keep markets liquid. They also keep corporate insiders from hoarding
information.
    Many situations arise in financial markets in which common standards benefit
everyone involved. For example, having all companies report financial results on a
common basis allows financial analysts to easily compare companies. Accordingly,
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US-based Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB), among many others, promulgate common finan-
cial standards to which all companies must report. The benefits of having common
reporting standards has led to a very successful and continuing effort to converge all
accounting standards to a single worldwide standard. Without such regulations, inves-
tors might eventually refuse to invest in companies that do not report to a common
standard, but such market-based discipline is a very slow regulator of behavior, and
it would have little effect on companies that do not need to raise new capital.
    Regulators generally require that financial firms maintain minimum levels of
capital. These capital requirements serve two purposes. First, they ensure that the
companies will be able to honor their contractual commitments when unexpected
market movements or poor decisions cause them to lose money. Second, they ensure
that the owners of financial firms have substantial interest in the decisions that
they make. Without a substantial financial interest in the decisions that they make,
companies often take too many risks and exercise poor judgment about extending
credit to others. When such companies fail, they impose significant costs on others.
Minimum capital requirements reduce the probability that financial firms will fail and
they reduce the disruptions associated with those failures that do occur. In principle,
64   Learning Module 1                                                         Market Organization and Structure


                         a firm’s customers and counterparties could require minimum capital levels as a con-
                         dition of doing business with the firm, but they have more difficulty enforcing their
                         contracts than do governments who can imprison people.
                              Regulators similarly regulate insurance companies and pension funds that make
                         long-term promises to their clients. Such entities need to maintain adequate reserves
                         to ensure that they can fund their liabilities. Unfortunately, their managers have a
                         tendency to underestimate these reserves if they will not be around when the liabil-
                         ities come due. Again, in principle, policyholders and employees could regulate the
                         behavior of their insurance funds and their employers by refusing to contract with
                         them if they do not promise to adequately fund their liabilities. In practice, however,
                         the sophistication, information, and time necessary to write and enforce contracts
                         that control these problems are beyond the reach of most people. The government
                         thus is a sensible regulator of such problems.
                              Many regulators are self-regulating organizations (SROs) that regulate their
                         members. Exchanges, clearinghouses, and dealer trade organizations are examples
                         of self-regulating organizations. In some cases, the members of these organizations
                         voluntarily subject themselves to the SRO’s regulations to promote the common good.
                         In other cases, governments delegate regulatory and enforcement authorities to SROs,
                         usually subject to the supervision of a government agency, such as a national securities
                         and exchange authority. Exchanges, dealer associations, and clearing agencies often
                         regulate their members with these delegated powers.
                              By setting high standards of behavior, SROs help their members obtain the confi-
                         dence of their customers. They also reduce the chance that members of the SRO will
                         incur losses when dealing with other members of the SRO.
                              When regulators fail to solve the problems discussed here, the financial system
                         does not function well. People who lose money stop saving and borrowers with good
                         ideas cannot fund their projects. Similarly, hedgers withdraw from markets when the
                         costs of hedging are high. Without the ability to hedge, producers become reluctant
                         to specialize because specialization generally increases risk. Because specialization
                         also decreases costs, however, production becomes less efficient as producers chose
                         safer technologies. Economies that cannot solve the regulatory problems described
                         in this section tend to operate less efficiently than do better regulated economies, and
                         they tend to be less wealthy.
                              To summarize, the objectives of market regulation are to:
                            1. control fraud;
                            2. control agency problems;
                            3. promote fairness;
                            4. set mutually beneficial standards;
                            5. prevent undercapitalized financial firms from exploiting their investors by
                               making excessively risky investments; and
                            6. ensure that long-term liabilities are funded.
                             Regulation is necessary because regulating certain behaviors through market-based
                         mechanisms is too costly for people who are unsophisticated and uninformed.
                         Effectively regulated markets allow people to better achieve their financial goals.

                         EXAMPLE 30

                           Bankrupt Traders
                           You are the chief executive officer of a brokerage that is a member of a clear-
                           inghouse. A trader who clears through your firm is bankrupt at midday, but you
                           do not yet know it even though your clearing agreement with him explicitly
Market Regulation                                                                        65


  requires that he immediately report significant losses. The trader knows that
  if he takes a large position, prices might move in his favor so that he will no
  longer be bankrupt. The trader attempts to do so and succeeds. You find out
  about this later in the evening.

  1. Why does the clearinghouse regulate its members?

  Solution to 1:
       The clearinghouse regulates its members to ensure that no member imposes
       costs on another member by failing to settle a trade.

  2. What should you do about the trader?

  Solution to 2:
       You should immediately end your clearing relationship with the trader and
       confiscate his trading profits. The trader was trading with your firm’s capital
       after he became bankrupt. Had he lost, your firm would have borne the loss.

  3. Why would the clearinghouse allow you to keep his trading profits?

  Solution to 3:
       If the clearinghouse did not permit you to keep his trading profits, other
       traders similarly situated might attempt the same strategy.




  SUMMARY
This reading introduces how the financial system operates and explains how
well-functioning financial systems lead to wealthy economies. Financial analysts
need to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead
to trading decisions.
    The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that
operate in them. These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers. They may
trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only
may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller
through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary’s balance sheet. The
buyer and seller may exchange instruments, cash flows, or risks.
    The following points, among others, were made in this reading:
   ■    The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to con-
        tract with each other to move money through time, to hedge risks, and to
        exchange assets that they value less for those that they value more.
   ■    Investors move money from the present to the future when they save. They
        expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time. Borrowers
        move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and
        expenditures. Hedgers trade to reduce their exposure to risks they prefer
        not to take. Information-motivated traders are active investment managers
        who try to identify under- and overvalued instruments.
   ■    Securities are first sold in primary markets by their issuers. They then trade
        in secondary markets.
66   Learning Module 1                                                        Market Organization and Structure


                         ■   People invest in pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment
                             management services of their managers.
                         ■   Forward contracts allow buyers and sellers to arrange for future sales at
                             predetermined prices. Futures contracts are forward contracts guaranteed
                             by clearinghouses. The guarantee ensures that strangers are willing to trade
                             with each other and that traders can offset their positions by trading with
                             anybody. These features of futures contract markets make them highly
                             attractive to hedgers and information-motivated traders.
                         ■   Many financial intermediaries connect buyers to sellers in a given instru-
                             ment, acting directly as brokers and exchanges or indirectly as dealers and
                             arbitrageurs.
                         ■   Financial intermediaries create instruments when they conduct arbitrage,
                             securitize assets, borrow to lend, manage investment funds, or pool insur-
                             ance contracts. These activities all transform cash flows and risks from one
                             form to another. Their services allow buyers and sellers to connect with each
                             other through instruments that meet their specific needs.
                         ■   Financial markets work best when strangers can contract with each other
                             without worrying about whether their counterparts are able and willing
                             to honor their contract. Clearinghouses, variation margins, maintenance
                             margins, and settlement guarantees made by creditworthy brokers on behalf
                             of their clients help manage credit risk and ultimately allow strangers to
                             contract with each other.
                         ■   Information-motivated traders short sell when they expect that prices will
                             fall. Hedgers short sell to reduce the risks of a long position in a related
                             contract or commodity.
                         ■   Margin loans allow people to buy more securities than their equity would
                             otherwise permit them to buy. The larger positions expose them to more
                             risk so that gains and losses for a given amount of equity will be larger. The
                             leverage ratio is the value of a position divided by the value of the equity
                             supporting it. The returns to the equity in a position are equal to the lever-
                             age ratio times the returns to the unleveraged position.
                         ■   To protect against credit losses, brokers demand maintenance margin
                             payments from their customers who have borrowed cash or securities
                             when adverse price changes cause their customer’s equity to drop below the
                             maintenance margin ratio. Brokers close positions for customers who do not
                             satisfy these margin calls.
                         ■   Orders are instructions to trade. They always specify instrument, side (buy
                             or sell), and quantity. They usually also provide several other instructions.
                         ■   Market orders tend to fill quickly but often at inferior prices. Limit orders
                             generally fill at better prices if they fill, but they may not fill. Traders choose
                             order submission strategies on the basis of how quickly they want to trade,
                             the prices they are willing to accept, and the consequences of failing to
                             trade.
                         ■   Stop instructions are attached to other orders to delay efforts to fill them
                             until the stop condition is satisfied. Although stop orders are often used to
                             stop losses, they are not always effective.

                             ment programs, and rights offerings. Investment banks have a conflict of

   ■   Well-functioning secondary markets are essential to raising capital in the
       primary markets because investors value the ability to sell their securities if
       they no longer want to hold them or if they need to disinvest to raise cash.
       If they cannot trade their securities in a liquid market, they will not pay as
       much for them.
   ■   Matching buyers and sellers in call markets is easy because the traders (or
       their orders) come together at the same time and place.
   ■   Dealers provide liquidity in quote-driven markets. Public traders as well as
       dealers provide liquidity in order-driven markets.
   ■   Order-driven markets arrange trades by ranking orders using precedence
       rules. The rules generally ensure that traders who provide the best prices,
       display the most size, and arrive early trade first. Continuous order-driven
       markets price orders using the discriminatory pricing rule. Under this rule,
       standing limit orders determine trade prices.
   ■   Brokers help people trade unique instruments or positions for which finding
       a buyer or a seller is difficult.
   ■   Transaction costs are lower in transparent markets than in opaque markets
       because traders can more easily determine market value and more easily
       manage their trading in transparent markets.
   ■   A well-functioning financial system allows people to trade instruments that
       best solve their wealth and risk management problems with low transaction
       costs. Complete and liquid markets characterize a well-functioning financial
       system. Complete markets are markets in which the instruments needed
       to solve investment and risk management problems are available to trade.
       Liquid markets are markets in which traders can trade when they want to
       trade at low cost.
   ■   The financial system is operationally efficient when its markets are liquid.
       Liquid markets lower the costs of raising capital.
   ■   A well-functioning financial system promotes wealth by ensuring that cap-
       ital allocation decisions are well made. A well-functioning financial system
       also promotes wealth by allowing people to share the risks associated with
       valuable products that would otherwise not be undertaken.
   ■   Prices are informationally efficient when they reflect all available informa-
       tion about fundamental values. Information-motivated traders make prices
       informationally efficient. Prices will be most informative in liquid markets
       because information-motivated traders will not invest in information and
       research if establishing positions based on their analyses is too costly.
   ■   Regulators generally seek to promote fair and orderly markets in which
       traders can trade at prices that accurately reflect fundamental values
       without incurring excessive transaction costs. Governmental agencies and
       self-regulating organizations of practitioners provide regulatory services
       that attempt to make markets safer and more efficient.
   ■   Mandated financial disclosure programs for the issuers of publicly traded
       securities ensure that information necessary to estimate security values is
       available to financial analysts on a consistent basis.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                         1. Akihiko Takabe has designed a sophisticated forecasting model, which predicts
                            the movements in the overall stock market, in the hope of earning a return in
                            excess of a fair return for the risk involved. He uses the predictions of the model
                            to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell the shares of an index fund that aims to
                            replicate the movements of the stock market. Takabe would best be characterized
                            as a(n):
                            A. hedger.

                            B. investor.

                            C. information-motivated trader.

                         2. James Beach is young and has substantial wealth. A significant proportion of
                            his stock portfolio consists of emerging market stocks that offer relatively high
                            expected returns at the cost of relatively high risk. Beach believes that investment
                            in emerging market stocks is appropriate for him given his ability and willingness
                            to take risk. Which of the following labels most appropriately describes Beach?
                            A. Hedger.

                            B. Investor.

                            C. Information-motivated trader.

                         3. Lisa Smith owns a manufacturing company in the United States. Her company
                            has sold goods to a customer in Brazil and will be paid in Brazilian real (BRL) in
                            three months. Smith is concerned about the possibility of the BRL depreciating
                            more than expected against the US dollar (USD). Therefore, she is planning to sell
                            three-month futures contracts on the BRL. The seller of such contracts gener-
                            ally gains when the BRL depreciates against the USD. If Smith were to sell these
                            future contracts, she would most appropriately be described as a(n):
                            A. hedger.

                            B. investor.

                            C. information-motivated trader.

                         4. Which of the following is not a function of the financial system?
                            A. To regulate arbitrageurs’ profits (excess returns).

                            B. To help the economy achieve allocational efficiency.

                            C. To facilitate borrowing by businesses to fund current operations.

                         5. An investor primarily invests in stocks of publicly traded companies. The investor
                            wants to increase the diversification of his portfolio. A friend has recommended
                            investing in real estate properties. The purchase of real estate would best be char-
                            acterized as a transaction in the:
                            A. derivative investment market.

                            B. traditional investment market.

   C. alternative investment market.

6. A hedge fund holds its excess cash in 90-day commercial paper and negotiable
   certificates of deposit. The cash management policy of the hedge fund is best
   described as using:
   A. capital market instruments.

   B. money market instruments.

   C. intermediate-term debt instruments.

7. An oil and gas exploration and production company announces that it is offering
   30 million shares to the public at $45.50 each. This transaction is most likely a sale
   in the:
   A. futures market.

   B. primary market.

   C. secondary market.

8. Consider a mutual fund that invests primarily in fixed-income securities that
   have been determined to be appropriate given the fund’s investment goal. Which
   of the following is least likely to be a part of this fund?
   A. Warrants.

   B. Commercial paper.

   C. Repurchase agreements.

9. A friend has asked you to explain the differences between open-end and
   closed-end funds. Which of the following will you most likely include in your
   explanation?
   A. Closed-end funds are unavailable to new investors.

   B. When investors sell the shares of an open-end fund, they can receive a dis-
      count or a premium to the fund’s net asset value.

   C. When selling shares, investors in an open-end fund sell the shares back to
      the fund whereas investors in a closed-end fund sell the shares to others in
      the secondary market.

10. The Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipts (SPDRs) is an investment that tracks
    the S&P 500 stock market index. Purchases and sales of SPDRs during an average
    trading day are best described as:
   A. primary market transactions in a pooled investment.

   B. secondary market transactions in a pooled investment.

   C. secondary market transactions in an actively managed investment.

11. Which of the following statements about exchange-traded funds is most correct?
   A. Exchange-traded funds are not backed by any assets.

                            B. The investment companies that create exchange-traded funds are financial
                               intermediaries.

                            C. The transaction costs of trading shares of exchange-traded funds are sub-
                               stantially greater than the combined costs of trading the underlying assets of
                               the fund.

                         12. The usefulness of a forward contract is limited by some problems. Which of the
                             following is most likely one of those problems?
                            A. Once you have entered into a forward contract, it is difficult to exit from the
                               contract.

                            B. Entering into a forward contract requires the long party to deposit an initial
                               amount with the short party.

                            C. If the price of the underlying asset moves adversely from the perspective of
                               the long party, periodic payments must be made to the short party.

                         13. Tony Harris is planning to start trading in commodities. He has heard about the
                             use of futures contracts on commodities and is learning more about them. Which
                             of the following is Harris least likely to find associated with a futures contract?
                            A. Existence of counterparty risk.

                            B. Standardized contractual terms.

                            C. Payment of an initial margin to enter into a contract.

                         14. A German company that exports machinery is expecting to receive $10 million
                             in three months. The firm converts all its foreign currency receipts into euros.
                             The chief financial officer of the company wishes to lock in a minimum fixed rate
                             for converting the $10 million to euro but also wants to keep the flexibility to use
                             the future spot rate if it is favorable. What hedging transaction is most likely to
                             achieve this objective?
                            A. Selling dollars forward.

                            B. Buying put options on the dollar.

                            C. Selling futures contracts on dollars.

                         15. A book publisher requires substantial quantities of paper. The publisher and a
                             paper producer have entered into an agreement for the publisher to buy and the
                             producer to supply a given quantity of paper four months later at a price agreed
                             upon today. This agreement is a:
                            A. futures contract.

                            B. forward contract.

                            C. commodity swap.

                         16. The Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipts (SPDRs) is an exchange-traded fund
                             in the United States that is designed to track the S&P 500 stock market index.
                             The latest price of a share of SPDRs is $290. A trader has just bought call options
                             on shares of SPDRs for a premium of $3 per share. The call options expire in six
                             months and have an exercise price of $305 per share. On the expiration date, the
                             trader will exercise the call options (ignore any transaction costs) if and only if

   A. below $305 per share.

   B. above $305 per share.

   C. above $308 per share.

17. Jason Schmidt works for a hedge fund and he specializes in finding profit oppor-
    tunities that are the result of inefficiencies in the market for convertible bonds—
    bonds that can be converted into a predetermined amount of a company’s com-
    mon stock. Schmidt tries to find convertibles that are priced inefficiently relative
    to the underlying stock. The trading strategy involves the simultaneous purchase
    of the convertible bond and the short sale of the underlying common stock. The
    above process could best be described as:
   A. hedging.

   B. arbitrage.

   C. securitization.

18. Pierre-Louis Robert just purchased a call option on shares of the Michelin Group.
    A few days ago he wrote a put option on Michelin shares. The call and put op-
    tions have the same exercise price, expiration date, and number of shares under-
    lying. Considering both positions, Robert’s exposure to the risk of the stock of the
    Michelin Group is:

    period?
   A. 20 percent.

   B. 33.33 percent.

   C. 50 percent.

21. Jason Williams purchased 500 shares of a company at $32 per share. The stock
    was bought on 75 percent margin. One month later, Williams had to pay interest
    on the amount borrowed at a rate of 2 percent per month. At that time, Williams
    received a dividend of $0.50 per share. Immediately after that he sold the shares

                         22. Caroline Rogers believes the price of Gamma Corp. stock will go down in the
                             near future. She has decided to sell short 200 shares of Gamma Corp. at the cur-
                             rent market price of €47. The initial margin requirement is 40 percent. Which of
                             the following is an appropriate statement regarding the margin requirement that
                             Rogers is subject to on this short sale?
                            A. She will need to contribute €3,760 as margin.

                            B. She will need to contribute €5,640 as margin.

                            C. She will only need to leave the proceeds from the short sale as deposit and
                               does not need to contribute any additional funds.

                         23. The current price of a stock is $25 per share. You have $10,000 to invest. You bor-
                             row an additional $10,000 from your broker and invest $20,000 in the stock. If the
                             maintenance margin is 30 percent, at what price will a margin call first occur?
                            A. $9.62.

29. You own shares of a company that are currently trading at $30 a share. Your
    technical analysis of the shares indicates a support level of $27.50. That is, if the
    price of the shares is going down, it is more likely to stay above this level rather
    than fall below it. If the price does fall below this level, however, you believe that
    the price may continue to decline. You have no immediate intent to sell the shares
    but are concerned about the possibility of a huge loss if the share price declines
    below the support level. Which of the following types of orders could you place

                         32. A German publicly traded company, to raise new capital, gave its existing share-
                             holders the opportunity to subscribe for new shares. The existing shareholders
                             could purchase two new shares at a subscription price of €4.58 per share for
                             every 15 shares held. This is an example of a(n):

                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. C is correct. Takabe is best characterized as an information-motivated trader.
                            Takabe believes that his model provides him superior information about the
                            movements in the stock market and his motive for trading is to profit from this
                            information.

                         2. B is correct. Beach is an investor. He is simply investing in risky assets consistent
                            with his level of risk aversion. Beach is not hedging any existing risk or using in-
                            formation to identify and trade mispriced securities. Therefore, he is not a hedger
                            or an information-motivated trader.

                         3. A is correct. Smith is a hedger. The short position on the BRL futures contract
                            offsets the BRL long position in three months. She is hedging the risk of the BRL
                            depreciating against the USD. If the BRL depreciates, the value of the cash inflow
                            goes down in USD terms but there is a gain on the futures contracts.

                         4. A is correct. Regulation of arbitrageurs’ profits is not a function of the financial
                            system. The financial system facilitates the allocation of capital to the best uses
                            and the purposes for which people use the financial system, including borrowing
                            money.

                         5. C is correct. The purchase of real estate properties is a transaction in the alterna-
                            tive investment market.

                         6. B is correct. The 90-day commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit
                            are money market instruments.

                         7. B is correct. This transaction is a sale in the primary market. It is a sale of shares
                            from the issuer to the investor and funds flow to the issuer of the security from
                            the purchaser.

                         8. A is correct. Warrants are least likely to be part of the fund. Warrant holders have
                            the right to buy the issuer’s common stock. Thus, warrants are typically classified
                            as equity and are least likely to be a part of a fixed-income mutual fund. Com-
                            mercial paper and repurchase agreements are short-term fixed-income securities.

                         9. C is correct. When investors want to sell their shares, investors of an open-end
                            fund sell the shares back to the fund whereas investors of a closed-end fund sell
                            the shares to others in the secondary market. Closed-end funds are available to
                            new investors but they must purchase shares in the fund in the secondary mar-
                            ket. The shares of a closed-end fund trade at a premium or discount to net asset
                            value.

                         10. B is correct. SPDRs trade in the secondary market and are a pooled investment
                             vehicle.

                         11. B is correct. The investment companies that create exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
                             are financial intermediaries. ETFs are securities that represent ownership in
                             the assets held by the fund. The transaction costs of trading shares of ETFs are
                             substantially lower than the combined costs of trading the underlying assets of
                             the ETF.

                         12. A is correct. Once you have entered into a forward contract, it is difficult to exit
                             from the contract. As opposed to a futures contract, trading out of a forward
                             contract is quite difficult. There is no exchange of cash at the origination of a
Solutions                                                                                     77


   forward contract. There is no exchange on a forward contract until the maturity
   of the contract.

13. A is correct. Harris is least likely to find counterparty risk associated with a
    futures contract. There is limited counterparty risk in a futures contract because
    the clearinghouse is on the other side of every contract.

14. B is correct. Buying a put option on the dollar will ensure a minimum exchange
    rate but does not have to be exercised if the exchange rate moves in a favorable
    direction. Forward and futures contracts would lock in a fixed rate but would not
    allow for the possibility to profit in case the value of the dollar three months later
    in the spot market turns out to be greater than the value in the forward or futures
    contract.

15. B is correct. The agreement between the publisher and the paper supplier to
    respectively buy and supply paper in the future at a price agreed upon today is a
    forward contract.

16. B is correct. The holder of the call option will exercise the call options if the price
    is above the exercise price of $305 per share. Note that if the stock price is above
    $305 but less than $308, the option would be exercised even though the net result
    for the option buyer after considering the premium is a loss. For example, if the
    stock price is $307, the option buyer would exercise the option to make $2 = $307
    – $305 per share, resulting in a loss of $1 = $3 – $2 after considering the premi-
    um. It is better to exercise and have a loss of only $1, however, rather than not
    exercise and lose the entire $3 premium.

17. B is correct. The process can best be described as arbitrage because it involves
    buying and selling instruments, whose values are closely related, at different pric-
    es in different markets.

18. A is correct. Robert’s exposure to the risk of the stock of the Michelin Group is
    long. The exposure as a result of the long call position is long. The exposure as a
    result of the short put position is also long. Therefore, the combined exposure is
    long.

19. B is correct. The maximum leverage ratio is 1.82 = 100% position ÷ 55% equity.
    The maximum leverage ratio associated with a position financed by the minimum
    margin requirement is one divided by the minimum margin requirement.

20. C is correct. The return is 50 percent. If the position had been unleveraged, the
    return would be 20% = (60 – 50)/50. Because of leverage, the return is 50% = 2.5
    × 20%.
    Another way to look at this problem is that the equity contributed by the trader
    (the minimum margin requirement) is 40% = 100% ÷ 2.5. The trader contributed
    $20 = 40% of $50 per share. The gain is $10 per share, resulting in a return of 50%
    = 10/20.

21. B is correct. The return is –15.4 percent.

       Total cost of the purchase = $16,000 = 500 × $32
       Equity invested = $12,000 = 0.75 × $16,000
       Amount borrowed = $4,000 = 16,000 – 12,000
       Interest paid at month end = $80 = 0.02 × $4,000
       Dividend received at month end = $250 = 500 × $0.50
       Proceeds on stock sale = $14,000 = 500 × $28

                                Total commissions paid = $20 = $10 + $10
                                Net gain/loss = −$1,850 = −16,000 − 80 + 250 + 14,000 − 20
                                Initial investment including commission on purchase = $12,010
                                Return = −15.4% = −$1,850/$12,010

                         22. A is correct. She will need to contribute €3,760 as margin. In view of the possibil-
                             ity of a loss, if the stock price goes up, she will need to contribute €3,760 = 40% of
                             €9,400 as the initial margin. Rogers will need to leave the proceeds from the short
                             sale (€9,400 = 200 × €47) on deposit.

                         23. B is correct. A margin call will first occur at a price of $17.86. Because you have
                             contributed half and borrowed the remaining half, your initial equity is 50 per-
                             cent of the initial stock price, or $12.50 = 0.50 × $25. If P is the subsequent price,
                             your equity would change by an amount equal to the change in price. So, your
                             equity at price P would be 12.50 + (P – 25). A margin call will occur when the
                             percentage margin drops to 30 percent. So, the price at which a margin call will
                             occur is the solution to the following equation.
                            _ Equity/Share     12.50 + P − 25
                            	​ Price/Share ​ = ___________
                                                 
                                               ​     P        ​ = 30%​

                            The solution is P = $17.86.

                         24. C is correct. The market is 9.95 bid, offered at 10.02. The best bid is at €9.95 and
                             the best offer is €10.02.

                         25. C is correct. This order is said to make a new market. The new buy order is at
                             ¥123.40, which is better than the current best bid of ¥123.35. Therefore, the buy
                             order is making a new market. Had the new order been at ¥123.35, it would be
                             said to make the market. Because the new buy limit order is at a price less than
                             the best offer of ¥123.80, it will not immediately execute and is not taking the
                             market.

                         26. A is correct. This order is said to take the market. The new sell order is at $54.62,
                             which is at the current best bid. Therefore, the new sell order will immediately
                             trade with the current best bid and is taking the market.

                         27. B is correct. An instruction regarding when to fill an order is considered a validity
                             instruction.

                         28. B is correct. The maximum possible loss is $1,300. If the stock price crosses $50,
                             the stop buy order will become valid and will get executed at a maximum limit
                             price of $55. The maximum loss per share is $13 = $55 – $42, or $1,300 for 100
                             shares.

                         29. B is correct. The most appropriate order is a good-till-cancelled stop sell order.
                             This order will be acted on if the stock price declines below a specified price (in
                             this case, $27.50). This order is sometimes referred to as a good-till-cancelled
                             stop loss sell order. You are generally bullish about the stock, as indicated by no
                             immediate intent to sell, and would expect a loss on short selling the stock. A
                             stop buy order is placed to buy a stock when the stock is going up.

                         30. B is correct. The investment bank bears the risk that the issue may be undersub-
                             scribed at the offering price. If the entire issue is not sold, the investment bank
                             underwriting the issue will buy the unsold securities at the offering price.

                         31. B is correct. This sale is a private placement. As the company is already publicly
                             traded, the share sale is clearly not an initial public offering. The sale also does
Solutions                                                                                      79


   not involve a shelf registration because the company is not selling shares to the
   public on a piecemeal basis.

32. A is correct. This offering is a rights offering. The company is distributing rights
    to buy stock at a fixed price to existing shareholders in proportion to their
    holdings.

33. C is correct. Order III (time of arrival of 9:53:04) has precedence. In the order
    precedence hierarchy, the first rule is price priority. Based on this rule, sell orders
    II, III, and IV get precedence over order I. The next rule is display precedence at a
    given price. Because order II is a hidden order, orders III and IV get precedence.
    Finally, order III gets precedence over order IV based on time priority at same
    price and same display status.

34. C is correct. The order for 500 shares would get cancelled; there would be no fill.
    Li is willing to buy at CNY 74.25 or less but the minimum offer price in the book
    is CNY 74.30; therefore, no part of the order would be filled. Because Li’s order is
    immediate-or-cancel, it would be cancelled.

35. B is correct. Ian’s average trade price is:
               300 × £20.02 + 400 × £19.89 + 200 × £19.84
   	​£19.92 = ________________________________
                  
              ​            
                        300 + 400 + 200       ​
   Ian’s sell order first fills with the most aggressively priced buy order, which is
   Mary’s order for 300 shares at £20.02. Ian still has 700 shares for sale. The next
   most aggressively priced buy order is Ann’s order for 400 shares at £19.89. This
   order is filled. Ian still has 300 shares for sale. The next most aggressively priced
   buy order is Paul’s order for 200 shares at £19.84. A third trade takes place. Ian
   still has 100 shares for sale.
   The next buy order is Keith’s order for 1,000 shares at £19.70. However, this price
   is below Ian’s limit price of £19.83. Therefore, no more trade is possible.

36. C is correct. In such a market, well-informed traders will find it easy to trade and
    their trading will make the market more informationally efficient. In a liquid mar-
    ket, it is easier for informed traders to fill their orders. Their trading will cause
    prices to incorporate their information and the prices will be more in line with
    the fundamental values.

37. C is correct. Ensure that investors in the stock market achieve a rate of return
    that is at least equal to the risk-free rate of return is least likely to be included as
    an objective of market regulation. Stocks are risky investments and there would
    be occasions when a stock market investment would not only have a return less
    than the risk-free rate but also a negative return. Minimizing agency costs and
    ensuring that financial markets are fair and orderly are objectives of market
    regulation.

INTRODUCTION
Investors gather and analyze vast amounts of information about security markets on
                                                                                         1
a continual basis. Because this work can be both time consuming and data intensive,
investors often use a single measure that consolidates this information and reflects
the performance of an entire security market.
    Security market indexes were first introduced as a simple measure to reflect the
performance of the US stock market. Since then, security market indexes have evolved
into important multi-purpose tools that help investors track the performance of
various security markets, estimate risk, and evaluate the performance of investment
managers. They also form the basis for new investment products.

                         ORIGIN OF MARKET INDEXES

                            Investors had access to regularly published data on individual security prices
                            in London as early as 1698, but nearly 200 years passed before they had access
                            to a simple indicator to reflect security market information. To give readers a
                            sense of how the US stock market in general performed on a given day, publish-
                            ers Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones introduced the Dow Jones Average,
                            the world’s first security market index, in 1884. The index, which appeared in
                            The Customers’ Afternoon Letter, consisted of the stocks of nine railroads and
                            two industrial companies. It eventually became the Dow Jones Transportation
                            Average. Convinced that industrial companies, rather than railroads, would
                            be “the great speculative market” of the future, Dow and Jones introduced a
                            second index in May 1896—the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). It had
                            an initial value of 40.94 and consisted of 12 stocks from major US industries.
                            Today, investors can choose from among thousands of indexes to measure and
                            monitor different security markets and asset classes.

                            This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 defines a security market index and
                         explains how to calculate the price return and total return of an index for a single
                         period and over multiple periods. Section 3 describes how indexes are constructed
                         and managed. Section 4 discusses the use of market indexes. Sections 5, 6, and 7 dis-
                         cuss various types of indexes, and the final section summarizes the reading. Practice
                         problems follow the conclusions and summary.

                                       describe a security market index
                                       calculate and interpret the value, price return, and total return of an
                                       index

                         A security market index represents a given security market, market segment, or asset
                         class. Most indexes are constructed as portfolios of marketable securities.
                             The value of an index is calculated on a regular basis using either the actual or
                         estimated market prices of the individual securities, known as constituent securities,
                         within the index. For each security market index, investors may encounter two versions
                         of the same index (i.e., an index with identical constituent securities and weights):
                         one version based on price return and one version based on total return. As the name
                         suggests, a price return index, also known as a price index, reflects only the prices of
                         the constituent securities within the index. A total return index, in contrast, reflects
                         not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income
                         received since inception.
Index Definition and Calculations of Value and Returns                                         83


    At inception, the values of the price and total return versions of an index are
equal. As time passes, however, the value of the total return index, which includes
the reinvestment of all dividends and/or interest received, will exceed the value of the
price return index by an increasing amount. A look at how the values of each version
are calculated over multiple periods illustrates why.
    The value of a price return index is calculated as:
                N
              ​∑​n​i​​Pi​​
              _i=1
   	​ PRI
     ​V ​ ​ = ​ D ​	                                                                     (1)

   where

   VPRI = the value of the price return index

        ni = the number of units of constituent security i held in the index portfolio

        N = the number of constituent securities in the index

      Pi = the unit price of constituent security i

        D = the value of the divisor
    The divisor is a number initially chosen at inception. It is frequently chosen so
that the price index has a convenient initial value, such as 1,000. The index provider
then adjusts the value of the divisor as necessary to avoid changes in the index value
that are unrelated to changes in the prices of its constituent securities. For example,
when changing index constituents, the index provider may adjust the divisor so that
the value of the index with the new constituents equals the value of the index prior
to the changes.
    Index return calculations, like calculations of investment portfolio returns, may
measure price return or total return. Price return measures only price appreciation
or percentage change in price. Total return measures price appreciation plus interest,
dividends, and other distributions.


Calculation of Single-Period Returns
For a security market index, price return can be calculated in two ways: either the
percentage change in value of the price return index, or the weighted average of price
returns of the constituent securities. The price return of an index can be expressed as:
              ​VPRI1
                ​ ​− ​VPRI0
                       ​ ​
   	​PR​I​ = _
             ​ ​V​ ​ ​	                                                                  (2)
                     PRI0

where

     PRI = the price return of the index portfolio (as a decimal number, i.e., 12 per-
           cent is 0.12)

   VPRI1 = the value of the price return index at the end of the period

   VPRI0 = the value of the price return index at the beginning of the period
Similarly, the price return of each constituent security can be expressed as:
              ​Pi1
                ​ ​− ​Pi0
                       ​​
   	​PR​i​ = _
             ​ ​P​ ​ ​	                                                                  (3)

                         where

                            PRi = the price return of constituent security i (as a decimal number)

                             Pi1 = the price of constituent security i at the end of the period

                             Pi0 = the price of constituent security i at the beginning of the period
                         Because the price return of the index equals the weighted average of price returns of
                         the individual securities, we can write:
                                      N                N

                             Total return measures price appreciation plus interest, dividends, and other dis-
                         tributions. Thus, the total return of an index is the price appreciation, or change in
                         the value of the price return index, plus income (dividends and/or interest) over the
                         period, expressed as a percentage of the beginning value of the price return index.

    The total return of an index can also be calculated as the weighted average of total
returns of the constituent securities. The total return of each constituent security in
the index is calculated as:
            ​P1i
              ​ ​− ​P0i

   where

   TRi = the total return of constituent security i (as a decimal number)

    P1i = the price of constituent security i at the end of the period

    P0i = the price of constituent security i at the beginning of the period

   Inci = the total income (dividends and/or interest) from security i over the period
    Because the total return of an index can be calculated as the weighted average of
total returns of the constituent securities, we can express total return as:

   TRI = the total return of the index portfolio (as a decimal number)

   TRi = the total return of constituent security i (as a decimal number)

     wi = the weight of security i (the fraction of the index portfolio allocated to
          security i)

      N = the number of securities in the index



Calculation of Index Values over Multiple Time Periods
The calculation of index values over multiple time periods requires geometrically
linking the series of index returns. With a series of price returns for an index, we can
calculate the value of the price return index with the following equation:
   VPRIT = VPRI 0(1 + PRI 1)(1 + PRI 2)…(1 + PRIT)  	                              (10)
where

   VPRI 0 = the value of the price return index at inception

    VPRIT = the value of the price return index at time t

     PRIT = the price return (as a decimal number) on the index over period t, t = 1,
            2, …, T
   For an index with an inception value set to 1,000 and price returns of 5 percent
and 3 percent for Periods 1 and 2 respectively, the values of the price return index
would be calculated as follows:

                         Similarly, the series of total returns for an index is used to calculate the value of the
                         total return index with the following equation:
                            VTRIT = VTRI 0(1 + TRI 1)(1 + TRI 2)…(1 + TRIT)  	                               (11)
                         where

                            VTRI 0 = the value of the index at inception

                            VTRIT = the value of the total return index at time t

                             TRIT = the total return (as a decimal number) on the index over period t, t = 1, 2,
                                    …, T
                             Suppose that the same index yields an additional 1.5 percent return from income
                         in Period 1 and an additional 2.0 percent return from income in Period 2, bringing
                         the total returns for Periods 1 and 2, respectively, to 6.5 percent and 5 percent. The
                         values of the total return index would be calculated as follows:
                           Period         Return (%)                Calculation                Ending Value

                              0                                  1,000(1.00)                     1,000.00

                         As illustrated above, as time passes, the value of the total return index, which includes
                         the reinvestment of all dividends and/or interest received, exceeds the value of the
                         price return index by an increasing amount.

                         Constructing and managing a security market index is similar to constructing and
                         managing a portfolio of securities. Index providers must decide the following:
                            1. Which target market should the index represent?
                            2. Which securities should be selected from that target market?
                            3. How much weight should be allocated to each security in the index?
                            4. When should the index be rebalanced?
                            5. When should the security selection and weighting decision be re-examined?
Index Construction                                                                            87



Target Market and Security Selection
The first decision in index construction is identifying the target market, market seg-
ment, or asset class that the index is intended to represent. The target market may
be defined very broadly or narrowly. It may be based on asset class (e.g., equities,
fixed income, real estate, commodities, hedge funds); geographic region (e.g., Japan,
South Africa, Latin America, Europe); the exchange on which the securities are traded
(e.g., Shanghai, Toronto, Tokyo), and/or other characteristics (e.g., economic sector,
company size, investment style, duration, or credit quality).
    The target market determines the investment universe and the securities available
for inclusion in the index. Once the investment universe is identified, the number of
securities and the specific securities to include in the index must be determined. The
constituent securities could be nearly all those in the target market or a represen-
tative sample of the target market. Some equity indexes, such as the S&P 500 Index
and the FTSE 100, fix the number of securities included in the index and indicate
this number in the name of the index. Other indexes allow the number of securities
to vary to reflect changes in the target market or to maintain a certain percentage
of the target market. For example, the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) represents
and includes all of the largest stocks, known as the First Section, listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. To be included in the First Section—and thus the TOPIX—stocks
must meet certain criteria, such as the number of shares outstanding, the number of
shareholders, and market capitalization. Stocks that no longer meet the criteria are
removed from the First Section and also the TOPIX. Objective or mechanical rules
determine the constituent securities of most, but not all, indexes. The S&P Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, also called the S&P BSE SENSEX and the S&P 500,
for example, use a selection committee and more subjective decision-making rules
to determine constituent securities.


Index Weighting
The weighting decision determines how much of each security to include in the index
and has a substantial impact on an index’s value. Index providers use a number of
methods to weight the constituent securities in an index. Indexes can be price weighted,
equal weighted, market-capitalization weighted, or fundamentally weighted. Each
weighting method has its advantages and disadvantages.

Price Weighting
The simplest method to weight an index and the one used by Charles Dow to construct
the Dow Jones Industrial Average is price weighting. In price weighting, the weight
on each constituent security is determined by dividing its price by the sum of all the
prices of the constituent securities. The weight is calculated using the following formula:
               ​Pi​​
   	​w​iP​ ​ = _
               ​ N ​	                                                               (12)
             ​∑​Pi​​
             i=1

Exhibit 1 illustrates the values, weights, and single-period returns following incep-
tion of a price-weighted equity index with five constituent securities. The value of
the price-weighted index is determined by dividing the sum of the security values
(101.50) by the divisor, which is typically set at inception to equal the initial number
of securities in the index. Thus, in our example, the divisor is 5 and the initial value
of the index is calculated as 101.50 ÷ 5 = 20.30.
                                                                                                                                                       88

As illustrated in this exhibit, Security A, which has the highest price, also has the
highest weighting and thus will have the greatest impact on the return of the index.
Note how both the price return and the total return of the index are calculated on
the basis of the corresponding returns on the constituent securities.
     A property unique to price-weighted indexes is that a stock split on one constit-
uent security changes the weights on all the securities in the index.1 To prevent the
stock split and the resulting new weights from changing the value of the index, the
index provider must adjust the value of the divisor as illustrated in Exhibit 2. Given
a 2-for-1 split in Security A, the divisor is adjusted by dividing the sum of the con-
stituent prices after the split (77.50) by the value of the index before the split (21.00).
This adjustment results in changing the divisor from 5 to 3.69 so that the index value
is maintained at 21.00.
     The primary advantage of price weighting is its simplicity. The main disadvantage
of price weighting is that it results in arbitrary weights for each security. In particu-
lar, a stock split in any one security causes arbitrary changes in the weights of all the
constituents’ securities.

Equal Weighting
Another simple index weighting method is equal weighting. This method assigns an
equal weight to each constituent security at inception. The weights are calculated as:

                ​N1 ​	
     	​w​Ei​​ = _                                                                                   (13)

where

     wi = fraction of the portfolio that is allocated to security i or weight of security i

      N = number of securities in the index
    To construct an equal-weighted index from the five securities in Exhibit 1, the index
provider allocates one-fifth (20 percent) of the value of the index (at the beginning
of the period) to each security. Dividing the value allocated to each security by each
security’s individual share price determines the number of shares of each security to
include in the index. Unlike a price-weighted index, where the weights are arbitrarily
determined by the market prices, the weights in an equal-weighted index are arbitrarily
assigned by the index provider.


1 A stock split is an increase in the number of shares outstanding and a proportionate decrease in the
price per share such that the total market value of equity, as well as investors’ proportionate ownership in
the company, does not change.

                             Exhibit 3 illustrates the values, weights, and single-period returns following
                         inception of an equal-weighted index with the same constituent securities as those
                         in Exhibit 1. This example assumes a beginning index portfolio value of 10,000 (i.e.,
                         an investment of 2,000 in each security). To set the initial value of the index to 1,000,
                         the divisor is set to 10 (10,000 ÷ 10 = 1,000).
                         Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 3 demonstrate how different weighting methods result in dif-
                         ferent returns. The 10.4 percent price return of the equal-weighted index shown in
                         Exhibit 3 differs significantly from the 3.45 percent price return of the price-weighted
                         index in Exhibit 1.
                             Like price weighting, the primary advantage of equal weighting is its simplicity.
                         Equal weighting, however, has a number of disadvantages. First, securities that con-
                         stitute the largest fraction of the target market value are underrepresented, and secu-
                         rities that constitute a small fraction of the target market value are overrepresented.
                         Second, after the index is constructed and the prices of constituent securities change,
                         the index is no longer equally weighted. Therefore, maintaining equal weights requires
                         frequent adjustments (rebalancing) to the index.

                         Market-Capitalization Weighting
                         In market-capitalization weighting, or value weighting, the weight on each constit-
                         uent security is determined by dividing its market capitalization by the total market
                         capitalization (the sum of the market capitalization) of all the securities in the index.
                         Market capitalization or value is calculated by multiplying the number of shares out-
                         standing by the market price per share.
                             The market-capitalization weight of security i is:
                                      ​Q​i​​P​i​
                                       _
                            	​w​M
                                i​ ​ = ​N ​	                                                                  (14)
                                    ​∑​Q​j​​P​j​

                            where

                            wi = fraction of the portfolio that is allocated to security i or weight of security i

                            Qi = number of shares outstanding of security i

                             Pi = share price of security i

                             N = number of securities in the index
                             Exhibit 4 illustrates the values, weights, and single-period returns following
                         inception of a market-capitalization-weighted index for the same five-security market.
                         Security A, with 3,000 shares outstanding and a price of 50 per share, has a market
                         capitalization of 150,000 or 26.29 percent (150,000/570,500) of the entire index
                         portfolio. The resulting index weights in the exhibit reflect the relative value of each
                         security as measured by its market capitalization.
                         As shown in Exhibit 1, Exhibit 3, and Exhibit 4, the weighting method affects the
                         index’s returns. The price and total returns of the market-capitalization index in Exhibit
                         4 (1.49 percent and 2.13 percent, respectively) differ significantly from those of the
                         price-weighted (3.45 percent and 4.33 percent, respectively) and equal-weighted (10.40
                         percent and 10.88 percent respectively) indexes. To understand the source and mag-
                         nitude of the difference, compare the weights and returns of each security under each
                         of the weighting methods. The weight of Security A, for example, ranges from 49.26
                         percent in the price-weighted index to 20 percent in the equal-weighted index. With
                         a price return of 10 percent, Security A contributes 4.93 percent to the price return of
                         the price-weighted index, 2.00 percent to the price return of the equal-weighted index,
                         and 2.63 percent to the price return of the market-capitalization-weighted index. With

Float-Adjusted Market-Capitalization Weighting
In float-adjusted market-capitalization weighting, the weight on each constituent
security is determined by adjusting its market capitalization for its market float.
Typically, market float is the number of shares of the constituent security that are
available to the investing public. For companies that are closely held, only a portion of
the shares outstanding are available to the investing public (the rest are held by a small
group of controlling investors). In addition to excluding shares held by controlling
shareholders, most float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted indexes also exclude
shares held by other corporations and governments. Some providers of indexes that
are designed to represent the investment opportunities of global investors further
reduce the number of shares included in the index by excluding shares that are not
available to foreigner investors. The index providers may refer to these indexes as
“free-float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted indexes.”
    Float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted indexes reflect the shares available
for public trading by multiplying the market price per share by the number of shares
available to the investing public (i.e., the float-adjusted market capitalization) rather
than the total number of shares outstanding (total market capitalization). Currently,
most market-capitalization-weighted indexes are float adjusted. Therefore, unless oth-
erwise indicated, for the remainder of this reading, “market-capitalization” weighting
refers to float-adjusted market-capitalization weighting.
    The float-adjusted market-capitalization weight of security i is calculated as:
              ​f​i​​Q​i​​P​i​
              _
   	​w​M
       i​ ​ = ​N ​	                                                                  (15)
           ​∑​f​j​​Q​j​​P​j​
           j=1

   where

    fi = fraction of shares outstanding in the market float

   wi = fraction of the portfolio that is allocated to security i or weight of security i

   Qi = number of shares outstanding of security i

    Pi = share price of security i

    N = number of securities in the index
    Exhibit 5 illustrates the values, weights, and single-period returns following incep-
tion of a float-adjusted market-capitalization-weighted equity index using the same
five securities as before. The low percentage of shares of Security D in the market
float compared with the number of shares outstanding indicates that the security is
closely held.
The primary advantage of market-capitalization weighting (including float adjusted)
is that constituent securities are held in proportion to their value in the target mar-
ket. The primary disadvantage is that constituent securities whose prices have risen
the most (or fallen the most) have a greater (or lower) weight in the index (i.e., as
a security’s price rises relative to other securities in the index, its weight increases;
and as its price decreases in value relative to other securities in the index, its weight
decreases). This weighting method leads to overweighting stocks that have risen in price
(and may be overvalued) and underweighting stocks that have declined in price (and
may be undervalued). The effect of this weighting method is similar to a momentum
investment strategy in that over time, the securities that have risen in price the most
will have the largest weights in the index.
                                                                                                                                                                 94

Fundamental Weighting
Fundamental weighting attempts to address the disadvantages of market-capitaliza-
tion weighting by using measures of a company’s size that are independent of its
security price to determine the weight on each constituent security. These measures
include book value, cash flow, revenues, earnings, dividends, and number of employees.
    Some fundamental indexes use a single measure, such as total dividends, to weight
the constituent securities, whereas others combine the weights from several measures
to form a composite value that is used for weighting.
    Letting Fi denote a given fundamental size measure of company i, the fundamental
weight on security i is:
              ​F​i​
   	​w​Fi​​ = _
              ​ N ​	                                                             (16)
            ​∑​F​j​
             j=1

Relative to a market-capitalization-weighted index, a fundamental index with weights
based on such an item as earnings will result in greater weights on constituent securi-
ties with earnings yields (earnings divided by price) that are higher than the earnings
yield of the overall market-weighted portfolio. Similarly, stocks with earnings yields
less than the yield on the overall market-weighted portfolio will have lower weights.
For example, suppose there are two stocks in an index. Stock A has a market capital-
ization of €200 million, Stock B has a market capitalization of €800 million, and their
aggregate market capitalization is €1 billion (€1,000 million). Both companies have
earnings of €20 million and aggregate earnings of €40 million. Thus, Stock A has an
earnings yield of 10 percent (20/200) and Stock B has an earnings yield of 2.5 percent
(20/800). The earnings weight of Stock A is 50 percent (20/40), which is higher than
its market-capitalization weight of 20 percent (200/1,000). The earnings weight of
Stock B is 50 percent (20/40), which is less than its market-capitalization weight of 80
percent (800/1,000). Relative to the market-cap-weighted index, the earnings-weighted
index over-weights the high-yield Stock A and under-weights the low-yield Stock B.
    The most important property of fundamental weighting is that it leads to
indexes that have a “value” tilt. That is, a fundamentally weighted index has ratios
of book value, earnings, dividends, etc. to market value that are higher than its
market-capitalization-weighted counterpart. Also, in contrast to the momentum
“effect” of market-capitalization-weighted indexes, fundamentally weighted indexes
generally will have a contrarian “effect” in that the portfolio weights will shift away
from securities that have increased in relative value and toward securities that have
fallen in relative value whenever the portfolio is rebalanced.




INDEX MANAGEMENT: REBALANCING AND
RECONSTITUTION                                                                             4
                   describe rebalancing and reconstitution of an index

So far, we have discussed index construction. Index management entails the two
remaining questions:
   ■    When should the index be rebalanced?
   ■    When should the security selection and weighting decisions be
        re-examined?
96   Learning Module 2                                                                    Security Market Indexes



                         Rebalancing
                         Rebalancing refers to adjusting the weights of the constituent securities in the index.
                         To maintain the weight of each security consistent with the index’s weighting method,
                         the index provider rebalances the index by adjusting the weights of the constituent
                         securities on a regularly scheduled basis (rebalancing dates)—usually quarterly.
                         Rebalancing is necessary because the weights of the constituent securities change
                         as their market prices change. Note, for example, that the weights of the securities
                         in the equal-weighted index (Exhibit 3) at the end of the period are no longer equal
                         (i.e., 20 percent):
                                  Security A                                 19.93%
                                  Security B                                 15.94
                                  Security C                                 11.60
                                  Security D                                 25.36
                                  Security E                                 27.17

                         In rebalancing the index, the weights of Securities D and E (which had the highest
                         returns) would be decreased and the weights of Securities A, B, and C (which had the
                         lowest returns) would be increased. Thus, rebalancing creates turnover within an index.
                             Price-weighted indexes are not rebalanced because the weight of each constitu-
                         ent security is determined by its price. For market-capitalization-weighted indexes,
                         rebalancing is less of a concern because the indexes largely rebalance themselves. In
                         our market-capitalization index, for example, the weight of Security C automatically
                         declined from 10.96 percent to 6.91 percent, reflecting the 36 percent decline in its
                         market price. Market-capitalization weights are only adjusted to reflect mergers,
                         acquisitions, liquidations, and other corporate actions between rebalancing dates.


                         Reconstitution
                         Reconstitution is the process of changing the constituent securities in an index. It is
                         similar to a portfolio manager deciding to change the securities in his or her port-
                         folio. Reconstitution is part of the rebalancing cycle. The reconstitution date is the
                         date on which index providers review the constituent securities, re-apply the initial
                         criteria for inclusion in the index, and select which securities to retain, remove, or
                         add. Constituent securities that no longer meet the criteria are replaced with securities
                         that do meet the criteria. Once the revised list of constituent securities is determined,
                         the weighting method is re-applied. Indexes are reconstituted to reflect changes in the
                         target market (bankruptcies, de-listings, mergers, acquisitions, etc.) and/or to reflect
                         the judgment of the selection committee.
                              Reconstitution creates turnover in a number of different ways, particularly for
                         market-capitalization-weighted indexes. When one security is removed and another
                         is added, the index provider has to change the weights of the other securities in order
                         to maintain the market-capitalization weighting of the index.
                              The frequency of reconstitution is a major issue for widely used indexes and their
                         constituent securities. The Russell 2000 Index, for example, reconstitutes annually.
                         It is used as a benchmark by numerous investment funds, and each year, prior to
                         the index’s reconstitution, the managers of these funds buy stocks they think will be
                         added to the index—driving those stocks’ prices up—and sell stocks they think will
                         be deleted from the index—driving those stocks’ prices down. Exhibit 6 illustrates a
                         historical example of the potential impact of these decisions. Beginning in late April
                         2009, some managers began acquiring and bidding up the price of Uranium Energy
                         Corporation (UEC) because they believed that it would be included in the reconsti-
                         tuted Russell 2000 Index. On 12 June, Russell listed UEC as a preliminary addition to
Uses of Market Indexes                                                                                      97


the Russell 2000 Index and the Russell 3000 Index.2 By that time, the stock value had
increased by more than 300 percent. Investors continued to bid up the stock price in
the weeks following the announcement, and the stock closed on the reconstitution
date of 30 June at USD2.90, up nearly 400 percent for the quarter.

USES OF MARKET INDEXES
                                                                                                        5
                      describe uses of security market indexes

Indexes were initially created to give a sense of how a particular security market
performed on a given day. With the development of modern financial theory, their
uses in investment management have expanded significantly. Some of the major uses
of indexes include:
     ■          gauges of market sentiment;
     ■          proxies for measuring and modeling returns, systematic risk, and
                risk-adjusted performance;
     ■          proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models;
     ■          benchmarks for actively managed portfolios; and
     ■          model portfolios for such investment products as index funds and
                exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

                             Investors using security market indexes must be familiar with how various indexes
                         are constructed in order to select the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs.


                         Gauges of Market Sentiment
                         The original purpose of stock market indexes was to provide a gauge of investor
                         confidence or market sentiment. As indicators of the collective opinion of market
                         participants, indexes reflect investor attitudes and behavior. The Dow Jones Industrial
                         Average has a long history, is frequently quoted in the media, and remains a popular
                         gauge of market sentiment. It may not accurately reflect the overall attitude of inves-
                         tors or the “market,” however, because the index consists of only 30 of the thousands
                         of US stocks traded each day.


                         Proxies for Measuring and Modeling Returns, Systematic Risk,
                         and Risk-Adjusted Performance
                         The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) defines beta as the systematic risk of a security
                         with respect to the entire market. The market portfolio in the CAPM consists of all
                         risky securities. To represent the performance of the market portfolio, investors use
                         a broad index. For example, the Tokyo Price Index (TOPIX) and the S&P 500 often
                         serve as proxies for the market portfolio in Japan and the United States, respectively,
                         and are used for measuring and modeling systematic risk and market returns.
                             Security market indexes also serve as market proxies when measuring risk-adjusted
                         performance. The beta of an actively managed portfolio allows investors to form a
                         passive alternative with the same level of systematic risk. For example, if the beta of
                         an actively managed portfolio of global stocks is 0.95 with respect to the MSCI World
                         Index, investors can create a passive portfolio with the same systematic risk by investing
                         95 percent of their portfolio in a MSCI World Index fund and holding the remaining
                         5 percent in cash. Alpha, the difference between the return of the actively managed
                         portfolio and the return of the passive portfolio, is a measure of risk-adjusted return
                         or investment performance. Alpha can be the result of manager skill (or lack thereof ),
                         transaction costs, and fees.


                         Proxies for Asset Classes in Asset Allocation Models
                         Because indexes exhibit the risk and return profiles of select groups of securities, they
                         play a critical role as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models. They provide
                         the historical data used to model the risks and returns of different asset classes.


                         Benchmarks for Actively Managed Portfolios
                         Investors often use indexes as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of active
                         portfolio managers. The index selected as the benchmark should reflect the invest-
                         ment strategy used by the manager. For example, an active manager investing in
                         global small-capitalization stocks should be evaluated using a benchmark index,
                         such as the FTSE Global Small Cap Index, which includes approximately 4,400 liquid
                         small-capitalization stocks across 47 countries as of August 2018.
                            The choice of an index to use as a benchmark is important because an inappropriate
                         index could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding an active manager’s investment
                         performance. Suppose that the small-cap manager underperformed the small-cap
                         index but outperformed a broad equity market index. If investors use the broad market
Equity indexes                                                                                                  99


index as a benchmark, they might conclude that the small-cap manager is earning
his or her fees and should be retained or given additional assets to invest. Using the
small-cap index as a benchmark might lead to a very different conclusion.


Model Portfolios for Investment Products
Indexes also serve as the basis for the development of new investment products.
Using indexes as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios has led some investors
to conclude that they should invest in the benchmarks instead. Based on the CAPM’s
conclusion that investors should hold the market portfolio, broad market index funds
have been developed to function as proxies for the market portfolio.
    Investment management firms initially developed and managed index portfolios
for institutional investors. Eventually, mutual fund companies introduced index funds
for individual investors. Subsequently, investment management firms introduced
exchange-traded funds, which are managed the same way as index mutual funds but
trade like stocks.
    The first ETFs were based on existing indexes. As the popularity of ETFs increased,
index providers created new indexes for the specific purpose of forming ETFs, leading
to the creation of numerous narrowly defined indexes with corresponding ETFs. The
VanEck Vectors Vietnam ETF, for example, allows investors to invest in the equity
market of Vietnam.
    The choice of indexes to meet the needs of investors is extensive. Index providers are
constantly looking for opportunities to develop indexes to meet the needs of investors.

A wide variety of equity indexes exist, including broad market, multi-market, sector,
and style indexes.


Broad Market Indexes
A broad equity market index, as its name suggests, represents an entire given equity
market and typically includes securities representing more than 90 percent of the
selected market. For example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE)
is a market-capitalization-weighted index of all shares that trade on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange. In the United States, the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index is a
market-capitalization-weighted index that includes all US equities with readily available
prices and is designed to represent the entire US equity market.3 The Russell 3000,
consisting of the largest 3,000 stocks by market capitalization, represents approximately
98 percent of the US equity market.




3 Despite its name, the Wilshire 5000 has no constraint on the number of securities that can be included.
It included approximately 5,000 securities at inception.

                                   Multi-Market Indexes
                                   Multi-market indexes usually comprise indexes from different countries and regions
                                   and are designed to represent multiple security markets. Multi-market indexes may
                                   represent multiple national markets, geographic regions, economic development
                                   groups, and, in some cases, the entire world. World indexes are of importance to
                                   investors who take a global approach to equity investing without any particular bias
                                   toward a particular country or region. A number of index providers publish families
                                   of multi-market equity indexes.
                                       MSCI offers a number of multi-market indexes. As shown in Exhibit 7, MSCI
                                   classifies countries and regions along two dimensions: level of economic develop-
                                   ment and geographic region. Developmental groups, which MSCI refers to as market
                                   classifications, include developed markets, emerging markets, and frontier markets.
                                   The geographic regions are largely divided by longitudinal lines of the globe: the
                                   Americas, Europe with Africa, and Asia with the Pacific. MSCI provides country- and
                                   region-specific indexes for each of the developed and emerging markets within its
                                   multi-market indexes. MSCI periodically reviews the classifications of markets in its
                                   indexes for movement from frontier markets to emerging markets and from emerging
                                   markets to developed markets and reconstitutes the indexes accordingly.

Fundamental Weighting in Multi-Market Indexes
Some index providers weight the securities within each country/region by market
capitalization and then weight each country/region in the overall index in proportion
to its relative GDP, effectively creating fundamental weighting in multi-market indexes.
GDP-weighted indexes were some of the first fundamentally weighted indexes created.
Introduced in 1987 by MSCI to address the 60 percent weight of Japanese equities
in the market-capitalization-weighted MSCI EAFE Index at the time, GDP-weighted
indexes reduced the allocation to Japanese equities by half.4


Sector Indexes
Sector indexes represent and track different economic sectors—such as consumer
goods, energy, finance, health care, and technology—on either a national, regional,
or global basis. Because different sectors of the economy behave differently over the
course of the business cycle, some investors may seek to overweight or underweight
their exposure to particular sectors.
    Sector indexes are organized as families; each index within the family represents
an economic sector. Typically, the aggregation of a sector index family is equivalent
to a broad market index. Economic sector classification can be applied on a global,
regional, or country-specific basis, but no universally agreed upon sector classification
method exists.
    Sector indexes play an important role in performance analysis because they provide
a means to determine whether a portfolio manager is more successful at stock selection
or sector allocation. Sector indexes also serve as model portfolios for sector-specific
ETFs and other investment products.


Style Indexes
Style indexes represent groups of securities classified according to market capital-
ization, value, growth, or a combination of these characteristics. They are intended
to reflect the investing styles of certain investors, such as the growth investor, value
investor, and small-cap investor.

Market Capitalization
Market-capitalization indexes represent securities categorized according to the major
capitalization categories: large cap, midcap, and small cap. With no universal definition
of these categories, the indexes differ on the distinctions between large cap and midcap
and between midcap and small cap, as well as the minimum market-capitalization
size required to be included in a small-cap index. Classification into categories can be
based on absolute market capitalization (e.g., below €100 million) or relative market
capitalization (e.g., the smallest 2,500 stocks).

                          Value/Growth Classification
                          Some indexes represent categories of stocks based on their classifications as either
                          value or growth stocks. Different index providers use different factors and valuation
                          ratios (low price-to-book ratios, low price-to-earnings ratios, high dividend yields,
                          etc.) to distinguish between value and growth equities.

                          Market Capitalization and Value/Growth Classification
                          Combining the three market-capitalization groups with value and growth classifica-
                          tions results in six basic style index categories:
                          ■   Large-Cap Value                               ■   Large-Cap Growth
                          ■   Mid-Cap Value                                 ■   Mid-Cap Growth
                          ■   Small-Cap Value                               ■   Small-Cap Growth

                          Because indexes use different size and valuation classifications, the constituents of
                          indexes designed to represent a given style, such as small-cap value, may differ—
                          sometimes substantially.
                              Because valuation ratios and market capitalizations change over time, stocks
                          frequently migrate from one style index category to another on reconstitution dates.
                          As a result, style indexes generally have much higher turnover than do broad market
                          indexes.

                          A wide variety of fixed-income indexes exists, but the nature of the fixed-income
                          markets and fixed-income securities leads to some very important challenges to
                          fixed-income index construction and replication. These challenges are the number
                          of securities in the fixed-income universe, the availability of pricing data, and the

                          agencies, and corporations. Each of these entities may issue a variety of fixed-income
                          securities with different characteristics. As a result, the number of fixed-income
                          securities is many times larger than the number of equity securities. To represent a
                          specific fixed-income market or segment, indexes may include thousands of different
                          securities. Over time, these fixed-income securities mature, and issuers offer new
                          securities to meet their financing needs, leading to turnover in fixed-income indexes.
                              Another challenge in index construction is that fixed-income markets are pre-
                          dominantly dealer markets. This means that firms (dealers) are assigned to specific
                          securities and are responsible for creating liquid markets for those securities by pur-
                          chasing and selling them from their inventory. In addition, many securities do not
                          trade frequently and, as a result, are relatively illiquid. As a result, index providers
Fixed-income indexes                                                                                            103


must contact dealers to obtain current prices on constituent securities to update the
index or they must estimate the prices of constituent securities using the prices of
traded fixed-income securities with similar characteristics.
    These challenges can result in indexes with dissimilar numbers of bonds repre-
senting the same markets. The large number of fixed-income securities—combined
with the lack of liquidity of some securities—has made it more costly and difficult,
compared with equity indexes, for investors to replicate fixed-income indexes and
duplicate their performance.


Types of Fixed-Income Indexes
The wide variety of fixed-income securities, ranging from zero-coupon bonds to
bonds with embedded options (i.e., callable or putable bonds), results in a number of
different types of fixed-income indexes. Similar to equities, fixed-income securities
can be categorized according to the issuer’s economic sector, the issuer’s geographic
region, or the economic development of the issuer’s geographic region. Fixed-income
securities can also be classified along the following dimensions:
    ■    type of issuer (government, government agency, corporation);
    ■    type of financing (general obligation, collateralized);
    ■    currency of payments;
    ■    maturity;
    ■    credit quality (investment grade, high yield, credit agency ratings); and
    ■    absence or presence of inflation protection.
    Fixed-income indexes are based on these various dimensions and can be catego-
rized as follows:
    ■    aggregate or broad market indexes;
    ■    market sector indexes;
    ■    style indexes;
    ■    economic sector indexes; and
    ■    specialized indexes such as high-yield, inflation-linked, and emerging mar-
         ket indexes.
    The first fixed-income index created, the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate
Bond Index (formerly the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index), is an example
of a single-country aggregate index. Designed to represent the broad market of US
fixed-income securities, it comprises approximately 8,000 securities, including US
Treasury, government-related, corporate, mortgage-backed, asset-backed, and com-
mercial mortgage-backed securities.
    Aggregate indexes can be subdivided by market sector (government, government
agency, collateralized, corporate); style (maturity, credit quality); economic sector, or
some other characteristic to create more narrowly defined indexes. A common dis-
tinction reflected in indexes is between investment grade (e.g., those with a Standard
& Poor’s credit rating of BBB– or better) and high-yield securities. Investment-grade
indexes are typically further subdivided by maturity (i.e., short, intermediate, or
long) and by credit rating (e.g., AAA, BBB, etc.).5 The wide variety of fixed-income
indexes reflects the partitioning of fixed-income securities on the basis of a variety
of dimensions.
    Exhibit 8 illustrates how the major types of fixed-income indexes can be organized
on the basis of various dimensions.

INDEXES FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
                                                                                                      8

Many investors seek to lower the risk or enhance the performance of their portfolios
by investing in assets classes other than equities and fixed income. Interest in alter-
native assets and investment strategies has led to the creation of indexes designed to
represent broad classes of alternative investments. Three of the most widely followed
alternative investment classes are commodities, real estate, and hedge funds.


Commodity Indexes
Commodity indexes consist of futures contracts on one or more commodities, such
as agricultural products (rice, wheat, sugar), livestock (cattle, hogs), precious and
common metals (gold, silver, copper), and energy commodities (crude oil, natural gas).
    Although some commodity indexes may include the same commodities, the
returns of these indexes may differ because each index may use a different weighting
method. Because commodity indexes do not have an obvious weighting mechanism,
such as market capitalization, commodity index providers create their own weighting
methods. Some indexes, such as the Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index
(TR/CC CRB Index), formerly known as the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB)
Index, contain a fixed number of commodities that are weighted equally. The S&P
106   Learning Module 2                                                                    Security Market Indexes


                          GSCI uses a combination of liquidity measures and world production values in its
                          weighting scheme and allocates more weight to commodities that have risen in price.
                          Other indexes have fixed weights that are determined by a committee.
                              The different weighting methods can also lead to large differences in exposure to
                          specific commodities. The S&P GSCI in 2018, for example, weights the energy-sector
                          approximately 50% higher and the agriculture sector 40% lower than the CRB Index.
                          These differences result in indexes with very different risk and return profiles. Unlike
                          commodity indexes, broad equity and fixed-income indexes that target the same
                          markets share similar risk and return profiles.
                              The performance of commodity indexes can also be quite different from their under-
                          lying commodities because the indexes consist of futures contracts on the commodities
                          rather than the actual commodities. Index returns are affected by factors other than
                          changes in the prices of the underlying commodities because futures contracts must
                          be continually “rolled over” (i.e., replacing a contract nearing expiration with a new
                          contract). Commodity index returns reflect the risk-free interest rate, the changes in
                          future prices, and the roll yield. Therefore, a commodity index return can be quite
                          different from the return based on changes in the prices of the underlying commodities.


                          Real Estate Investment Trust Indexes
                          Real estate indexes represent not only the market for real estate securities but also the
                          market for real estate—a highly illiquid market and asset class with infrequent trans-
                          actions and pricing information. Real estate indexes can be categorized as appraisal
                          indexes, repeat sales indexes, and real estate investment trust (REIT) indexes.
                              REIT indexes consist of shares of publicly traded REITs. REITS are public or private
                          corporations organized specifically to invest in real estate, either through ownership
                          of properties or investment in mortgages. Shares of public REITs are traded on the
                          world’s various stock exchanges and are a popular choice for investing in commercial
                          real estate properties. Because REIT indexes are based on publicly traded REITs with
                          continuous market pricing, the value of REIT indexes is calculated continuously.

Hedge Fund Indexes
Hedge fund indexes reflect the returns on hedge funds. Hedge funds are private
investment vehicles that typically use leverage and long and short investment strategies.
     A number of research organizations maintain databases of hedge fund returns
and summarize these returns into indexes. These database indexes are designed to
represent the performance of the hedge funds on a very broad global level (hedge
funds in general) or the strategy level. Most of these indexes are equal weighted and
represent the performance of the hedge funds within a particular database.
     Most research organizations rely on the voluntary cooperation of hedge funds
to compile performance data. As unregulated entities, however, hedge funds are not
required to report their performance to any party other than their investors. Therefore,
each hedge fund decides to which database(s) it will report its performance. As a
result, rather than index providers determining the constituents, the constituents
determine the index.
     Frequently, a hedge fund reports its performance to only one database. The result
is little overlap of funds covered by the different indexes. With little overlap between
their constituents, different global hedge fund indexes may reflect very different per-
formance for the hedge fund industry over the same period of time.
     Another consequence of the voluntary performance reporting is the potential
for survivorship bias and, therefore, inaccurate performance representation. This
means that hedge funds with poor performance may be less likely to report their
performance to the database or may stop reporting to the database, so their returns
may be excluded when measuring the return of the index. As a result, the index may
not accurately reflect actual hedge fund performance so much as the performance of
hedge funds that are performing well.

                                        As indicated in this reading, the choice of indexes to meet the needs of investors
                                        is extensive. Investors using security market indexes must be careful in their
                                        selection of the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs. The following

    SUMMARY
This reading explains and illustrates the construction, management, and uses of security
market indexes. It also discusses various types of indexes. Security market indexes
are invaluable tools for investors, who can select from among thousands of indexes
representing a variety of security markets, market segments, and asset classes. These
indexes range from those representing the global market for major asset classes to
those representing alternative investments in specific geographic markets. To benefit
from the use of security market indexes, investors must understand their construction
and determine whether the selected index is appropriate for their purposes. Frequently,
an index that is well suited for one purpose may not be well suited for other purposes.
Users of indexes must be familiar with how various indexes are constructed in order
to select the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs.
    Among the key points made in this reading are the following:
    ■   Security market indexes are intended to measure the values of different tar-
        get markets (security markets, market segments, or asset classes).
    ■   The constituent securities selected for inclusion in the security market index
        are intended to represent the target market.
    ■   A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities.
    ■   A total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities
        but also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the
        index.

                          ■   Methods used to weight the constituents of an index range from the very
                              simple, such as price and equal weightings, to the more complex, such as
                              market-capitalization and fundamental weightings.
                          ■   Choices in index construction—in particular, the choice of weighting
                              method—affect index valuation and returns.
                          ■   Index management includes 1) periodic rebalancing to ensure that the index
                              maintains appropriate weightings and 2) reconstitution to ensure the index
                              represents the desired target market.
                          ■   Rebalancing and reconstitution create turnover in an index. Reconstitution
                              can dramatically affect prices of current and prospective constituents.
                          ■   Indexes serve a variety of purposes. They gauge market sentiment and serve
                              as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios. They act as proxies for
                              measuring systematic risk and risk-adjusted performance. They also serve as
                              proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models and as model portfolios
                              for investment products.
                          ■   Investors can choose from security market indexes representing various
                              asset classes, including equity, fixed-income, commodity, real estate, and
                              hedge fund indexes.
                          ■   Within most asset classes, index providers offer a wide variety of indexes,
                              ranging from broad market indexes to highly specialized indexes based on
                              the issuer’s geographic region, economic development group, or economic
                              sector or other factors.
                          ■   Proper use of security market indexes depends on understanding their con-
                              struction and management.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. C is correct. A security market index represents the value of a given security
                             market, market segment, or asset class.

                          2. C is correct. The difference between a price return index and a total return index
                             consisting of identical securities and weights is the income generated over time
                             by the underlying securities. If the securities in the index do not generate income,
                             both indexes will be identical in value.

                          3. A is correct. At inception, the values of the price return and total return versions
                             of an index are equal.

                          4. A is correct. Security market indexes are constructed and managed like a portfo-

                          5. A is correct. The first decision is identifying the target market that the index is
                             intended to represent because the target market determines the investment uni-
                             verse and the securities available for inclusion in the index.

                          6. B is correct. The price return is the sum of the weighted returns of each security.
                             The return of Able is 20 percent [(12 – 10)/10]; of Baker is –5 percent [(19 –
                             20)/20]; and of Charlie is 0 percent [(30 – 30)/30]. The price return index assigns
                             a weight of 1/3 to each asset; therefore, the price return is 1/3 × [20% + (–5%) +
                             0%] = 5%.

                          7. C is correct. The total return of an index is calculated on the basis of the change
                             in price of the underlying securities plus the sum of income received or the sum
                             of the weighted total returns of each security. The total return of Able is 27.5
                             percent; of Baker is 0 percent; and of Charlie is 6.7 percent:

                                 Able: (12 – 10 + 0.75)/10 = 27.5%
                                 Baker: (19 – 20 + 1)/20 = 0%
                                 Charlie: (30 – 30 + 2)/30 = 6.7%
                             An equal-weighted index applies the same weight (1/3) to each security’s return;
                             therefore, the total return = 1/3 × (27.5% + 0% + 6.7%) = 11.4%.

                          8. B is correct. The price return of the price-weighted index is the percentage
                             change in price of the index: (68 – 75)/75 = –9.33%.

                          9. B is correct. The price return of the index is (48,250,000 – 53,750,000)/53,750,000
                             = –10.23%.

11. A is correct. The target market determines the investment universe and the secu-
    rities available for inclusion in the index.

12. A is correct. The sum of prices at the beginning of the period is 96; the sum at the
    end of the period is 100. Regardless of the divisor, the price return is 100/96 – 1 =
    0.042 or 4.2 percent.

13. B is correct. It is the percentage change in the market value over the period:

          Market value at beginning of period: (20 × 300) + (50 × 300) + (26 × 2,000)
          = 73,000
          Market value at end of period: (22 × 300) + (48 × 300) + (30 × 2,000) =
          81,000
          Percentage change is 81,000/73,000 – 1 = 0.1096 or 11.0 percent with
          rounding.

14. C is correct. With an equal-weighted index, the same amount is invested in each
    security. Assuming $1,000 is invested in each of the three stocks, the index value
    is $3,000 at the beginning of the period and the following number of shares is
    purchased for each stock:

          Security A: 50 shares
          Security B: 20 shares
          Security C: 38.46 shares.
   Using the prices at the beginning of the period for each security, the index value
   at the end of the period is $3,213.8: ($22 × 50) + ($48 × 20) + ($30 × 38.46). The
   price return is $3,213.8/$3,000 – 1 = 7.1%.

15. A is correct. In the price weighting method, the divisor must be adjusted so the
    index value immediately after the split is the same as the index value immediately
    prior to the split.

16. C is correct. The main source of return differences arises from outperformance
120   Learning Module 2                                                                      Security Market Indexes


                             of small-cap securities or underperformance of large-cap securities. In an
                             equal-weighted index, securities that constitute the largest fraction of the market
                             are underrepresented and securities that constitute only a small fraction of the
                             market are overrepresented. Thus, higher equal-weighted index returns will oc-
                             cur if the smaller-cap equities outperform the larger-cap equities.

                          17. C is correct. “Float” is the number of shares available for public trading.

                          18. B is correct. Fundamental weighting leads to indexes that have a value tilt.

                          19. C is correct. Rebalancing refers to adjusting the weights of constituent securities
                              in an index to maintain consistency with the index’s weighting method.

                          20. B is correct. Changing market prices will cause weights that were initially equal
                              to become unequal, thus requiring rebalancing.

                          21. C is correct. Reconstitution is the process by which index providers review the
                              constituent securities, re-apply the initial criteria for inclusion in the index, and
                              select which securities to retain, remove, or add. Constituent securities that no
                              longer meet the criteria are replaced with securities that do. Thus, reconstitution
                              reduces the likelihood that the index includes securities that are not representa-
                              tive of the target market.

                          22. C is correct. Security market indexes play a critical role as proxies for asset class-
                              es in asset allocation models.

                          23. A is correct. Security market indexes are used as proxies for measuring market or
                              systematic risk, not as measures of systemic risk.

                          24. B is correct. Sector indexes provide a means to determine whether a portfolio
                              manager is more successful at stock selection or sector allocation.

                          25. C is correct. Style indexes represent groups of securities classified according to
                              market capitalization, value, growth, or a combination of these characteristics.

                          26. A is correct. The large number of fixed-income securities—combined with the
                              lack of liquidity of some securities—makes it costly and difficult for investors to
                              replicate fixed-income indexes.

                          27. C is correct. An aggregate fixed-income index can be subdivided by market
                              sector (government, government agency, collateralized, corporate), style (matu-
                              rity, credit quality), economic sector, or some other characteristic to create more
                              narrowly defined indexes.

                          28. C is correct. Coupon frequency is not a dimension on which fixed-income index-
                              es are based.

                          29. C is correct. The fixed-income market has more issuers and securities than the
                              equity market.

                          30. A is correct. Commodity indexes consist of futures contracts on one or more
                              commodities.

                          31. C is correct. The performance of commodity indexes can be quite different from
                              that of the underlying commodities because the indexes consist of futures con-
                              tracts on the commodities rather than the actual commodities.

                          32. B is correct. It is not a real estate index category.
Solutions                                                                                  121


33. B is correct. Hedge funds are not required to report their performance to any
    party other than their investors. Therefore, each hedge fund decides to which da-
    tabase(s) it will report its performance. Thus, for a hedge fund index, constituents
    determine the index rather than index providers determining the constituents.

34. A is correct. Voluntary performance reporting may lead to survivorship bias, and
    poorer performing hedge funds will be less likely to report their performance.

INTRODUCTION
Market efficiency concerns the extent to which market prices incorporate available
                                                                                          1
information. If market prices do not fully incorporate information, then opportunities
may exist to make a profit from the gathering and processing of information. The
subject of market efficiency is, therefore, of great interest to investment managers,
as illustrated in Example 1.

                          EXAMPLE 1

                             Market Efficiency and Active Manager Selection

                             1. The chief investment officer (CIO) of a major university endowment fund
                                has listed eight steps in the active manager selection process that can be
                                applied both to traditional investments (e.g., common equity and fixed-in-
                                come securities) and to alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge
                                funds, and real assets). The first step specified is the evaluation of market
                                opportunity:

                                  What is the opportunity and why is it there? To answer this question, we
                                  start by studying capital markets and the types of managers operating
                                  within those markets. We identify market inefficiencies and try to under-
                                  stand their causes, such as regulatory structures or behavioral biases. We
                                  can rule out many broad groups of managers and strategies by simply
                                  determining that the degree of market inefficiency necessary to support a
                                  strategy is implausible. Importantly, we consider the past history of active
                                  returns meaningless unless we understand why markets will allow those
                                  active returns to continue into the future.1
                                The CIO’s description underscores the importance of not assuming that past
                                active returns that might be found in a historical dataset will repeat them-
                                selves in the future. Active returns refer to returns earned by strategies that
                                do not assume that all information is fully reflected in market prices.

                               Governments and market regulators also care about the extent to which market
                          prices incorporate information. Efficient markets imply informative prices—prices that
                          accurately reflect available information about fundamental values. In market-based
                          economies, market prices help determine which companies (and which projects) obtain
                          capital. If these prices do not efficiently incorporate information about a company’s
                          prospects, then it is possible that funds will be misdirected. By contrast, prices that
                          are informative help direct scarce resources and funds available for investment to
                          their highest-valued uses.2 Informative prices thus promote economic growth. The
                          efficiency of a country’s capital markets (in which businesses raise financing) is an
                          important characteristic of a well-functioning financial system.
                               The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides specifics
                          on how the efficiency of an asset market is described and discusses the factors affecting
                          (i.e., contributing to and impeding) market efficiency. Section 3 presents an influential
                          three-way classification of the efficiency of security markets and discusses its implica-
                          tions for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management. Section
                          4 presents several market anomalies (apparent market inefficiencies that have received
                          enough attention to be individually identified and named) and describes how these
                          anomalies relate to investment strategies. Section 5 introduces behavioral finance and

The Description of Efficient Markets
An informationally efficient market (an efficient market) is a market in which asset
prices reflect new information quickly and rationally. An efficient market is thus a
market in which asset prices reflect all past and present information.3
    In this section we expand on this definition by clarifying the time frame required
for an asset’s price to incorporate information as well as describing the elements of
information releases assumed under market efficiency. We discuss the difference
between market value and intrinsic value and illustrate how inefficiencies or discrep-
ancies between these values can provide profitable opportunities for active investment.
As financial markets are generally not considered being either completely efficient or
inefficient, but rather falling within a range between the two extremes, we describe a
number of factors that contribute to and impede the degree of efficiency of a financial
market. Finally, we conclude our overview of market efficiency by illustrating how the
costs incurred by traders in identifying and exploiting possible market inefficiencies
affect how we interpret market efficiency.
    Investment managers and analysts, as noted, are interested in market efficiency
because the extent to which a market is efficient affects how many profitable trading
opportunities (market inefficiencies) exist. Consistent, superior, risk-adjusted returns
(net of all expenses) are not achievable in an efficient market.4 In an efficient market,
a passive investment strategy (i.e., buying and holding a broad market portfolio) that
does not seek superior risk-adjusted returns can be preferred to an active investment
strategy because of lower costs (for example, transaction and information-seeking
costs). By contrast, in a very inefficient market, opportunities may exist for an active
investment strategy to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns (net of all expenses in
executing the strategy) as compared with a passive investment strategy. In inefficient
markets, an active investment strategy may outperform a passive investment strategy
on a risk-adjusted basis. Understanding the characteristics of an efficient market and
being able to evaluate the efficiency of a particular market are important topics for
investment analysts and portfolio managers.
    An efficient market is a market in which asset prices reflect information quickly. But
what is the time frame of “quickly”? Trades are the mechanism by which information
can be incorporated into asset transaction prices. The time needed to execute trades
to exploit an inefficiency may provide a baseline for judging speed of adjustment.5


3 This definition is convenient for making several instructional points. The definition that most simply
explains the sense of the word efficient in this context can be found in Fama (1976): “An efficient capital
market is a market that is efficient in processing information” (p. 134).
4 The technical term for superior in this context is positive abnormal in the sense of higher than expected
given the asset’s risk (as measured, according to capital market theory, by the asset’s contribution to the
risk of a well-diversified portfolio).
5 Although the original theory of market efficiency does not quantify this speed, the basic idea is that
it is sufficiently swift to make it impossible to consistently earn abnormal profits. Chordia, Roll, and
Subrahmanyam (2005) suggest that the adjustment to information on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
is between 5 and 60 minutes.

                          The time frame for an asset’s price to incorporate information must be at least as long
                          as the shortest time a trader needs to execute a transaction in the asset. In certain
                          markets, such as foreign exchange and developed equity markets, market efficiency
                          relative to certain types of information has been studied using time frames as short as
                          one minute or less. If the time frame of price adjustment allows many traders to earn
                          profits with little risk, then the market is relatively inefficient. These considerations
                          lead to the observation that market efficiency can be viewed as falling on a continuum.
                              Finally, an important point is that in an efficient market, prices should be expected
                          to react only to the elements of information releases that are not anticipated fully
                          by investors—that is, to the “unexpected” or “surprise” element of such releases.
                          Investors process the unexpected information and revise expectations (for example,
                          about an asset’s future cash flows, risk, or required rate of return) accordingly. The
                          revised expectations enter or get incorporated in the asset price through trades in
                          the asset. Market participants who process the news and believe that at the current
                          market price an asset does not offer sufficient compensation for its perceived risk will
                          tend to sell it or even sell it short. Market participants with opposite views should be
                          buyers. In this way the market establishes the price that balances the various opinions
                          after expectations are revised.

                          EXAMPLE 2

                             Price Reaction to the Default on a Bond Issue
                             Suppose that a speculative-grade bond issuer announces, just before bond markets
                             open, that it will default on an upcoming interest payment. In the announce-
                             ment, the issuer confirms various reports made in the financial media in the
                             period leading up to the announcement. Prior to the issuer’s announcement,
                             the financial news media reported the following: 1) suppliers of the company
                             were making deliveries only for cash payment, reducing the company’s liquidity;
                             2) the issuer’s financial condition had probably deteriorated to the point that it
                             lacked the cash to meet an upcoming interest payment; and 3) although public
                             capital markets were closed to the company, it was negotiating with a bank for
                             a private loan that would permit it to meet its interest payment and continue
                             operations for at least nine months. If the issuer defaults on the bond, the con-
                             sensus opinion of analysts is that bondholders will recover approximately $0.36
                             to $0.38 per dollar face value.

                             1. If the market for the bond is efficient, the bond’s market price is most likely
                                to fully reflect the bond’s value after default:
                                A. in the period leading up to the announcement.
                                B. in the first trade prices after the market opens on the announcement
                                   day.
                                C. when the issuer actually misses the payment on the interest payment
                                   date.
                             Solution to 1:
                                B is correct. The announcement removed any uncertainty about default. In
                                the period leading up to the announcement, the bond’s market price incor-
                                porated a probability of default, but the price would not have fully reflected
                                the bond’s value after default. The possibility that a bank loan might permit
                                the company to avoid default was not eliminated until the announcement.
The Concept of Market Efficiency                                                                          127


   2. If the market for the bond is efficient, the piece of information that bond
      investors most likely focus on in the issuer’s announcement is that the issuer
      had:
        A. failed in its negotiations for a bank loan.
        B. lacked the cash to meet the upcoming interest payment.
        C. been required to make cash payments for supplier deliveries.
   Solution to 2:
       A is correct. The failure of the loan negotiations first becomes known in this
       announcement. The failure implies default.



Market Value versus Intrinsic Value
Market value is the price at which an asset can currently be bought or sold. Intrinsic
value (sometimes called fundamental value) is, broadly speaking, the value that
would be placed on it by investors if they had a complete understanding of the asset’s
investment characteristics.6 For a bond, for example, such information would include
its interest (coupon) rate, principal value, the timing of its interest and principal pay-
ments, the other terms of the bond contract (indenture), a precise understanding of
its default risk, the liquidity of its market, and other issue-specific items. In addition,
market variables such as the term structure of interest rates and the size of various
market premiums applying to the issue (for default risk, etc.) would enter into a dis-
counted cash flow estimate of the bond’s intrinsic value (discounted cash flow models
are often used for such estimates). The word estimate is used because in practice,
intrinsic value can be estimated but is not known for certain.
     If investors believe a market is highly efficient, they will usually accept market
prices as accurately reflecting intrinsic values. Discrepancies between market price
and intrinsic value are the basis for profitable active investment. Active investors seek
to own assets selling below perceived intrinsic value in the marketplace and to sell or
sell short assets selling above perceived intrinsic value.
     If investors believe an asset market is relatively inefficient, they may try to develop
an independent estimate of intrinsic value. The challenge for investors and analysts
is estimating an asset’s intrinsic value. Numerous theories and models, including
the dividend discount model, can be used to estimate an asset’s intrinsic value, but
they all require some form of judgment regarding the size, timing, and riskiness of
the future cash flows associated with the asset. The more complex an asset’s future
cash flows, the more difficult it is to estimate its intrinsic value. These complexities
and the estimates of an asset’s market value are reflected in the market through the
buying and selling of assets. The market value of an asset represents the intersection
of supply and demand—the point that is low enough to induce at least one investor
to buy while being high enough to induce at least one investor to sell. Because infor-
mation relevant to valuation flows continually to investors, estimates of intrinsic value
change, and hence, market values change.




6 Intrinsic value is often defined as the present value of all expected future cash flows of the asset.

                          EXAMPLE 3

                           Intrinsic Value

                           1. An analyst estimates that a security’s intrinsic value is lower than its market
                              value. The security appears to be:
                              A. undervalued.
                              B. fairly valued.
                              C. overvalued.
                           Solution to 1:
                              C is correct. The market is valuing the asset at more than its true worth.

                           2. A market in which assets’ market values are, on average, equal to or nearly
                              equal to intrinsic values is best described as a market that is attractive for:
                              A. active investment.
                              B. passive investment.
                              C. both active and passive investment.
                           Solution to 2:
                              B is correct because an active investment is not expected to earn superior
                              risk-adjusted returns if the market is efficient. The additional costs of active
                              investment are not justified in such a market.

                           3. Suppose that the future cash flows of an asset are accurately estimated. The
                              asset trades in a market that you believe is efficient based on most evidence,
                              but your estimate of the asset’s intrinsic value exceeds the asset’s market
                              value by a moderate amount. The most likely conclusion is that you have:
                              A. overestimated the asset’s risk.
                              B. underestimated the asset’s risk.
                              C. identified a market inefficiency.
                           Solution to 3:
                              B is correct. If risk is underestimated, the discount rate being applied to find
                              the present value of the expected cash flows (estimated intrinsic value) will
                              be too low and the intrinsic value estimate will be too high.

For markets to be efficient, prices should adjust quickly and rationally to the release
of new information. In other words, prices of assets in an efficient market should
“fully reflect” all information. Financial markets, however, are generally not classi-
fied at the two extremes as either completely inefficient or completely efficient but,
rather, as exhibiting various degrees of efficiency. In other words, market efficiency
should be viewed as falling on a continuum between extremes of completely efficient,
at one end, and completely inefficient, at the other. Asset prices in a highly efficient
market, by definition, reflect information more quickly and more accurately than
in a less-efficient market. These degrees of efficiency also vary through time, across
geographical markets, and by type of market. A number of factors contribute to and
impede the degree of efficiency in a financial market.


Market Participants
One of the most critical factors contributing to the degree of efficiency in a market
is the number of market participants. Consider the following example that illustrates
the relationship between the number of market participants and market efficiency.

EXAMPLE 4

   Illustration of Market Efficiency
   Assume that the shares of a small market capitalization (cap) company trade on
   a public stock exchange. Because of its size, it is not considered “blue-chip” and
   not many professional investors follow the activities of the company.7 A small-
   cap fund analyst reports that the most recent annual operating performance
   of the company has been surprisingly good, considering the recent slump in
   its industry. The company’s share price, however, has been slow to react to the
   positive financial results because the company is not being recommended by the
   majority of research analysts. This mispricing implies that the market for this
   company’s shares is less than fully efficient. The small-cap fund analyst recognizes
   the opportunity and immediately recommends the purchase of the company’s
   shares. The share price gradually increases as more investors purchase the shares
   once the news of the mispricing spreads through the market. As a result, it takes
   a few days for the share price to fully reflect the information.
        Six months later, the company reports another solid set of interim financial
   results. But because the previous mispricing and subsequent profit opportuni-
   ties have become known in the market, the number of analysts following the
   company’s shares has increased substantially. As a result, as soon as unexpected
   information about the positive interim results are released to the public, a large
   number of buy orders quickly drive up the stock price, thereby making the market
   for these shares more efficient than before.

    A large number of investors (individual and institutional) follow the major financial
markets closely on a daily basis, and if mispricings exist in these markets, as illus-
trated by the example, investors will act so that these mispricings disappear quickly.
Besides the number of investors, the number of financial analysts who follow or ana-
lyze a security or asset should be positively related to market efficiency. The number
of market participants and resulting trading activity can vary significantly through
time. A lack of trading activity can cause or accentuate other market imperfections
that impede market efficiency. In fact, in many of these markets, trading in many of


7 A “blue-chip” share is one from a well-recognized company that is considered to be high quality but
low risk. This term generally refers to a company that has a long history of earnings and paying dividends.

                          the listed stocks is restricted for foreigners. By nature, this limitation reduces the
                          number of market participants, restricts the potential for trading activity, and hence
                          reduces market efficiency.

                          EXAMPLE 5

                             Factors Affecting Market Efficiency

                             1. The expected effect on market efficiency of opening a securities market to
                                trading by foreigners would most likely be to:
                                  A. decrease market efficiency.
                                  B. leave market efficiency unchanged.
                                  C. increase market efficiency.
                             Solution:
                                 C is correct. The opening of markets as described should increase market
                                 efficiency by increasing the number of market participants.



                          Information Availability and Financial Disclosure
                          Information availability (e.g., an active financial news media) and financial disclo-
                          sure should promote market efficiency. Information regarding trading activity and
                          traded companies in such markets as the New York Stock Exchange, the London
                          Stock Exchange, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange is readily available. Many investors
                          and analysts participate in these markets, and analyst coverage of listed companies is
                          typically substantial. As a result, these markets are quite efficient. In contrast, trad-
                          ing activity and material information availability may be lacking in smaller securities
                          markets, such as those operating in some emerging markets.
                              Similarly, significant differences may exist in the efficiency of different types of
                          markets. For example, many securities trade primarily or exclusively in dealer or
                          over-the-counter (OTC) markets, including bonds, money market instruments, cur-
                          rencies, mortgage-backed securities, swaps, and forward contracts. The information
                          provided by the dealers that serve as market makers for these markets can vary signifi-
                          cantly in quality and quantity, both through time and across different product markets.
                              Treating all market participants fairly is critical for the integrity of the market and
                          explains why regulators place such an emphasis on “fair, orderly, and efficient mar-
                          kets.”8 A key element of this fairness is that all investors have access to the informa-
                          tion necessary to value securities that trade in the market. Rules and regulations that
                          promote fairness and efficiency in a market include those pertaining to the disclosure
                          of information and illegal insider trading.
                              For example, US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) Regulation FD
                          (Fair Disclosure) requires that if security issuers provide nonpublic information to
                          some market professionals or investors, they must also disclose this information to
                          the public.9 This requirement helps provide equal and fair opportunities, which is
                          important in encouraging participation in the market. A related issue deals with illegal
                          insider trading. The SEC’s rules, along with court cases, define illegal insider trading
                          as trading in securities by market participants who are considered insiders “while in

possession of material, nonpublic information about the security.”10 Although these
rules cannot guarantee that some participants will not have an advantage over others
and that insiders will not trade on the basis of inside information, the civil and crim-
inal penalties associated with breaking these rules are intended to discourage illegal
insider trading and promote fairness. In the European Union, insider trading laws are
generally enshrined in legislation and enforced by regulatory and judicial authorities.11


Limits to Trading
Arbitrage is a set of transactions that produces riskless profits. Arbitrageurs are trad-
ers who engage in such trades to benefit from pricing discrepancies (inefficiencies)
in markets. Such trading activity contributes to market efficiency. For example, if an
asset is traded in two markets but at different prices, the actions of buying the asset
in the market in which it is underpriced and selling the asset in the market in which
it is overpriced will eventually bring these two prices together. The presence of these
arbitrageurs helps pricing discrepancies disappear quickly. Obviously, market efficiency
is impeded by any limitation on arbitrage resulting from operating inefficiencies, such
as difficulties in executing trades in a timely manner, prohibitively high trading costs,
and a lack of transparency in market prices.
     Some market experts argue that restrictions on short selling limit arbitrage trading,
which impedes market efficiency. Short selling is the transaction whereby an investor
sells shares that he or she does not own by borrowing them from a broker and agreeing
to replace them at a future date. Short selling allows investors to sell securities they
believe to be overvalued, much in the same way they can buy those they believe to
be undervalued. In theory, such activities promote more efficient pricing. Regulators
and others, however, have argued that short selling may exaggerate downward market
movements, leading to crashes in affected securities. In contrast, some researchers
report evidence indicating that when investors are unable to borrow securities, that is to
short the security, or when costs to borrow shares are high, market prices may deviate
from intrinsic values.12 Furthermore, research suggests that short selling is helpful
in price discovery (that is, it facilitates supply and demand in determining prices).13


Transaction Costs and Information-Acquisition Costs
The costs incurred by traders in identifying and exploiting possible market inefficien-
cies affect the interpretation of market efficiency. The two types of costs to consider
are transaction costs and information-acquisition costs.
    ■    Transaction costs: Practically, transaction costs are incurred in trading to
         exploit any perceived market inefficiency. Thus, “efficient” should be viewed
         as efficient within the bounds of transaction costs. For example, consider a
         violation of the principle that two identical assets should sell for the same
         price in different markets. Such a violation can be considered to be a rather
         simple possible exception to market efficiency because prices appear to


10 Although not the focus of this particular reading, it is important to note that a party is considered an
insider not only when the individual is a corporate insider, such as an officer or director, but also when the
individual is aware that the information is nonpublic information [Securities and Exchange Commission,
Rules 10b5-1 (“Trading on the Basis of Material Nonpublic Information in Insider Trading Cases”) and
Rule 10b5-2 “Duties of Trust or Confidence in Misappropriation Insider Trading Cases”)].

                                  be inconsistently processing information. To exploit the violation, a trader
                                  could arbitrage by simultaneously shorting the asset in the higher-price
                                  market and buying the asset in the lower-price market. If the price discrep-
                                  ancy between the two markets is smaller than the transaction costs involved
                                  in the arbitrage for the lowest cost traders, the arbitrage will not occur,
                                  and both prices are in effect efficient within the bounds of arbitrage. These
                                  bounds of arbitrage are relatively narrow in highly liquid markets, such as
                                  the market for US Treasury bills, but could be wide in illiquid markets.
                              ■   Information-acquisition costs: Practically, expenses are always associated
                                  with gathering and analyzing information. New information is incorporated
                                  in transaction prices by traders placing trades based on their analysis of
                                  information. Active investors who place trades based on information they
                                  have gathered and analyzed play a key role in market prices adjusting to
                                  reflect new information. The classic view of market efficiency is that active
                                  investors incur information acquisition costs but that money is wasted
                                  because prices already reflect all relevant information. This view of effi-
                                  ciency is very strict in the sense of viewing a market as inefficient if active
                                  investing can recapture any part of the costs, such as research costs and
                                  active asset selection. Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) argue that prices must
                                  offer a return to information acquisition; in equilibrium, if markets are effi-
                                  cient, returns net of such expenses are just fair returns for the risk incurred.
                                  The modern perspective views a market as inefficient if, after deducting
                                  such costs, active investing can earn superior returns. Gross of expenses, a
                                  return should accrue to information acquisition in an efficient market.
                              In summary, a modern perspective calls for the investor to consider transaction
                          costs and information-acquisition costs when evaluating the efficiency of a market. A
                          price discrepancy must be sufficiently large to leave the investor with a profit (adjusted
                          for risk) after taking account of the transaction costs and information-acquisition costs
                          to reach the conclusion that the discrepancy may represent a market inefficiency.
                          Prices may somewhat less than fully reflect available information without there being
                          a true market opportunity for active investors.




              4           FORMS OF MARKET EFFICIENCY

                                            contrast weak-form, semi-strong-form, and strong-form market
                                            efficiency

                          Eugene Fama developed a framework for describing the degree to which markets
                          are efficient.14 In his efficient market hypothesis, markets are efficient when prices
                          reflect all relevant information at any point in time. This means that the market prices
                          observed for securities, for example, reflect the information available at the time.
                              In his framework, Fama defines three forms of efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and
                          strong. Each form is defined with respect to the available information that is reflected
                          in prices.

A finding that investors can consistently earn abnormal returns by trading on the
basis of information is evidence contrary to market efficiency. In general, abnormal
returns are returns in excess of those expected given a security’s risk and the market’s
return. In other words, abnormal return equals actual return less expected return.


Weak Form
In the weak-form efficient market hypothesis, security prices fully reflect all past
market data, which refers to all historical price and trading volume information. If
markets are weak-form efficient, past trading data are already reflected in current
prices and investors cannot predict future price changes by extrapolating prices or
patterns of prices from the past.15
    Tests of whether securities markets are weak-form efficient require looking at
patterns of prices. One approach is to see whether there is any serial correlation in
security returns, which would imply a predictable pattern.16 Although there is some
weak correlation in daily security returns, there is not enough correlation to make
this a profitable trading rule after considering transaction costs.
    An alternative approach to test weak-form efficiency is to examine specific trading
rules that attempt to exploit historical trading data. If any such trading rule consis-
tently generates abnormal risk-adjusted returns after trading costs, this evidence will
contradict weak-form efficiency. This approach is commonly associated with technical
analysis, which involves the analysis of historical trading information (primarily pric-
ing and volume data) in an attempt to identify recurring patterns in the trading data
that can be used to guide investment decisions. Many technical analysts, also referred
to as “technicians,” argue that many movements in stock prices are based, in large
part, on psychology. Many technicians attempt to predict how market participants
will behave, based on analyses of past behavior, and then trade on those predictions.
Technicians often argue that simple statistical tests of trading rules are not conclusive
because they are not applied to the more sophisticated trading strategies that can be
used and that the research excludes the technician’s subjective judgment. Thus, it is
difficult to definitively refute this assertion because there are an unlimited number
of possible technical trading rules.
    Can technical analysts profit from trading on past trends? Overall, the evidence
indicates that investors cannot consistently earn abnormal profits using past prices or
other technical analysis strategies in developed markets.17 Some evidence suggests,
however, that there are opportunities to profit on technical analysis in countries with
developing markets, including Hungary, Bangladesh, and Turkey, among others.18


15 Market efficiency should not be confused with the random walk hypothesis, in which price changes
over time are independent of one another. A random walk model is one of many alternative expected return
generating models. Market efficiency does not require that returns follow a random walk.
16 Serial correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which the returns in one period are related
to the returns in another period.

                          Semi-Strong Form
                          In a semi-strong-form efficient market, prices reflect all publicly known and available
                          information. Publicly available information includes financial statement data (such as
                          earnings, dividends, corporate investments, changes in management, etc.) and financial
                          market data (such as closing prices, shares traded, etc.). Therefore, the semi-strong
                          form of market efficiency encompasses the weak form. In other words, if a market is
                          semi-strong efficient, then it must also be weak-form efficient. A market that quickly
                          incorporates all publicly available information into its prices is semi-strong efficient.
                               In a semi-strong market, efforts to analyze publicly available information are futile.
                          That is, analyzing earnings announcements of companies to identify underpriced or
                          overpriced securities is pointless because the prices of these securities already reflect
                          all publicly available information. If markets are semi-strong efficient, no single investor
                          has access to information that is not already available to other market participants,
                          and as a consequence, no single investor can gain an advantage in predicting future
                          security prices. In a semi-strong efficient market, prices adjust quickly and accurately
                          to new information. Suppose a company announces earnings that are higher than
                          expected. In a semi-strong efficient market, investors would not be able to act on this
                          announcement and earn abnormal returns.
                               A common empirical test of investors’ reaction to information releases is the event
                          study. Suppose a researcher wants to test whether investors react to the announce-
                          ment that the company is paying a special dividend. The researcher identifies a sample
                          period and then those companies that paid a special dividend in the period and the
                          date of the announcement. Then, for each company’s stock, the researcher calculates
                          the expected return on the share for the event date. This expected return may be based
                          on many different models, including the capital asset pricing model, a simple market
                          model, or a market index return. The researcher calculates the excess return as the
                          difference between the actual return and the expected return. Once the researcher
                          has calculated the event’s excess return for each share, statistical tests are conducted
                          to see whether the abnormal returns are statistically different from zero. The process
                          of an event study is outlined in Exhibit 1.
Forms of Market Efficiency                                                                 135

         Calculate the excess return for each company in the sample as the actual

           Perform statistical analyses on the excess returns in the sample to see
                        whether these returns are different from zero




How do event studies relate to efficient markets? In a semi-strong efficient market,
share prices react quickly and accurately to public information. Therefore, if the
information is good news, such as better-than-expected earnings, one would expect
the company’s shares to increase immediately at the time of the announcement; if it
is bad news, one would expect a swift, negative reaction. If actual returns exceed what
is expected in absence of the announcement and these returns are confined to the
announcement period, then they are consistent with the idea that market prices react
quickly to new information. In other words, the finding of excess returns at the time
of the announcement does not necessarily indicate market inefficiency. In contrast,
the finding of consistent excess returns following the announcement would suggest
a trading opportunity. Trading on the basis of the announcement—that is, once the
announcement is made—would not, on average, yield abnormal returns.

                            1. Is the fact that the price of Tesla moves up immediately on the day after
                               the Q2 earnings (the first day of trading with this information) indicative of
                               efficiency regarding information?
                               Most likely.

                            2. Does the fact that the price of Tesla moves up but does not reach $420 on
                               the day the going-private Twitter announcement is made mean that inves-

                               Not necessarily. There was confusion and uncertainty about the going-pri-
                               vate transaction at the time, so the price did not close in on the proposed
                               $420 per share for going private.

                            3. Does the fact that the market price of the stock declined well before the
                               issue of going-private was laid to rest by Musk mean that the market is
                               inefficient?
                               Not necessarily. There were numerous analyses, discussions, and other news
                               regarding the likelihood of the transaction, all of which was incorporated in
                               the price of the stock before the going-private transaction was dismissed by
                               Musk.

                          economy-wide events, such as regulation changes and tax rate changes. The results

of most research are consistent with the view that developed securities markets might
be semi-strong efficient. But some evidence suggests that the markets in developing
countries may not be semi-strong efficient.19


Strong Form
In a strong-form efficient market, security prices fully reflect both public and
private information. A market that is strong-form efficient is, by definition, also
semi-strong- and weak-form efficient. In the case of a strong-form efficient market,
insiders would not be able to earn abnormal returns from trading on the basis of
private information. A strong-form efficient market also means that prices reflect all
private information, which means that prices reflect everything that the management
of a company knows about the financial condition of the company that has not been
publicly released. However, this is not likely because of the strong prohibitions against
insider trading that are found in most countries. If a market is strong-form efficient,
those with insider information cannot earn abnormal returns.
     Researchers test whether a market is strong-form efficient by testing whether
investors can earn abnormal profits by trading on nonpublic information. The results
of these tests are consistent with the view that securities markets are not strong-form
efficient; many studies have found that abnormal profits can be earned when nonpublic
information is used.20




IMPLICATIONS OF THE EFFICIENT MARKET

                explain the implications of each form of market efficiency for
                fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and the choice between
                active and passive portfolio management

The implications of efficient markets to investment managers and analysts are import-
ant because they affect the value of securities and how these securities are managed.
Several implications can be drawn from the evidence on efficient markets for devel-
oped markets:
    ■   Securities markets are weak-form efficient, and therefore, investors cannot
        earn abnormal returns by trading on the basis of past trends in price.
    ■   Securities markets are semi-strong efficient, and therefore, analysts who
        collect and analyze information must consider whether that information is
        already reflected in security prices and how any new information affects a
        security’s value.
    ■   Securities markets are not strong-form efficient because securities laws are
        intended to prevent exploitation of private information.

                          Fundamental Analysis
                          Fundamental analysis is the examination of publicly available information and the
                          formulation of forecasts to estimate the intrinsic value of assets. Fundamental analysis
                          involves the estimation of an asset’s value using company data, such as earnings and
                          sales forecasts, and risk estimates as well as industry and economic data, such as eco-
                          nomic growth, inflation, and interest rates. Buy and sell decisions depend on whether
                          the current market price is less than or greater than the estimated intrinsic value.
                               The semi-strong form of market efficiency says that all available public information
                          is reflected in current prices. So, what good is fundamental analysis? Fundamental
                          analysis is necessary in a well-functioning market because this analysis helps the
                          market participants understand the value implications of information. In other
                          words, fundamental analysis facilitates a semi-strong efficient market by disseminat-
                          ing value-relevant information. And, although fundamental analysis requires costly
                          information, this analysis can be profitable in terms of generating abnormal returns
                          if the analyst creates a comparative advantage with respect to this information.21


                          Technical Analysis
                          Investors using technical analysis attempt to profit by looking at patterns of prices
                          and trading volume. Although some price patterns persist, exploiting these patterns
                          may be too costly and, hence, would not produce abnormal returns.
                              Consider a situation in which a pattern of prices exists. With so many investors
                          examining prices, this pattern will be detected. If profitable, exploiting this pattern
                          will eventually affect prices such that this pattern will no longer exist; it will be arbi-
                          traged away. In other words, by detecting and exploiting patterns in prices, technical
                          analysts assist markets in maintaining weak-form efficiency. Does this mean that
                          technical analysts cannot earn abnormal profits? Not necessarily, because there may
                          be a possibility of earning abnormal profits from a pricing inefficiency. But would it
                          be possible to earn abnormal returns on a consistent basis from exploiting such a
                          pattern? No, because the actions of market participants will arbitrage this opportunity
                          quickly, and the inefficiency will no longer exist.


                          Portfolio Management
                          If securities markets are weak-form and semi-strong-form efficient, the implication is
                          that active trading, whether attempting to exploit price patterns or public information,
                          is not likely to generate abnormal returns. In other words, portfolio managers cannot
                          beat the market on a consistent basis, so therefore, passive portfolio management
                          should outperform active portfolio management. Researchers have observed that
                          mutual funds do not, on average, outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis.22
                          Mutual funds perform, on average, similar to the market before considering fees and
                          expenses and perform worse than the market, on average, once fees and expenses are
                          considered. Even if a mutual fund is not actively managed, there are costs to managing
                          these funds, which reduces net returns.
                               So, what good are portfolio managers? The role of a portfolio manager is not nec-
                          essarily to beat the market but, rather, to establish and manage a portfolio consistent
                          with the portfolio’s objectives, with appropriate diversification and asset allocation,
                          while taking into consideration the risk preferences and tax situation of the investor.

                 describe market anomalies

Although considerable evidence shows that markets are efficient, researchers have
identified a number of apparent market inefficiencies or anomalies. These market
anomalies, if persistent, are exceptions to the notion of market efficiency. Researchers
conclude that a market anomaly may be present if a change in the price of an asset
or security cannot directly be linked to current relevant information known in the
market or to the release of new information into the market.
     The validity of any evidence supporting the potential existence of a market inef-
ficiency or anomaly must be consistent over reasonably long periods. Otherwise, a
detected market anomaly may largely be an artifact of the sample period chosen. In the
widespread search for discovering profitable anomalies, many findings could simply
be the product of a process called data mining, also known as data snooping. In
generally accepted research practice, an initial hypothesis is developed which is based
on economic rationale. Tests are then conducted on objectively selected data to either
confirm or reject the original hypothesis. However, with data mining the process is
typically reversed: data are examined with the intent to develop a hypothesis, instead
of developing a hypothesis first. This is done by analyzing data in various manners,
and even utilizing different empirical approaches until you find support for a desired
result, in this case a profitable anomaly.
     Can researchers look back on data and find a trading strategy that would have
yielded abnormal returns? Absolutely. Enough data snooping often can detect a trading
strategy that would have worked in the past by chance alone. But in an efficient mar-
ket, such a strategy is unlikely to generate abnormal returns on a consistent basis in
the future. Also, although identified anomalies may appear to produce excess returns,
it is generally difficult to profitably exploit the anomalies after accounting for risk,
trading costs, and so on.
     Several well-known anomalies are listed in Exhibit 3. This list is by no means
exhaustive, but it provides information on the breadth of the anomalies. A few of
these anomalies are discussed in more detail in the following sections. The anomalies
are placed into categories based on the research method that identified the anom-
aly. Time-series anomalies were identified using time series of data. Cross-sectional
anomalies were identified based on analyzing a cross section of companies that differ
on some key characteristics. Other anomalies were identified by a variety of means,
including event studies.

                          Time-Series Anomalies
                          Two of the major categories of time-series anomalies that have been documented are
                          1) calendar anomalies and 2) momentum and overreaction anomalies.

                          Calendar Anomalies
                          In the 1980s, a number of researchers reported that stock market returns in January
                          were significantly higher compared to the rest of the months of the year, with most
                          of the abnormal returns reported during the first five trading days in January. Since
                          its first documentation in the 1980s, this pattern, known as the January effect, has
                          been observed in most equity markets around the world. This anomaly is also known
                          as the turn-of-the-year effect, or even often referred to as the “small firm in January
                          effect” because it is most frequently observed for the returns of small market capi-
                          talization stocks.23
                               The January effect contradicts the efficient market hypothesis because excess
                          returns in January are not attributed to any new and relevant information or news. A
                          number of reasons have been suggested for this anomaly, including tax-loss selling.
                          Researchers have speculated that, in order to reduce their tax liabilities, investors sell
                          their “loser” securities in December for the purpose of creating capital losses, which
                          can then be used to offset any capital gains. A related explanation is that these losers
                          tend to be small-cap stocks with high volatility.24 This increased supply of equities in
                          December depresses their prices, and then these shares are bought in early January at
                          relatively attractive prices. This demand then drives their prices up again. Overall, the
                          evidence indicates that tax-loss selling may account for a portion of January abnormal
                          returns, but it does not explain all of it.
                               Another possible explanation for the anomaly is so-called “window dressing”, a
                          practice in which portfolio managers sell their riskier securities prior to 31 December.
                          The explanation is as follows: many portfolio managers prepare the annual reports
                          of their portfolio holdings as of 31 December. Selling riskier securities is an attempt
                          to make their portfolios appear less risky. After 31 December, a portfolio manager
                          would then simply purchase riskier securities in an attempt to earn higher returns.
                          However, similar to the tax-loss selling hypothesis, the research evidence in support
                          of the window dressing hypothesis explains some, but not all, of the anomaly.
                               Recent evidence for both stock and bond returns suggests that the January effect is
                          not persistent and, therefore, is not a pricing anomaly. Once an appropriate adjustment
                          for risk is made, the January “effect” does not produce abnormal returns.25
                               Several other calendar effects, including the day-of-the-week and the weekend
                          effects,26 have been found. These anomalies are summarized in Exhibit 4.27 But like the
                          size effect, which will be described later, most of these anomalies have been eliminated


                          23 There is also evidence of a January effect in bond returns that is more prevalent in high-yield corporate
                          bonds, similar to the small-company effect for stocks.
                          24 See Roll (1983).
                          25 See, for example, Kim (2006).
                          26 For a discussion of several of these anomalous patterns, see Jacobs and Levy (1988).
                          27 The weekend effect consists of a pattern of returns around the weekend: abnormal positive returns
                          on Fridays followed by abnormally negative returns on Mondays. This is a day-of-the-week effect that
                          specifically links Friday and Monday returns. It is interesting to note that in 2009, the weekend effect in
                          the United States was inverted, with 80 percent of the gains from March 2009 onward coming from the

over time. One view is that the anomalies have been exploited such that the effect
has been arbitraged away. Another view, however, is that increasingly sophisticated
statistical methodologies fail to detect pricing inefficiencies.

Momentum and Overreaction Anomalies
Momentum anomalies relate to short-term share price patterns. One of the earliest
studies to identify this type of anomaly was conducted by Werner DeBondt and
Richard Thaler, who argued that investors overreact to the release of unexpected
public information.28 Therefore, stock prices will be inflated (depressed) for those
companies releasing good (bad) information. This anomaly has become known as
the overreaction effect. Using the overreaction effect, they proposed a strategy that
involved buying “loser” portfolios and selling “winner” portfolios. They defined stocks
as winners or losers based on their total returns over the previous three- to five-year
period. They found that in a subsequent period, the loser portfolios outperformed
the market, while the winner portfolios underperformed the market. Similar patterns
have been documented in many, but not all, global stock markets as well as in bond
markets. One criticism is that the observed anomaly may be the result of statistical
problems in the analysis.
    A contradiction to weak-form efficiency occurs when securities that have expe-
rienced high returns in the short term tend to continue to generate higher returns
in subsequent periods.29 Empirical support for the existence of momentum in stock
returns in most stock markets around the world is well documented. If investors
can trade on the basis of momentum and earn abnormal profits, then this anomaly
contradicts the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis because it represents a
pattern in prices that can be exploited by simply using historical price information.30
    Researchers have argued that the existence of momentum is rational and not
contrary to market efficiency because it is plausible that there are shocks to the
expected growth rates of cash flows to shareholders and that these shocks induce a

28 DeBondt and Thaler (1985).
29 Notice that this pattern lies in sharp contrast to DeBondt and Thaler’s reversal pattern that is displayed
over longer periods of time. In theory, the two patterns could be related. In other words, it is feasible that
prices are bid up extremely high, perhaps too high, in the short term for companies that are doing well.
In the longer term (three-to-five years), the prices of these short-term winners correct themselves and
they do poorly.

                          serial correlation that is rational and short lived.31 In other words, having stocks with
                          some degree of momentum in their security returns may not imply irrationality but,
                          rather, may reflect prices adjusting to a shock in growth rates.


                          Cross-Sectional Anomalies
                          Two of the most researched cross-sectional anomalies in financial markets are the
                          size effect and the value effect.

                          Size Effect
                          The size effect results from the observation that equities of small-cap companies
                          tend to outperform equities of large-cap companies on a risk-adjusted basis. Many
                          researchers documented a small-company effect soon after the initial research was
                          published in 1981. This effect, however, was not apparent in subsequent studies.32
                          Part of the reason that the size effect was not confirmed by subsequent studies may
                          be because of the fact that if it were truly an anomaly, investors acting on this effect
                          would reduce any potential returns. But some of the explanation may simply be that
                          the effect as originally observed was a chance outcome and, therefore, not actually
                          an inefficiency.

                          Value Effect
                          A number of global empirical studies have shown that value stocks, which are gen-
                          erally referred to as stocks that have below-average price-to-earnings (P/E) and
                          market-to-book (M/B) ratios, and above-average dividend yields, have consistently
                          outperformed growth stocks over long periods of time.33 If the effect persists, the value
                          stock anomaly contradicts semi-strong market efficiency because all the information
                          used to categorize stocks in this manner is publicly available.
                              Fama and French developed a three-factor model to predict stock returns.34 In
                          addition to the use of market returns as specified by the capital asset pricing model
                          (CAPM), the Fama and French model also includes the size of the company as mea-
                          sured by the market value of its equity and the company’s book value of equity divided
                          by its market value of equity, which is a value measure. The Fama and French model
                          captures risk dimensions related to stock returns that the CAPM model does not
                          consider. Fama and French find that when they apply the three-factor model instead
                          of the CAPM, the value stock anomaly disappears.

                          32 Although a large number of studies documents a small-company effect, these studies are concentrated
                          in a period similar to that of the original research and, therefore, use a similar data set. The key to whether
                          something is a true anomaly is persistence in out-of-sample tests. Fama and French (2008) document that
                          the size effect is apparent only in microcap stocks but not in small- and large-cap stocks and these microcap
                          stocks may have a significant influence in studies that document a size effect.

A number of additional anomalies has been documented in the financial markets,
including the existence of closed-end investment fund discounts, price reactions to
the release of earnings information, returns of initial public offerings, and the pre-
dictability of returns based on prior information.


Closed-End Investment Fund Discounts
A closed-end investment fund issues a fixed number of shares at inception and does
not sell any additional shares after the initial offering. Therefore, the fund capitalization
is fixed unless a secondary public offering is made. The shares of closed-end funds
trade on stock markets like any other shares in the equity market (i.e., their prices are
determined by supply and demand).
     Theoretically, these shares should trade at a price approximately equal to their
net asset value (NAV) per share, which is simply the total market value of the fund’s
security holdings less any liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. An
abundance of research, however, has documented that, on average, closed-end funds
trade at a discount from NAV. Most studies have documented average discounts in
the 4–10 percent range, although individual funds have traded at discounts exceeding
50 percent and others have traded at large premiums.35
     The closed-end fund discount presents a puzzle because conceptually, an investor
could purchase all the shares in the fund, liquidate the fund, and end up making a
profit. Some researchers have suggested that these discounts are attributed to man-
agement fees or expectations of the managers’ performance, but these explanations
are not supported by the evidence.36 An alternative explanation for the discount is
that tax liabilities are associated with unrealized capital gains and losses that exist
prior to when the investor bought the shares, and hence, the investor does not have
complete control over the timing of the realization of gains and losses.37 Although the
evidence supports this hypothesis to a certain extent, the tax effect is not large enough
to explain the entire discount. Finally, it has often been argued that the discounts exist
because of liquidity problems and errors in calculating NAV. The illiquidity explanation
is plausible if shares are recorded at the same price as more liquid, publicly traded
stocks; some evidence supports this assertion. But as with tax reasons, liquidity issues
explain only a portion of the discount effect.
     Can these discounts be exploited to earn abnormal returns if transaction costs
are taken into account? No. First, the transaction costs involved in exploiting the
discount—buying all the shares and liquidating the fund—would eliminate any profit.38
Second, these discounts tend to revert to zero over time. Hence, a strategy to trade
on the basis of these discounts would not likely be profitable.39


Earnings Surprise
Although most event studies have supported semi-strong market efficiency, some
researchers have provided evidence that questions semi-strong market efficiency.
One of these studies relates to the extensively examined adjustment of stock prices



35 See Dimson and Minio-Kozerski (1999) for a review of this literature.
36 See Lee, Sheifer, and Thaler (1990).
37 The return to owners of closed-end fund shares has three parts: 1) the price appreciation or depreciation
of the shares themselves, 2) the dividends earned and distributed to owners by the fund, and 3) the capital
gains and losses earned by the fund that are distributed by the fund. The explanation of the anomalous
pricing has to do with the timing of the distribution of capital gains.
38 See, for example, the study by Pontiff (1996), which shows how the cost of arbitraging these discounts
eliminates the profit.
39 See Pontiff (1995).

                          to earnings announcements.40 The unexpected part of the earnings announcement,
                          or earnings surprise, is the portion of earnings that is unanticipated by investors
                          and, according to the efficient market hypothesis, merits a price adjustment. Positive
                          (negative) surprises should cause appropriate and rapid price increases (decreases).
                          Several studies have been conducted using data from numerous markets around the
                          world. Most of the results indicate that earnings surprises are reflected quickly in stock
                          prices, but the adjustment process is not always efficient. In particular, although a
                          substantial adjustment occurs prior to and at the announcement date, an adjustment
                          also occurs after the announcement.41
                              As a result of these slow price adjustments, companies that display the largest
                          positive earnings surprises subsequently display superior stock return performance,
                          whereas poor subsequent performance is displayed by companies with low or negative
                          earnings surprises.42 This finding implies that investors could earn abnormal returns
                          using publicly available information by buying stocks of companies that had positive
                          earnings surprises and selling those with negative surprises.
                              Although there is support for abnormal returns associated with earnings surprises,
                          and some support for such returns beyond the announcement period, there is also
                          evidence indicating that these observed abnormal returns are an artifact of studies
                          that do not sufficiently control for transaction costs and risk.43


                          Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)
                          When a company offers shares of its stock to the public for the first time, it does so
                          through an initial public offering (or IPO). This offering involves working with an
                          investment bank that helps price and market the newly issued shares. After the offering
                          is complete, the new shares trade on a stock market for the first time. Given the risk
                          that investment bankers face in trying to sell a new issue for which the true price is
                          unknown, it is perhaps not surprising to find that, on average, the initial selling price
                          is set too low and that the price increases dramatically on the first trading day. The
                          percentage difference between the issue price and the closing price at the end of the
                          first day of trading is often referred to as the degree of underpricing.
                              The evidence suggests that, on average, investors who are able to buy the shares
                          of an IPO at their offering price may be able to earn abnormal profits. For example,
                          during the internet bubble of 1995–2000, many IPOs ended their first day of trading
                          up by more than 100 percent. Such performance, however, is not always the case.
                          Sometimes the issues are priced too high, which means that share prices drop on
                          their first day of trading. In addition, the evidence also suggests that investors buying
                          after the initial offering are not able to earn abnormal profits because prices adjust
                          quickly to the “true” values, which supports semi-strong market efficiency. In fact, the
                          subsequent long-term performance of IPOs is generally found to be below average.
                          Taken together, the IPO underpricing and the subsequent poor performance suggests
                          that the markets are overly optimistic initially (i.e., investors overreact).

                          41 Not surprisingly, it is often argued that this slow reaction contributes to a momentum pattern.
                          42 A similar pattern has been documented in the corporate bond market, where bond prices react too
                          slowly to new company earnings announcements as well as to changes in company debt ratings.
                          43 See Brown (1997) for a summary of evidence supporting the existence of this anomaly. See Zarowin
                          (1989) for evidence regarding the role of size in explaining abnormal returns to surprises; Alexander, Goff,
                          and Peterson (1989) for evidence regarding transaction costs and unexpected earnings strategies; and
                          Kim and Kim (2003) for evidence indicating that the anomalous returns can be explained by risk factors.

    Some researchers have examined closely why IPOs may appear to have anomalous
returns. Because of the small size of the IPO companies and the method of equally
weighting the samples, what appears to be an anomaly may simply be an artifact of
the methodology.44


Predictability of Returns Based on Prior Information
A number of researchers have documented that equity returns are related to prior
information on such factors as interest rates, inflation rates, stock volatility, and div-
idend yields.45 But finding that equity returns are affected by changes in economic
fundamentals is not evidence of market inefficiency and would not result in abnormal
trading returns.46
    Furthermore, the relationship between stock returns and the prior information is
not consistent over time. For example, in one study, the relationship between stock
prices and dividend yields changed from positive to negative in different periods.47
Hence, a trading strategy based on dividend yields would not yield consistent abnor-
mal returns.


Implications for Investment Strategies
Although it is interesting to consider the anomalies just described, attempting to benefit
from them in practice is not easy. In fact, most researchers conclude that observed
anomalies are not violations of market efficiency but, rather, are the result of statis-
tical methodologies used to detect the anomalies. As a result, if the methodologies
are corrected, most of these anomalies disappear.48 Another point to consider is that
in an efficient market, overreactions may occur, but then so do under-reactions.49
Therefore, on average, the markets are efficient. In other words, investors face chal-
lenges when they attempt to translate statistical anomalies into economic profits.
Consider the following quote regarding anomalies from the Economist (“Frontiers of
Finance Survey,” 9 October 1993):
        Many can be explained away. When transactions costs are taken into
        account, the fact that stock prices tend to over-react to news, falling back
        the day after good news and bouncing up the day after bad news, proves
        unexploitable: price reversals are always within the bid-ask spread. Others
        such as the small-firm effect, work for a few years and then fail for a few
        years. Others prove to be merely proxies for the reward for risk taking. Many
        have disappeared since (and because) attention has been drawn to them.
    It is difficult to envision entrusting your retirement savings to a manager whose
strategy is based on buying securities on Mondays, which tends to have negative returns
on average, and selling them on Fridays. For one thing, the negative Monday returns
are merely an average, so on any given week, they could be positive. In addition, such
a strategy would generate large trading costs. Even more importantly, investors would
likely be uncomfortable investing their funds in a strategy that has no compelling
underlying economic rationale.

              8           BEHAVIORAL FINANCE

                                          describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to
                                          understanding market anomalies

                          Behavioral finance examines investor behavior to understand how people make deci-
                          sions, individually and collectively. Behavioral finance does not assume that people
                          consider all available information in decision-making and act rationally by maximizing
                          utility within budget constraints and updating expectations consistent with Bayes’
                          formula. The resulting behaviors may affect what is observed in the financial markets.
                              In a broader sense, behavioral finance attempts to explain why individuals make
                          the decisions that they do, whether these decisions are rational or irrational. The focus
                          of much of the work in this area is on the behavioral biases that affect investment
                          decisions. The behavior of individuals, in particular their behavioral biases, has been
                          offered as a possible explanation for a number of pricing anomalies.
                              Most asset-pricing models assume that markets are rational and that the intrinsic
                          value of a security reflects this rationality. But market efficiency and asset-pricing
                          models do not require that each individual is rational—rather, only that the market
                          is rational. If individuals deviate from rationality, other individuals are assumed to
                          observe this deviation and respond accordingly. These responses move the market
                          toward efficiency. If this does not occur in practice, it may be possible to explain some
                          market anomalies referencing observed behaviors and behavioral biases.


                          Loss Aversion
                          In most financial models, the assumption is that investors are risk averse. Risk aver-
                          sion refers to the tendency of people to dislike risk and to require higher expected
                          returns to compensate for exposure to additional risk. Behavioral finance allows for
                          the possibility that the dissatisfaction resulting from a loss exceeds the satisfaction
                          resulting from a gain of the same magnitude. Loss aversion refers to the tendency of
                          people to dislike losses more than they like comparable gains. This results in a strong
                          preference for avoiding losses as opposed to achieving gains.50 Some argue that
                          behavioral theories of loss aversion can explain observed overreaction in markets. If
                          loss aversion is more important than risk aversion, researchers should observe that
                          investors overreact.51 Although loss aversion can explain the overreaction anomaly,
                          evidence also suggests that under reaction is just as prevalent as overreaction, which
                          counters these arguments.


                          Herding
                          Herding behavior has been advanced as a possible explanation of under reaction and
                          overreaction in financial markets. Herding occurs when investors trade on the same
                          side of the market in the same securities, or when investors ignore their own private
                          information and/or analysis and act as other investors do. Herding is clustered trad-
                          ing that may or may not be based on information.52 Herding may result in under- or
                          over-reaction to information depending upon the direction of the herd.

                          52 The term used when there is herding without information is “spurious herding.”

Overconfidence
A behavioral bias offered to explain pricing anomalies is overconfidence. If investors
are overconfident, they overestimate their ability to process and interpret information
about a security. Overconfident investors may not process information appropriately,
and if there is a sufficient number of these investors, stocks will be mispriced.53 But
most researchers argue that this mispricing is temporary, with prices correcting even-
tually. If it takes a sufficiently long time for prices to become correctly priced and the
mispricing is predictable, it may be possible for investors to earn abnormal profits.
    Evidence has suggested that overconfidence results in mispricing for US, UK,
German, French, and Japanese markets.54 This overconfidence, however, is predom-
inantly in higher-growth companies, whose prices react slowly to new information.55


Information Cascades
An application of behavioral theories to markets and pricing focuses on the role of
personal learning in markets. Personal learning is what investors learn by observing
outcomes of trades and what they learn from “conversations”—ideas shared among
investors about specific assets and the markets.56 Social interaction and the resultant
contagion is important in pricing and may explain such phenomena as price changes
without accompanying news and mistakes in valuation.
     Biases that investors possess can lead to herding behavior or information cas-
cades. Herding and information cascades are related but not identical concepts. An
information cascade is the transmission of information from those participants who
act first and whose decisions influence the decisions of others. Those who are acting
on the choices of others may be ignoring their own preferences in favor of imitating
the choices of others. In particular, information cascades may occur with respect to
the release of accounting information because accounting information may be diffi-
cult to interpret and may be noisy. For example, the release of earnings is difficult to
interpret because it is necessary to understand how the number was arrived at and
noisy because it is uncertain what the current earnings imply about future earnings.
     Information cascades may result in serial correlation of stock returns, which is
consistent with overreaction anomalies. Do information cascades result in correct
pricing? Some argue that if a cascade is leading toward an incorrect value, this cascade
is “fragile” and will be corrected because investors will ultimately give more weight
to public information or the trading of a recognized informed trader.57 Information
cascades, although documented in markets, do not necessarily mean that investors
can exploit knowledge of them as profitable trading opportunities.
     Are information cascades rational? If the informed traders act first and uninformed
traders imitate the informed traders, this behavior is consistent with rationality. The
imitation trading by the uninformed traders may help the market incorporate relevant
information and improve market efficiency.58 However, the imitation trading may lead




53 Another aspect to overconfidence is that investors who are overconfident in their ability to select
investments and manage a portfolio tend to use less diversification, investing in what is most familiar.
Therefore, investor behavior may affect investment results—returns and risk—without implications for
the efficiency of markets.

57 Avery and Zemsky (1999).
58 Another alternative is that the uninformed traders are the majority of the market participants and the
imitators are imitating not because they agree with the actions of the majority but because they are looking
to act on the actions of the uninformed traders.

                          to an overreaction to information. The empirical evidence indicates that information
                          cascades are greater for a stock when the information quality regarding the company
                          is poor.59 Information cascades may enhance the information available to investors.


                          Other Behavioral Biases
                          Other behavioral biases that have been put forth to explain observed investor behavior
                          include the following:
                              ■   representativeness—investors assess new information and probabili-
                                  ties of outcomes based on similarity to the current state or to a familiar
                                  classification;
                              ■   mental accounting—investors keep track of the gains and losses for dif-
                                  ferent investments in separate mental accounts and treat those accounts
                                  differently;
                              ■   conservatism—investors tend to be slow to react to new information and
                                  continue to maintain their prior views or forecasts; and
                              ■   narrow framing—investors focus on issues in isolation and respond to the
                                  issues based on how the issues are posed.60
                              The basic idea behind behavioral finance is that investors are humans and, there-
                          fore, imperfect. These observed less than rational behaviors may help explain observed
                          pricing anomalies. The beliefs investors have about a given asset’s value may not be
                          homogeneous. But an issue, which is controversial, is whether these insights can
                          help someone identify and exploit any mispricing. In other words, can investors use
                          knowledge of behavioral biases to predict how asset prices will be affected and act
                          based on the predictions to earn abnormal profits?


                          Behavioral Finance and Investors
                          Behavior biases can affect all market participants, from the novice investor to the
                          most experienced investment manager. An understanding of behavioral finance can
                          help market participants recognize their own and others’ behavioral biases. As a
                          result of this recognition, they may be able to respond and make improved decisions,
                          individually and collectively.


                          Behavioral Finance and Efficient Markets
                          The use of behavioral finance to explain observed pricing is an important part of the
                          understanding of how markets function and how prices are determined. Whether there
                          is a behavioral explanation for market anomalies remains a debate. Pricing anomalies
                          are continually being uncovered, and then statistical and behavioral explanations are
                          offered to explain these anomalies.
                               On the one hand, if investors must be rational for efficient markets to exist, then
                          all the imperfections of human investors suggest that markets cannot be efficient.
                          On the other hand, if all that is required for markets to be efficient is that investors
                          cannot consistently beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis, then the evidence does
                          support market efficiency.

  SUMMARY
This reading has provided an overview of the theory and evidence regarding market
efficiency and has discussed the different forms of market efficiency as well as the
implications for fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and portfolio management.
The general conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis is that it is not
possible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of
those expected for the level of risk of the investment.
    Additional key points include the following:
   ■   The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants
       and depth of analyst coverage, information availability, and limits to trading.
   ■   There are three forms of efficient markets, each based on what is considered
       to be the information used in determining asset prices. In the weak form,
       asset prices fully reflect all market data, which refers to all past price and
       trading volume information. In the semi-strong form, asset prices reflect
       all publicly known and available information. In the strong form, asset
       prices fully reflect all information, which includes both public and private
       information.
   ■   Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset, whereas market value
       refers to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. When markets
       are efficient, the two should be the same or very close. But when markets are
       not efficient, the two can diverge significantly.
   ■   Most empirical evidence supports the idea that securities markets in devel-
       oped countries are semi-strong-form efficient; however, empirical evidence
       does not support the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis.
   ■   A number of anomalies have been documented that contradict the notion of
       market efficiency, including the size anomaly, the January anomaly, and the
       winners–losers anomalies. In most cases, however, contradictory evidence
       both supports and refutes the anomaly.
   ■   Behavioral finance uses human psychology, such as behavioral biases, in
       an attempt to explain investment decisions. Whereas behavioral finance is
       helpful in understanding observed decisions, a market can still be consid-
       ered efficient even if market participants exhibit seemingly irrational behav-
       iors, such as herding.

                          6. With respect to efficient market theory, when a market allows short selling, the
                             efficiency of the market is most likely to:
                             A. increase.

                             B. decrease.

                             C. remain the same.

                          7. Which of the following regulations will most likely contribute to market efficien-
                             cy? Regulatory restrictions on:

   C. Penalizing investors who trade with nonpublic information.

9. An increase in the time between when an order to trade a security is placed and
   when the order is executed most likely indicates that market efficiency has:
   A. decreased.

   B. remained the same.

   C. increased.

10. With respect to the efficient market hypothesis, if security prices reflect only past
    prices and trading volume information, then the market is:
   A. weak-form efficient.

   B. strong-form efficient.

   C. semi-strong-form efficient.

11. Which one of the following statements best describes the semi-strong form of
    market efficiency?
   A. Empirical tests examine the historical patterns in security prices.

   B. Security prices reflect all publicly known and available information.

   C. Semi-strong-form efficient markets are not necessarily weak-form efficient.

12. If prices reflect all public and private information, the market is best described as:
   A. weak-form efficient.

   B. strong-form efficient.

   C. semi-strong-form efficient.

13. If markets are semi-strong efficient, standard fundamental analysis will yield
    abnormal trading profits that are:
   A. negative.

   B. equal to zero.

   C. positive.

14. If markets are semi-strong-form efficient, then passive portfolio management

                          15. If a market is semi-strong-form efficient, the risk-adjusted returns of a passively
                              managed portfolio relative to an actively managed portfolio are most likely:
                             A. lower.

                             B. higher.

                             C. the same.

                          16. Technical analysts assume that markets are:

                             C. semi-strong-form inefficient.

                          18. If a market is weak-form efficient but semi-strong-form inefficient, then which of
                              the following types of portfolio management is most likely to produce abnormal
                              returns?
                             A. Passive portfolio management.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. A security’s intrinsic value and market value should be equal when
                             markets are efficient.

                          2. B is correct. The intrinsic value of an undervalued asset is greater than the mar-
                             ket value of the asset, where the market value is the transaction price at which an
                             asset can be currently bought or sold.

                          3. B is correct. The market value is the transaction price at which an asset can be
                             currently bought or sold.

                          4. C is correct. Today’s price change is independent of the one from yesterday, and
                             in an efficient market, investors will react to new, independent information as it
                             is made public.

                          5. A is correct. Reducing the number of market participants can accentuate market
                             imperfections and impede market efficiency (e.g., restrictions on foreign investor
                             trading).

                          6. A is correct. According to theory, reducing the restrictions on trading will allow
                             for more arbitrage trading, thereby promoting more efficient pricing. Although
                             regulators argue that short selling exaggerates downward price movements, em-
                             pirical research indicates that short selling is helpful in price discovery.

                          7. C is correct. Regulation to restrict unfair use of nonpublic information encour-
                             ages greater participation in the market, which increases market efficiency.
                             Regulators (e.g., US SEC) discourage illegal insider trading by issuing penalties to
                             violators of their insider trading rules.

                          8. A is correct. Restricting short selling will reduce arbitrage trading, which pro-
                             motes market efficiency. Permitting foreign investor trading increases market
                             participation, which makes markets more efficient. Penalizing insider trading
                             encourages greater market participation, which increases market efficiency.

                          9. A is correct. Operating inefficiencies reduce market efficiency.

                          10. A is correct. The weak-form efficient market hypothesis is defined as a market
                              where security prices fully reflect all market data, which refers to all past price
                              and trading volume information.

                          11. B is correct. In semi-strong-form efficient markets, security prices reflect all
                              publicly available information.

                          12. B is correct. The strong-form efficient market hypothesis assumes all informa-
                              tion, public or private, has already been reflected in the prices.

                          13. B is correct. If all public information should already be reflected in the market
                              price, then the abnormal trading profit will be equal to zero when fundamental
                              analysis is used.

                          14. B is correct. Costs associated with active trading strategies would be difficult to
                              recover; thus, such active trading strategies would have difficulty outperforming
                              passive strategies on a consistent after-cost basis.

                          15. B is correct. In a semi-strong-form efficient market, passive portfolio strategies
Solutions                                                                                   157


   should outperform active portfolio strategies on a risk-adjusted basis.

16. B is correct. Technical analysts use past prices and volume to predict future
    prices, which is inconsistent with the weakest form of market efficiency (i.e.,
    weak-form market efficiency). Weak-form market efficiency states that investors
    cannot earn abnormal returns by trading on the basis of past trends in price and
    volume.

17. C is correct. Fundamental analysts use publicly available information to estimate
    a security’s intrinsic value to determine if the security is mispriced, which is
    inconsistent with the semi-strong form of market efficiency. Semi-strong-form
    market efficiency states that investors cannot earn abnormal returns by trading
    based on publicly available information.

18. C is correct. If markets are not semi-strong-form efficient, then fundamental ana-
    lysts are able to use publicly available information to estimate a security’s intrin-
    sic value and identify misvalued securities. Technical analysis is not able to earn
    abnormal returns if markets are weak-form efficient. Passive portfolio managers
    outperform fundamental analysis if markets are semi-strong-form efficient.

19. B is correct. The excess returns in January are not attributed to any new informa-
    tion or news; however, research has found that part of the seasonal pattern can
    be explained by tax-loss selling and portfolio window dressing.

20. A is correct. Finding significant abnormal returns does not necessarily indicate
    that markets are inefficient or that abnormal returns can be realized by applying
    the strategy to future time periods. Abnormal returns are considered market
    anomalies because they may be the result of the model used to estimate the
    expected returns or may be the result of underestimating transaction costs or
    other expenses associated with implementing the strategy, rather than because of
    market inefficiency.

21. A is correct. Higher than average dividend yield is a characteristic of a value
    stock, along with low price-to-earnings and low market-to-book ratios. Growth
    stocks are characterized by low dividend yields and high price-to-earnings and
    high market-to-book ratios.

22. B is correct. Trading based on historical momentum indicates that price patterns
    exist and can be exploited by using historical price information. A momentum
    trading strategy that produces abnormal returns contradicts the weak form of
    the efficient market hypothesis, which states that investors cannot earn abnormal
    returns on the basis of past trends in prices.

23. C is correct. If markets are efficient, the information from the annual report is
    reflected in the stock prices; therefore, the gradual changes must be from the
    release of additional information.

24. A is correct. The efficient market hypothesis and asset-pricing models only re-
    quire that the market is rational. Behavioral finance is used to explain some of the
    market anomalies as irrational decisions.

25. B is correct. Behavioral theories of loss aversion can explain observed overreac-
    tion in markets, such that investors dislike losses more than comparable gains
    (i.e., risk is not symmetrical).

26. C is correct. Behavioral theories of loss aversion allow for the possibility that the
    dislike for risk is not symmetrical, which allows for loss aversion to explain ob-
    served overreaction in markets such that investors dislike losses more than they

IMPORTANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Equity securities represent ownership claims on a company’s net assets. As an asset
                                                                                              1
class, equity plays a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio manage-
ment because it represents a significant portion of many individual and institutional
investment portfolios.
    The study of equity securities is important for many reasons. First, the decision
on how much of a client’s portfolio to allocate to equities affects the risk and return
characteristics of the entire portfolio. Second, different types of equity securities have
different ownership claims on a company’s net assets, which affect their risk and return
characteristics in different ways. Finally, variations in the features of equity securities
are reflected in their market prices, so it is important to understand the valuation
implications of these features.

                             This reading provides an overview of equity securities and their different features
                          and establishes the background required to analyze and value equity securities in a
                          global context. It addresses the following questions:
                             ■   What distinguishes common shares from preference shares, and what pur-
                                 poses do these securities serve in financing a company’s operations?
                             ■   What are convertible preference shares, and why are they often used to raise
                                 equity for unseasoned or highly risky companies?
                             ■   What are private equity securities, and how do they differ from public
                                 equity securities?
                             ■   What are depository receipts and their various types, and what is the ratio-
                                 nale for investing in them?
                             ■   What are the risk factors involved in investing in equity securities?
                             ■   How do equity securities create company value?
                             ■   What is the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its return on
                                 equity, and investors’ required rate of return?
                              The remainder of this reading is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an over-
                          view of global equity markets and their historical performance. Section 3 examines
                          the different types and characteristics of equity securities, and Section 4 outlines
                          the differences between public and private equity securities. Section 5 provides an
                          overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded in global markets.
                          Section 6 discusses the risk and return characteristics of equity securities. Section 7
                          examines the role of equity securities in creating company value and the relationship
                          between a company’s cost of equity, its return on equity, and investors’ required rate
                          of return. The final section summarizes the reading.


                          Equity Securities in Global Financial Markets
                          This section highlights the relative importance and performance of equity securities
                          as an asset class. We examine the total market capitalization and trading volume of
                          global equity markets and the prevalence of equity ownership across various geo-
                          graphic regions. We also examine historical returns on equities and compare them
                          to the returns on government bonds and bills.
                               Exhibit 1 summarizes the contributions of selected countries and geographic
                          regions to global gross domestic product (GDP) and global equity market capitaliza-
                          tion. Analysts may examine the relationship between equity market capitalization and
                          GDP as a rough indicator of whether the global equity market (or a specific country’s
                          or region’s equity market) is under, over, or fairly valued, particularly compared to
                          its long-run average.
                               Exhibit 1 illustrates the significant value that investors attach to publicly traded
                          equities relative to the sum of goods and services produced globally every year. It
                          shows the continued significance, and the potential over-representation, of US equity
                          markets relative to their contribution to global GDP. That is, while US equity markets
                          contribute around 51 percent to the total capitalization of global equity markets, their
                          contribution to the global GDP is only around 25 percent. Following the stock market
                          turmoil in 2008, however, the market capitalization to GDP ratio of the United States
                          fell to 59 percent, which is significantly lower than its long-run average of 79 percent.
                               As equity markets outside the United States develop and become increasingly
                          global, their total capitalization levels are expected to grow closer to their respective
                          world GDP contributions. Therefore, it is important to understand and analyze equity
                          securities from a global perspective.

Exhibit 2 lists the top 10 equity markets at the end of 2017 based on total market
capitalization (in billions of US dollars), trading volume, and the number of listed
companies.1 Note that the rankings differ based on the criteria used. For example,
the top three markets based on total market capitalization are the NYSE Euronext
(US), NASDAQ OMX, and the Japan Exchange Group; however, the top three markets
based on total US dollar trading volume are the Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext (US),

1 The market capitalization of an individual stock is computed as the share price multiplied by the number
of shares outstanding. The total market capitalization of an equity market is the sum of the market capital-
izations of each individual stock listed on that market. Similarly, the total trading volume of an equity market
is computed by value weighting the total trading volume of each individual stock listed on that market. Total
dollar trading volume is computed as the average share price multiplied by the number of shares traded.

                          index (“Wld”), the world ex-US (“WxU”), and Europe (“Eur”) during the 118 years
                          1900–2017.3 In real terms, government bonds and bills have essentially kept pace with
                          the inflation rate, earning annualized real returns of less than 2 percent in most coun-
                          tries.4 By comparison, real returns in equity markets have generally been around 3.5
                          percent per year in most markets—with a world average return of around 5.2 percent
                          and a world average return excluding the United States just under 5 percent. During
                          this period, South Africa and Australia were the best performing markets followed
                          by the United States, New Zealand, and Sweden.




                          3 The real return for a security is approximated by taking the nominal return and subtracting the observed
                          inflation rate in that country.
                          4 The exceptions are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Portugal, and Italy—where the average
                          real returns on government bonds and/or bills have been negative. In general, that performance reflects
                          the very high inflation rates in these countries during the World War years.

                          The volatility in asset market returns is further highlighted in Exhibit 5, which shows
                          the annualized risk premia for equity relative to bonds (EP Bonds), and equity relative
                          to treasury bills (EP Bills). Maturity premium for government bond returns relative
                          to treasury bill returns (Mat Prem) is also shown.
                              These observations and historical data are consistent with the concept that the
                          return on securities is directly related to risk level. That is, equity securities have higher
                          risk levels when compared with government bonds and bills, they earn higher rates
                          of return to compensate investors for these higher risk levels, and they also tend to
                          be more volatile over time.

                          Given the high risk levels associated with equity securities, it is reasonable to expect
                          that investors’ tolerance for risk will tend to differ across equity markets. This is
                          illustrated in Exhibit 6, which shows the results of a series of studies conducted by
                          the Australian Securities Exchange on international differences in equity ownership.
                          During the 2004–2014 period, equity ownership as a percentage of the population was
                          lowest in South Korea (averaging 9.0 percent), followed by Germany (14.5 percent)
                          and Sweden (17.7 percent). In contrast, Australia and New Zealand had the highest
                          equity ownership as a percentage of the population (averaging more than 20 percent).
                          In addition, there has been a relative decline in share ownership in several countries
                          over recent years, which is not surprising given the recent overall uncertainty in global
                          economies and the volatility in equity markets that this uncertainty has created.

An important implication from the above discussion is that equity securities represent
a key asset class for global investors because of their unique return and risk char-
acteristics. We next examine the various types of equity securities traded on global
markets and their salient characteristics.




CHARACTERISTICS OF EQUITY SECURITIES
                                                                                                               2

                 describe differences in voting rights and other ownership
                 characteristics among different equity classes

Companies finance their operations by issuing either debt or equity securities. A key
difference between these securities is that debt is a liability of the issuing company,
whereas equity is not. This means that when a company issues debt, it is contractually
obligated to repay the amount it borrows (i.e., the principal or face value of the debt)
at a specified future date. The cost of using these funds is called interest, which the
company is contractually obligated to pay until the debt matures or is retired.
    When the company issues equity securities, it is not contractually obligated to repay
the amount it receives from shareholders, nor is it contractually obligated to make
periodic payments to shareholders for the use of their funds. Instead, shareholders
have a claim on the company’s assets after all liabilities have been paid. Because of
this residual claim, equity shareholders are considered to be owners of the company.
Investors who purchase equity securities are seeking total return (i.e., capital or price
appreciation and dividend income), whereas investors who purchase debt securities
(and hold until maturity) are seeking interest income. As a result, equity investors
expect the company’s management to act in their best interest by making operating
decisions that will maximize the market price of their shares (i.e., shareholder wealth).


5 The percentages reported in the exhibit are based on samples of the adult population in each country
who own equity securities either directly or indirectly through investment or retirement funds. For example,
36 percent of the adult population of Australia in 2014 (approximately 6.5 million people) owned equity
securities either directly or indirectly. As noted in the study, it is not appropriate to make absolute com-
parisons across countries given the differences in methodology, sampling, timing, and definitions that have
been used in different countries. However, trends across different countries can be identified.

                             In addition to common shares (also known as ordinary shares or common stock),
                          companies may also issue preference shares (also known as preferred stock), the
                          other type of equity security. The following sections discuss the different types and
                          characteristics of common and preference securities.


                          Common Shares
                          Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and are the predomi-
                          nant type of equity security. As a result, investors share in the operating performance
                          of the company, participate in the governance process through voting rights, and have
                          a claim on the company’s net assets in the case of liquidation. Companies may choose
                          to pay out some, or all, of their net income in the form of cash dividends to common
                          shareholders, but they are not contractually obligated to do so.6
                              Voting rights provide shareholders with the opportunity to participate in major
                          corporate governance decisions, including the election of its board of directors, the
                          decision to merge with or take over another company, and the selection of outside
                          auditors. Shareholder voting generally takes place during a company’s annual meet-
                          ing. As a result of geographic limitations and the large number of shareholders, it is
                          often not feasible for shareholders to attend the annual meeting in person. For this
                          reason, shareholders may vote by proxy, which allows a designated party—such as
                          another shareholder, a shareholder representative, or management—to vote on the
                          shareholders’ behalf.
                              Regular shareholder voting, where each share represents one vote, is referred to as
                          statutory voting. Although it is the common method of voting, it is not always the
                          most appropriate one to use to elect a board of directors. To better serve shareholders
                          who own a small number of shares, cumulative voting is often used. Cumulative
                          voting allows shareholders to direct their total voting rights to specific candidates, as
                          opposed to having to allocate their voting rights evenly among all candidates. Total
                          voting rights are based on the number of shares owned multiplied by the number of
                          board directors being elected. For example, under cumulative voting, if four board
                          directors are to be elected, a shareholder who owns 100 shares is entitled to 400 votes
                          and can either cast all 400 votes in favor of a single candidate or spread them across
                          the candidates in any proportion. In contrast, under statutory voting, a shareholder
                          would be able to cast only a maximum of 100 votes for each candidate.
                              The key benefit to cumulative voting is that it allows shareholders with a small
                          number of shares to apply all of their votes to one candidate, thus providing the
                          opportunity for a higher level of representation on the board than would be allowed
                          under statutory voting.
                              Exhibit 7 describes the rights of Viacom Corporation’s shareholders. In this case, a
                          dual-share arrangement allows the founding chairman and his family to control more
                          than 70 percent of the voting rights through the ownership of Class A shares. This
                          arrangement gives them the ability to exert control over the board of director election
                          process, corporate decision making, and other important aspects of managing the
                          company. A cumulative voting arrangement for any minority shareholders of Class
                          A shares would improve their board representation.




                          6 It is also possible for companies to pay more than the current period’s net income as dividends. Such
                          payout policies are, however, generally not sustainable in the long run.
Characteristics of Equity Securities                                                                        167


 Exhibit 7: Share Class Arrangements at Viacom Corporation7

   Viacom has two classes of common stock: Class A, which is the voting stock,
   and Class B, which is the non-voting stock. There is no difference between the
   two classes except for voting rights; they generally trade within a close price
   range of each other. There are, however, far more shares of Class B outstanding,
   so most of the trading occurs in that class.
        ■   Voting Rights—Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one
            vote per share. Holders of Class B common stock do not have any vot-
            ing rights, except as required by Delaware law. Generally, all matters
            to be voted on by Viacom stockholders must be approved by a major-
            ity of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Class A common
            stock present in person or represented by proxy, except as required by
            Delaware law.
        ■   Dividends—Stockholders of Class A common stock and Class B
            common stock will share ratably in any cash dividend declared by the
            Board of Directors, subject to any preferential rights of any outstand-
            ing preferred stock. Viacom does not currently pay a cash dividend,
            and any decision to pay a cash dividend in the future will be at the
            discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on many factors.
        ■   Conversion—So long as there are 5,000 shares of Class A common
            stock outstanding, each share of Class A common stock will be con-
            vertible at the option of the holder of such share into one share of
            Class B common stock.
        ■   Liquidation Rights—In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or
            winding-up of Viacom, all stockholders of common stock, regardless
            of class, will be entitled to share ratably in any assets available for dis-
            tributions to stockholders of shares of Viacom common stock subject
            to the preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock.
        ■   Split, Subdivision, or Combination—In the event of a split, subdi-
            vision, or combination of the outstanding shares of Class A common
            stock or Class B common stock, the outstanding shares of the other
            class of common stock will be divided proportionally.
        ■   Preemptive Rights—Shares of Class A common stock and Class B
            common stock do not entitle a stockholder to any preemptive rights
            enabling a stockholder to subscribe for or receive shares of stock of
            any class or any other securities convertible into shares of stock of any
            class of Viacom.

    As seen in Exhibit 7, companies can issue different classes of common shares (Class
A and Class B shares), with each class offering different ownership rights.8 For exam-
ple, as shown in Exhibit 8, the Ford Motor Company has Class A shares (“Common
Stock”), which are owned by the investing public. It also has Class B shares, which
are owned only by the Ford family. The exhibit contains an excerpt from Ford’s 2017
Annual Report (p. 144). Class A shareholders have 60 percent voting rights, whereas
Class B shareholders have 40 percent. In the case of liquidation, however, Class B
shareholders will not only receive the first US$0.50 per share that is available for dis-

US Securities and Exchange Commission; see www​.viacom​.com.
8 In some countries, including the United States, companies can issue different classes of shares, with
Class A shares being the most common. The role and function of different classes of shares is described
in more detail in Exhibit 8.

                          tribution (as will Class A shareholders), but they will also receive the next US$1.00 per
                          share that is available for distribution before Class A shareholders receive anything
                          else. Thus, Class B shareholders have an opportunity to receive a larger proportion
                          of distributions upon liquidation than do Class A shareholders.9

                           Exhibit 8: Share Class Arrangements at Ford Motor Company10
                             NOTE 21. CAPITAL STOCK AND AMOUNTS PER SHARE
                             All general voting power is vested in the holders of Common Stock and Class B
                             Stock. Holders of our Common Stock have 60% of the general voting power and
                             holders of our Class B Stock are entitled to such number of votes per share as
                             will give them the remaining 40%. Shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock
                             share equally in dividends when and as paid, with stock dividends payable in
                             shares of stock of the class held.
                                 If liquidated, each share of Common Stock is entitled to the first $0.50 avail-
                             able for distribution to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, each share
                             of Class B Stock is entitled to the next $1.00 so available, each share of Common
                             Stock is entitled to the next $0.50 so available, and each share of Common and
                             Class B Stock is entitled to an equal amount thereafter.



                          Preference Shares
                          Preference shares (or preferred stock) rank above common shares with respect to
                          the payment of dividends and the distribution of the company’s net assets upon liq-
                          uidation.11 However, preference shareholders generally do not share in the operating
                          performance of the company and do not have any voting rights, unless explicitly
                          allowed for at issuance. Preference shares have characteristics of both debt securities
                          and common shares. Similar to the interest payments on debt securities, the divi-
                          dends on preference shares are fixed and are generally higher than the dividends on
                          common shares. However, unlike interest payments, preference dividends are not
                          contractual obligations of the company. Similar to common shares, preference shares
                          can be perpetual (i.e., no fixed maturity date), can pay dividends indefinitely, and can
                          be callable or putable.
                              Exhibit 9 provides an example of callable preference shares issued by the GDL
                          Fund to raise capital to redeem the remaining outstanding Series B Preferred shares.
                          In this case, the purchaser of the shares will receive an ongoing dividend from the
                          GDL Fund. If the GDL Fund chooses to buy back the shares, it must do so at the $50
                          a share liquidation preference price. The purchasers of the shares also have the right
                          to put back the shares to GDL at the $50 a share price.




                          9 For example, if US$2.00 per share is available for distribution, the Common Stock (Class A) shareholders
                          will receive US$0.50 per share, while the Class B shareholders will receive US$1.50 per share. However, if
                          there is US$3.50 per share available for distribution, the Common Stock shareholders will receive a total
                          of US$1.50 per share and the Class B shareholders will receive a total of US$2.00 per share.

                          11 Preference shares have a lower priority than debt in the case of liquidation. That is, debt holders have
                          a higher claim on a firm’s assets in the event of liquidation and will receive what is owed to them first,
                          followed by preference shareholders and then common shareholders.

 Exhibit 9: Callable Stock offering by the GDL Fund12

   RYE, NY—March 26, 2018—The GDL Fund (NYSE:GDL) (the “Fund”) is pleased
   to announce the completion of a rights offering (the “Offering”) in which the
   Fund issued 2,624,025 Series C Cumulative Puttable and Callable Preferred Shares
   (the “Series C Preferred”), totaling $131,201,250. Pursuant to the Offering, the
   Fund issued one non-transferable right (a “Right”) for each outstanding Series
   B Cumulative Puttable and Callable Preferred Share (the “Series B Preferred”)
   of the Fund to Series B Preferred shareholders of record as of February 14,
   2018. Holders of Rights were entitled to purchase the Series C Preferred with
   any combination of cash or surrender of the Series B Preferred at liquidation
   preference. Therefore, one Right plus $50.00, or one Right plus one share of
   Series B Preferred with a liquidation value of $50.00 per share, was required to
   purchase each share of the Series C Preferred. The Offering expired at 5:00 PM
   Eastern Time on March 20, 2018.

    Dividends on preference shares can be cumulative, non-cumulative, participat-
ing, non-participating, or some combination thereof (i.e., cumulative participat-
ing, cumulative non-participating, non-cumulative participating, non-cumulative
non-participating).
    Dividends on cumulative preference shares accrue so that if the company
decides not to pay a dividend in one or more periods, the unpaid dividends accrue
and must be paid in full before dividends on common shares can be paid. In con-
trast, non-cumulative preference shares have no such provision. This means that
any dividends that are not paid in the current or subsequent periods are forfeited
permanently and are not accrued over time to be paid at a later date. However, the
company is still not permitted to pay any dividends to common shareholders in the
current period unless preferred dividends have been paid first.
    Participating preference shares entitle the shareholders to receive the standard
preferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive an additional dividend if the com-
pany’s profits exceed a pre-specified level. In addition, participating preference shares
can also contain provisions that entitle shareholders to an additional distribution of
the company’s assets upon liquidation, above the par (or face) value of the preference
shares. Non-participating preference shares do not allow shareholders to share in
the profits of the company. Instead, shareholders are entitled to receive only a fixed
dividend payment and the par value of the shares in the event of liquidation. The use of
participating preference shares is much more common for smaller, riskier companies
where the possibility of future liquidation is more of a concern to investors.
    Preference shares can also be convertible. Convertible preference shares entitle
shareholders to convert their shares into a specified number of common shares. This
conversion ratio is determined at issuance. Convertible preference shares have the
following advantages:
    ■   They allow investors to earn a higher dividend than if they invested in the
        company’s common shares.
    ■   They allow investors the opportunity to share in the profits of the company.
    ■   They allow investors to benefit from a rise in the price of the common
        shares through the conversion option.
    ■   Their price is less volatile than the underlying common shares because the
        dividend payments are known and more stable.

                             Athens, Greece, June 21, 2018—TEN Ltd. (“TEN”) (NYSE: TNP), a leading diver-
                             sified crude, product and LNG tanker operator, today announced the pricing of
                             its public offering of its Series F Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable
                             Perpetual Preferred Shares, par value $1.00 per share, liquidation preference
                             $25.00 per share (“Series F Preferred Shares”). TEN will issue 5,400,000 Series
                             F Preferred Shares at a price to the public of $25.00 per share. Dividends will be
                             payable on the Series F Preferred Shares to July 30, 2028 at a fixed rate equal to
                             9.50% per annum and from July 30, 2028, if not redeemed, at a floating rate. In
                             connection with the offering, TEN has granted the underwriters a 30-day option
                             to purchase 810,000 additional Series F Preferred Shares, which, if exercised in
                             full, would result in total gross proceeds of $155,250,000. TEN intends to use
                             the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may
                             include making vessel acquisitions and/or strategic investments and preferred
                             share redemptions. Following the offering, TEN intends to file an application to
                             list the Series F Preferred Shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The offering
                             is expected to close on or about June 28, 2018.




              3           PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES

                                           compare and contrast public and private equity securities

                          Our discussion so far has focused on equity securities that are issued and traded in
                          public markets and on exchanges. Equity securities can also be issued and traded in
                          private equity markets. Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional
                          investors via non-public offerings, such as private placements. Because they are not
                          listed on public exchanges, there is no active secondary market for these securities.
                          As a result, private equity securities do not have “market determined” quoted prices,
                          are highly illiquid, and require negotiations between investors in order to be traded.
                          In addition, financial statements and other important information needed to deter-
                          mine the fair value of private equity securities may be difficult to obtain because the
                          issuing companies are typically not required by regulatory authorities to publish this
                          information.
                              There are three primary types of private equity investments: venture capital, lev-
                          eraged buyouts, and private investment in public equity (or PIPE). Venture capital
                          investments provide “seed” or start-up capital, early-stage financing, or mezzanine
                          financing to companies that are in the early stages of development and require addi-
                          tional capital for expansion. These funds are then used to finance the company’s product
                          development and growth. Venture capitalists range from family and friends to wealthy

Private Versus Public Equity Securities                                                                        171


individuals and private equity funds. Because the equity securities issued to venture
capitalists are not publicly traded, they generally require a commitment of funds for
a relatively long period of time; the opportunity to “exit” the investment is typically
within 3 to 10 years from the initial start-up. The exit return earned by these private
equity investors is based on the price that the securities can be sold for if and when
the start-up company first goes public, either via an initial public offering (IPO) on
the stock market or by being sold to other investors.
    A leveraged buyout (LBO) occurs when a group of investors (such as the com-
pany’s management or a private equity partnership) uses a large amount of debt to
purchase all of the outstanding common shares of a publicly traded company. In
cases where the group of investors acquiring the company is primarily comprised of
the company’s existing management, the transaction is referred to as a management
buyout (MBO). After the shares are purchased, they cease to trade on an exchange
and the investor group takes full control of the company. In other words, the company
is taken “private” or has been privatized. Companies that are candidates for these
types of transactions generally have large amounts of undervalued assets (which can
be sold to reduce debt) and generate high levels of cash flows (which are used to make
interest and principal payments on the debt). The ultimate objective of a buyout (LBO
or MBO) is to restructure the acquired company and later take it “public” again by
issuing new shares to the public in the primary market.
    The third type of private investment is a private investment in public equity,
or PIPE.14 This type of investment is generally sought by a public company that is in
need of additional capital quickly and is willing to sell a sizeable ownership position
to a private investor or investor group. For example, a company may require a large
investment of new equity funds in a short period of time because it has significant
expansion opportunities, is facing high levels of indebtedness, or is experiencing a
rapid deterioration in its operations. Depending on how urgent the need is and the
size of the capital requirement, the private investor may be able to purchase shares in
the company at a significant discount to the publicly-quoted market price. Exhibit 11
contains a recent PIPE transaction for the health care company TapImmune, which
also included the proposed merger with Maker Therapeutics.

 Exhibit 11: Example of a PIPE Transaction15

   JACKSONVILLE, Florida, June 8, 2018—TapImmune Inc. (NASDAQ: TPIV), a
   clinical-stage immuno-oncology company, today announced that it has entered
   into security purchase agreements with certain institutional and accredited inves-
   tors in connection with a private placement of its equity securities. The private
   placement will be led by New Enterprise Associates (NEA) with participation
   from Aisling Capital and Perceptive Advisors, among other new and existing
   investors. The private placement is expected to be completed concurrently
   with the closing of the proposed merger between TapImmune Inc. and Marker
   Therapeutics, Inc., which was previously announced on May 15, 2018.
       Upon closing the private placement, TapImmune will issue 17,500,000
   shares of its common stock at a price of $4.00 per share. The aggregate offering
   size, before deducting the placement agent fees and other offering expenses,
   is expected to be $70 million. Additionally, TapImmune will issue warrants to
   purchase 13,125,000 shares of TapImmune common stock at an exercise price
   of $5.00 per share that will be exercisable for a period of five years from the date
   of issuance. The closing of the transaction, which is subject to the closing of the

                             merger with Marker, the approval by TapImmune’s stockholders as required

                              While the global private equity market is relatively small in comparison to the
                          global public equity market, it has experienced considerable growth over the past three
                          decades. According to a study of the private equity market sponsored by the World
                          Economic Forum and spanning the period 1970–2007, approximately US$3.6 trillion
                          in debt and equity were acquired in leveraged buyouts. Of this amount, approximately
                          75 percent or US$2.7 trillion worth of transactions occurred during 2001–2007.16
                          This pace continued with a further US$2.9 trillion in transactions occurring during
                          2008-2017.17 While the US and the UK markets were the focus of most private equity
                          investments during the 1980s and 1990s, private equity investments outside of these
                          markets have grown substantially in recent years. In addition, the number of compa-
                          nies operating under private equity ownership has also grown. For example, during
                          the mid-1990s, fewer than 2,000 companies were under LBO ownership compared to
                          more than 20,000 companies that were under LBO ownership globally at the beginning
                          of 2017. The holding period for private equity investments has also increased during
                          this time period from 3 to 5 years (1980s and 1990s) to approximately 10 years.18
                              The move to longer holding periods has given private equity investors the opportu-
                          nity to more effectively and patiently address any underlying operational issues facing
                          the company and to better manage it for long-term value creation. Because of the
                          longer holding periods, more private equity firms are issuing convertible preference
                          shares because they provide investors with greater total return potential through
                          their dividend payments and the ability to convert their shares into common shares
                          during an IPO.
                              In operating a publicly traded company, management often feels pressured to
                          focus on short-term results19 (e.g., meeting quarterly sales and earnings targets from
                          analysts biased toward near-term price performance) instead of operating the com-
                          pany to obtain long-term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. By “going private,”
                          management can adopt a more long-term focus and can eliminate certain costs that
                          are necessary to operate a publicly traded company—such as the cost of meeting
                          regulatory and stock exchange filing requirements, the cost of maintaining investor
                          relations departments to communicate with shareholders and the media, and the cost
                          of holding quarterly analyst conference calls.
                              As described above, public equity markets are much larger than private equity
                          networks and allow companies more opportunities to raise capital that is subsequently
                          actively traded in secondary markets. By operating under public scrutiny, companies
                          are incentivized to be more open in terms of corporate governance and executive
                          compensation to ensure that they are acting for the benefit of shareholders. In fact,
                          some studies have shown that private equity firms score lower in terms of corporate
                          governance effectiveness, which may be attributed to the fact that shareholders,
                          analysts, and other stakeholders are able to influence management when corporate
                          governance and other policies are public.

NON-DOMESTIC EQUITY SECURITIES
                                                                                            4
                describe methods for investing in non-domestic equity securities

Technological innovations and the growth of electronic information exchanges
(electronic trading networks, the internet, etc.) have accelerated the integration and
growth of global financial markets. As detailed previously, global capital markets have
expanded at a much more rapid rate than global GDP in recent years; both primary
and secondary international markets have benefited from the enhanced ability to
rapidly and openly exchange information. Increased integration of equity markets
has made it easier and less expensive for companies to raise capital and to expand
their shareholder base beyond their local market. Integration has also made it easier
for investors to invest in companies that are located outside of their domestic mar-
kets. This has enabled investors to further diversify and improve the risk and return
characteristics of their portfolios by adding a class of assets with lower correlations
to local country assets.
    One barrier to investing globally is that many countries still impose “foreign
restrictions” on individuals and companies from other countries that want to invest
in their domestic companies. There are three primary reasons for these restrictions.
The first is to limit the amount of control that foreign investors can exert on domestic
companies. For example, some countries prevent foreign investors from acquiring a
majority interest in domestic companies. The second is to give domestic investors the
opportunity to own shares in the foreign companies that are conducting business in
their country. For example, the Swedish home furnishings retailer IKEA abandoned
efforts to invest in parts of the Asia/Pacific region because local governments did not
want IKEA to maintain complete ownership of its stores. The third reason is to reduce
the volatility of capital flows into and out of domestic equity markets. For example,
one of the main consequences of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997–98 was the large
outflow of capital from such emerging market countries as Thailand, Indonesia, and
South Korea. These outflows led to dramatic declines in the equity markets of these
countries and significant currency devaluations and resulted in many governments
placing restrictions on capital flows. Today, many of these same markets have built
up currency reserves to better withstand capital outflows inherent in economic con-
tractions and periods of financial market turmoil.
    Studies have shown that reducing restrictions on foreign ownership has led to
improved equity market performance over the long term.20 Although restrictions vary
widely, more countries are allowing increasing levels of foreign ownership. For exam-
ple, Australia has sought tax reforms as a means to encourage international demand
for its managed funds in order to increase its role as an international financial center.
    Over the past two decades, three trends have emerged: a) an increasing number
of companies have issued shares in markets outside of their home country; b) the
number of companies whose shares are traded in markets outside of their home has
increased; and c) an increasing number of companies are dual listed, which means that
their shares are simultaneously issued and traded in two or more markets. Companies
located in emerging markets have particularly benefited from these trends because
they no longer have to be concerned with capital constraints or lack of liquidity in
their domestic markets. These companies have found it easier to raise capital in the
markets of developed countries because these markets generally have higher levels of

                          Being listed on an international exchange has a number of benefits. It can increase
                          investor awareness about the company’s products and services, enhance the liquidity
                          of the company’s shares, and increase corporate transparency because of the addi-
                          tional market exposure and the need to meet a greater number of filing requirements.
                              Technological advancements have made it easier for investors to trade shares
                          in foreign markets. The German insurance company Allianz SE recently delisted its
                          shares from the NYSE and certain European markets because international investors
                          increasingly traded its shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Exhibit 12 illustrates
                          the extent to which the institutional shareholder base at BASF, a large German chem-
                          ical corporation, has become increasingly global in nature.

                             BASF is one of the largest publicly owned companies with over 500,000 share-
                             holders and a high free float. An analysis of the shareholder structure carried
                             out in March 2018 showed that, at 21% of share capital, the United States and
                             Canada made up the largest regional group of institutional investors. Institutional
                             investors from Germany made up 12%. Shareholders from United Kingdom and
                             Ireland held 12% of BASF shares, while a further 17% are held by institutional
                             investors from the rest of Europe. Around 28% of the company’s share capital
                             is held by private investors, most of whom are resident in Germany.

                          Direct Investing
                          Investors can use a variety of methods to invest in the equity of companies outside of
                          their local market. The most obvious is to buy and sell securities directly in foreign
                          markets. However, this means that all transactions—including the purchase and sale of
                          shares, dividend payments, and capital gains—are in the company’s, not the investor’s,
                          domestic currency. In addition, investors must be familiar with the trading, clearing,
                          and settlement regulations and procedures of that market. Investing directly often
                          results in less transparency and more volatility because audited financial information
                          may not be provided on a regular basis and the market may be less liquid. Alternatively,
                          investors can use such securities as depository receipts and global registered shares,

which represent the equity of international companies and are traded on local exchanges
and in the local currencies. With these securities, investors have to worry less about
currency conversions (price quotations and dividend payments are in the investor’s
local currency), unfamiliar market practices, and differences in accounting standards.

Depository Receipts
A depository receipt22 (DR) is a security that trades like an ordinary share on a
local exchange and represents an economic interest in a foreign company. It allows
the publicly listed shares of a foreign company to be traded on an exchange outside
its domestic market. A depository receipt is created when the equity shares of a for-
eign company are deposited in a bank (i.e., the depository) in the country on whose
exchange the shares will trade. The depository then issues receipts that represent the
shares that were deposited. The number of receipts issued and the price of each DR is
based on a ratio, which specifies the number of depository receipts to the underlying
shares. Consequently, a DR may represent one share of the underlying stock, many
shares of the underlying stock, or a fractional share of the underlying stock. The price
of each DR will be affected by factors that affect the price of the underlying shares,
such as company fundamentals, market conditions, analysts’ recommendations, and
exchange rate movements. In addition, any short-term valuation discrepancies between
shares traded on multiple exchanges represent a quick arbitrage profit opportunity for
astute traders to exploit. The responsibilities of the depository bank that issues the
receipts include acting as custodian and as a registrar. This entails handling dividend
payments, other taxable events, stock splits, and serving as the transfer agent for the
foreign company whose securities the DR represents. The Bank of New York Mellon
is the largest depository bank; however, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, and Citibank also
offer depository services.23
     A DR can be sponsored or unsponsored. A sponsored DR is when the foreign
company whose shares are held by the depository has a direct involvement in the
issuance of the receipts. Investors in sponsored DRs have the same rights as the
direct owners of the common shares (e.g., the right to vote and the right to receive
dividends). In contrast, with an unsponsored DR, the underlying foreign company has
no involvement with the issuance of the receipts. Instead, the depository purchases the
foreign company’s shares in its domestic market and then issues the receipts through
brokerage firms in the depository’s local market. In this case, the depository bank, not
the investors in the DR, retains the voting rights. Sponsored DRs are generally subject
to greater reporting requirements than unsponsored DRs. In the United States, for
example, sponsored DRs must be registered (meet the reporting requirements) with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Exhibit 13 contains an example
of a sponsored DR issued by Alibaba in September 2014.

                             September 19, 2014, represent the largest Depositary Receipt program in initial
                             public offering market history.
                                 Alibaba Group’s ADR program was established through a $25.03 billion
                             initial public offering of 368,122,000 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”),
                             representing ordinary shares of Alibaba Group, which was priced at $68 per ADS
                             on September 18, 2014. The IPO ranks as the largest in history. The ADRs are
                             listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the trading symbol
                             BABA. Each ADS represents one ordinary share of the Company. In its role as
                             depositary bank, Citibank will hold the underlying ordinary shares through its
                             local custodian and issue ADSs representing such shares. Alibaba Group’s ADSs
                             trade on the NYSE in ADR form.

                            There are two types of depository receipts: Global depository receipts (GDRs) and
                          American depository receipts (ADRs), which are described below.

                          Global Depository Receipts
                          A global depository receipt (GDR) is issued outside of the company’s home country
                          and outside of the United States. The depository bank that issues GDRs is generally
                          located (or has branches) in the countries on whose exchanges the shares are traded.
                          A key advantage of GDRs is that they are not subject to the foreign ownership and
                          capital flow restrictions that may be imposed by the issuing company’s home country
                          because they are sold outside of that country. The issuing company selects the exchange
                          where the GDR is to be traded based on such factors as investors’ familiarity with
                          the company or the existence of a large international investor base. The London and
                          Luxembourg exchanges were the first ones to trade GDRs. Some other stock exchanges
                          trading GDRs are the Dubai International Financial Exchange and the Singapore Stock
                          Exchange. Currently, the London and Luxembourg exchanges are where most GDRs
                          are traded because they can be issued in a more timely manner and at a lower cost.
                          Regardless of the exchange they are traded on, the majority of GDRs are denominated
                          in US dollars, although the number of GDRs denominated in pound sterling and euros
                          is increasing. Note that although GDRs cannot be listed on US exchanges, they can
                          be privately placed with institutional investors based in the United States.

                          American Depository Receipts
                          An American depository receipt (ADR) is a US dollar-denominated security that
                          trades like a common share on US exchanges. First created in 1927, ADRs are the oldest
                          type of depository receipts and are currently the most commonly traded depository
                          receipts. They enable foreign companies to raise capital from US investors. Note that
                          an ADR is one form of a GDR; however, not all GDRs are ADRs because GDRs cannot
                          be publicly traded in the United States. The term American depository share (ADS)
                          is often used in tandem with the term ADR. A depository share is a security that is
                          actually traded in the issuing company’s domestic market. That is, while American
                          depository receipts are the certificates that are traded on US markets, American
                          depository shares are the underlying shares on which these receipts are based.
                              There are four primary types of ADRs, with each type having different levels of
                          corporate governance and filing requirements. Level I Sponsored ADRs trade in the
                          over-the-counter (OTC) market and do not require full registration with the Securities
                          and Exchange Commission (SEC). Level II and Level III Sponsored ADRs can trade
                          on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and American Stock Exchange
                          (AMEX). Level II and III ADRs allow companies to raise capital and make acquisitions
                          using these securities. However, the issuing companies must fulfill all SEC requirements.
Non-Domestic Equity Securities                                                                                             177


    The fourth type of ADR, an SEC Rule 144A or a Regulation S depository receipt,
does not require SEC registration. Instead, foreign companies are able to raise capital
by privately placing these depository receipts with qualified institutional investors
or to offshore non-US investors. Exhibit 14 summarizes the main features of ADRs.

More than 2,000 DRs, from over 80 countries, currently trade on US exchanges. Based
on current statistics, the total market value of DRs issued and traded is estimated at
approximately US$2 trillion, or 15 percent of the total dollar value of equities traded
in US markets.25

Global Registered Share
A global registered share (GRS) is a common share that is traded on different stock
exchanges around the world in different currencies. Currency conversions are not
needed to purchase or sell them, because identical shares are quoted and traded in
different currencies. Thus, the same share purchased on the Swiss exchange in Swiss
francs can be sold on the Tokyo exchange for Japanese yen. As a result, GRSs offer
more flexibility than depository receipts because the shares represent an actual own-
ership interest in the company that can be traded anywhere and currency conversions
are not needed to purchase or sell them. GRSs were created and issued by Daimler
Chrysler in 1998 and by UBS AG in 2011.

Basket of Listed Depository Receipts
Another type of global security is a basket of listed depository receipts (BLDR),
which is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that represents a portfolio of depository
receipts. An ETF is a security that tracks an index but trades like an individual share
on an exchange. An equity-ETF is a security that contains a portfolio of equities that
tracks an index. It trades throughout the day and can be bought, sold, or sold short,
just like an individual share. Like ordinary shares, ETFs can also be purchased on
margin and used in hedging or arbitrage strategies. The BLDR is a specific class of

                          acteristics. The following sections discuss the different return and risk characteristics
                          of equity securities.


                          Return Characteristics of Equity Securities
                          There are two main sources of equity securities’ total return: price change (or capital
                          gain) and dividend income. The price change represents the difference between the
                          purchase price (Pt–1) and the sale price (Pt) of a share at the end of time t – 1 and t,
                          respectively. Cash or stock dividends (Dt) represent distributions that the company
                          makes to its shareholders during period t. Therefore, an equity security’s total return
                          is calculated as:
                             Total return, Rt = (Pt – Pt–1 + Dt)/Pt–1                                        (1)
                          For non-dividend-paying stocks, the total return consists of price appreciation only.
                          Companies that are in the early stages of their life cycle generally do not pay dividends
                          because earnings and cash flows are reinvested to finance the company’s growth. In
                          contrast, companies that are in the mature phase of their life cycle may not have as
                          many profitable growth opportunities; therefore, excess cash flows are often returned
                          to investors via the payment of regular dividends or through share repurchases.
                              For investors who purchase depository receipts or foreign shares directly, there is
                          a third source of return: foreign exchange gains (or losses). Foreign exchange gains
                          arise because of the change in the exchange rate between the investor’s currency and
                          the currency that the foreign shares are denominated in. For example, US investors
                          who purchase the ADRs of a Japanese company will earn an additional return if the
                          yen appreciates relative to the US dollar. Conversely, these investors will earn a lower
                          total return if the yen depreciates relative to the US dollar. For example, if the total
                          return for a Japanese company was 10 percent in Japan and the yen depreciated by 10
                          percent against the US dollar, the total return of the ADR would be (approximately)
                          0 percent. If the yen had instead appreciated by 10 percent against the US dollar, the
                          total return of the ADR would be (approximately) 20 percent.
                              Investors that only consider price appreciation overlook an important source of
                          return: the compounding that results from reinvested dividends. Reinvested dividends
                          are cash dividends that the investor receives and uses to purchase additional shares.
                          As Exhibit 15 shows, in the long run total returns on equity securities are dramat-
                          ically influenced by the compounding effect of reinvested dividends. Between 1900
                          and 2016, US$1 invested in US equities in 1900 would have grown in real terms to
                          US$1,402 with dividends reinvested, but to just US$11.9 when taking only the price
                          appreciation or capital gain into account. This corresponds to a real compounded return

of 6.4 percent per year with dividends reinvested, versus only 2.1 percent per year
without dividends reinvested. The comparable ending real wealth for bonds and bills
are US$9.8 and US$2.60, respectively. These ending real wealth figures correspond to
annualized real compounded returns of 2.0 percent on bonds and 0.8 percent on bills.

Risk of Equity Securities
The risk of any security is based on the uncertainty of its future cash flows. The greater
the uncertainty of its future cash flows, the greater the risk and the more variable or
volatile the security’s price. As discussed above, an equity security’s total return is
determined by its price change and dividends. Therefore, the risk of an equity secu-
rity can be defined as the uncertainty of its expected (or future) total return. Risk is
most often measured by calculating the standard deviation of the equity’s expected
total return.
     A variety of different methods can be used to estimate an equity’s expected total
return and risk. One method uses the equity’s average historical return and the standard
deviation of this return as proxies for its expected future return and risk. Another
method involves estimating a range of future returns over a specified period of time,
assigning probabilities to those returns, and then calculating an expected return and
a standard deviation of return based on this information.
     The type of equity security, as well as its characteristics, affects the uncertainty of
its future cash flows and therefore its risk. In general, preference shares are less risky
than common shares for three main reasons:
   1. Dividends on preference shares are known and fixed, and they account for
      a large portion of the preference shares’ total return. Therefore, there is less
      uncertainty about future cash flows.
   2. Preference shareholders receive dividends and other distributions before
      common shareholders.
180   Learning Module 4                                                                 Overview of Equity Securities


                             3. The amount preference shareholders will receive if the company is liqui-
                                dated is known and fixed as the par (or face) value of their shares. However,
                                there is no guarantee that investors will receive that amount if the company
                                experiences financial difficulty.
                               With common shares, however, a larger portion of shareholders’ total return (or
                          all of their total return for non-dividend shares) is based on future price appreciation
                          and future dividends are unknown. If the company is liquidated, common shareholders
                          will receive whatever amount (if any) is remaining after the company’s creditors and
                          preference shareholders have been paid. In summary, because the uncertainty sur-
                          rounding the total return of preference shares is less than common shares, preference
                          shares have lower risk and lower expected return than common shares.
                               It is important to note that some preference shares and common shares can be
                          riskier than others because of their associated characteristics. For example, from an
                          investor’s point of view, putable common or preference shares are less risky than
                          their callable or non-callable counterparts because they give the investor the option
                          to sell the shares to the issuer at a pre-determined price. This pre-determined price
                          establishes a minimum price that investors will receive and reduces the uncertainty
                          associated with the security’s future cash flow. As a result, putable shares generally
                          pay a lower dividend than non-putable shares.
                               Because the major source of total return for preference shares is dividend income,
                          the primary risk affecting all preference shares is the uncertainty of future dividend
                          payments. Regardless of the preference shares’ features (callable, putable, cumulative,
                          etc.), the greater the uncertainty surrounding the issuer’s ability to pay dividends, the
                          greater risk. Because the ability of a company to pay dividends is based on its future
                          cash flows and net income, investors try to estimate these amounts by examining past
                          trends or forecasting future amounts. The more earnings and the greater amount of
                          cash flow that the company has had, or is expected to have, the lower the uncertainty
                          and risk associated with its ability to pay future dividends.
                               Callable common or preference shares are riskier than their non-callable coun-
                          terparts because the issuer has the option to redeem the shares at a pre-determined
                          price. Because the call price limits investors’ potential future total return, callable
                          shares generally pay a higher dividend to compensate investors for the risk that the
                          shares could be called in the future. Similarly, putable preference shares have lower
                          risk than non-putable preference shares. Cumulative preference shares have lower
                          risk than non-cumulative preference shares because the cumulative feature gives
                          investors the right to receive any unpaid dividends before any dividends can be paid
                          to common shareholders.




              6           EQUITY AND COMPANY VALUE

                          Companies issue equity securities on primary markets to raise capital and increase
                          liquidity. This additional liquidity also provides the corporation an additional “currency”
                          (its equity), which it can use to make acquisitions and provide stock option-based

incentives to employees. The primary goal of raising capital is to finance the company’s
revenue-generating activities in order to increase its net income and maximize the
wealth of its shareholders. In most cases, the capital that is raised is used to finance
the purchase of long-lived assets, capital expansion projects, research and develop-
ment, the entry into new product or geographic regions, and the acquisition of other
companies. Alternatively, a company may be forced to raise capital to ensure that
it continues to operate as a going concern. In these cases, capital is raised to fulfill
regulatory requirements, improve capital adequacy ratios, or to ensure that debt
covenants are met.
    The ultimate goal of management is to increase the book value (shareholders’
equity on a company’s balance sheet) of the company and maximize the market value
of its equity. Although management actions can directly affect the book value of the
company (by increasing net income or by selling or purchasing its own shares), they
can only indirectly affect the market value of its equity. The book value of a company’s
equity—the difference between its total assets and total liabilities—increases when the
company retains its net income. The more net income that is earned and retained, the
greater the company’s book value of equity. Because management’s decisions directly
influence a company’s net income, they also directly influence its book value of equity.
    The market value of the company’s equity, however, reflects the collective and
differing expectations of investors concerning the amount, timing, and uncertainty
of the company’s future cash flows. Rarely will book value and market value be equal.
Although management may be accomplishing its objective of increasing the company’s
book value, this increase may not be reflected in the market value of the company’s
equity because it does not affect investors’ expectations about the company’s future
cash flows. A key measure that investors use to evaluate the effectiveness of man-
agement in increasing the company’s book value is the accounting return on equity.


Accounting Return on Equity
Return on equity (ROE) is the primary measure that equity investors use to determine
whether the management of a company is effectively and efficiently using the capital
they have provided to generate profits. It measures the total amount of net income
available to common shareholders generated by the total equity capital invested in the
company. It is computed as net income available to ordinary shareholders (i.e., after
preferred dividends have been deducted) divided by the average total book value of
equity (BVE). That is:
                      ​NI​t​                   ​NI​t​
   	​ROE​t​ = ___________
              ​​A
                                 ________________
                 verage BVE​​​ = ​  ​	                                            (2)
                               t   ​(​ ​BVE​t​+ ​BVE​t−1​)​​/ 2

where NIt is the net income in year t and the average book value of equity is computed
as the book values at the beginning and end of year t divided by 2. Return on equity
assumes that the net income produced in the current year is generated by the equity
existing at the beginning of the year and any new equity that was invested during the
year. Note that some formulas only use shareholders’ equity at the beginning of year t
(that is, the end of year t – 1) in the denominator. This assumes that only the equity
existing at the beginning of the year was used to generate the company’s net income
during the year. That is:
                 ​NI​t​
   	​ROE​t​ = _
              ​​BVE​ ​​	                                                          (3)
                     t−1

Both formulas are appropriate to use as long as they are applied consistently. For
example, using beginning of the year book value is appropriate when book values
are relatively stable over time or when computing ROE for a company annually over
182   Learning Module 4                                                                                 Overview of Equity Securities


                          a period of time. Average book value is more appropriate if a company experiences
                          more volatile year-end book values or if the industry convention is to use average
                          book values in calculating ROE.
                              One caveat to be aware of when computing and analyzing ROE is that net income
                          and the book value of equity are directly affected by management’s choice of accounting
                          methods, such as those relating to depreciation (straight line versus accelerated meth-
                          ods) or inventories (first in, first out versus weighted average cost). Different accounting
                          methods can make it difficult to compare the return on equity of companies even if
                          they operate in the same industry. It may also be difficult to compare the ROE of the
                          same company over time if its accounting methods have changed during that time.

                          Exhibit 17 summarizes the return on equity for Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline in
                          addition to Pfizer for 2016 and 2017.




                          26 Pfizer uses US GAAP to prepare its financial statements; Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline use International
                          Financial Reporting Standards. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to compare the ROE of Pfizer to that
                          of Novartis or GlaxoSmithKline.

            GlaxoSmithKline

                                    31 Dec 2016 (%)           31 Dec 2017 (%)

         Pfizer                             11.6                     32.5
         Novartis AG                          8.8                    10.3
         GlaxoSmithKline                    12.9                     38.2

In the case of Pfizer, the ROE of 32.5 percent in 2017 indicates that the company was
able to generate a return (profit) of US$0.325 on every US$1.00 of capital invested by
shareholders. GlaxoSmithKline almost tripled its return on equity over this period,
from 12.9 percent to 38.2 percent. Novartis’s ROE remained relatively unchanged.
    ROE can increase if net income increases at a faster rate than shareholders’ equity
or if net income decreases at a slower rate than shareholders’ equity. In the case of
GlaxoSmithKline, ROE almost tripled between 2016 and 2017 due to its net income
almost doubling during the period and due to its average shareholder’s fund decreasing
by almost 45 percent during the period. Stated differently, in 2017 compared to 2016,
GlaxoSmithKline was significantly more effective in using its equity capital to generate
profits. In the case of Pfizer, its ROE increased dramatically from 11.6 percent to 32.5
percent in 2017 versus 2016 even though its average shareholder equity increased by
around 5 percent due to a nearly tripling of net income during the period.
    An important question to ask is whether an increasing ROE is always good. The
short answer is, “it depends.” One reason ROE can increase is if net income decreases
at a slower rate than shareholders’ equity, which is not a positive sign. In addition,
ROE can increase if the company issues debt and then uses the proceeds to repurchase
some of its outstanding shares. This action will increase the company’s leverage and
make its equity riskier. Therefore, it is important to examine the source of changes in
the company’s net income and shareholders’ equity over time. The DuPont formula,
which is discussed in a separate reading, can be used to analyze the sources of changes
in a company’s ROE.
    The book value of a company’s equity reflects the historical operating and financ-
ing decisions of its management. The market value of the company’s equity reflects
these decisions as well as investors’ collective assessment and expectations about the
company’s future cash flows generated by its positive net present value investment
opportunities. If investors believe that the company has a large number of these future
cash flow-generating investment opportunities, the market value of the company’s
equity will exceed its book value. Exhibit 18 shows the market price per share, the total
number of shares outstanding, and the total book value of shareholders’ equity for
Pfizer, Novartis AG, and GlaxoSmithKline at the end of December 2017. This exhibit
also shows the total market value of equity (or market capitalization) computed as the
number of shares outstanding multiplied by the market price per share.

                          Note that in Exhibit 18, the total market value of equity for Pfizer is computed as:
                             Market value of equity = Market price per share × Shares outstanding

                             Market value of equity = US$35.74 × 5,952,900 = US$212,756,646.
                          The book value of equity per share for Pfizer can be computed as:
                             Book value of equity per share = Total shareholders’ equity/Shares outstanding

                             Book value of equity per share = US$71,287,000/5,952,900 = US$11.98.
                          A useful ratio to compute is a company’s price-to-book ratio, which is also referred
                          to as the market-to-book ratio. This ratio provides an indication of investors’ expec-
                          tations about a company’s future investment and cash flow-generating opportunities.
                          The larger the price-to-book ratio (i.e., the greater the divergence between market
                          value per share and book value per share), the more favorably investors will view
                          the company’s future investment opportunities. For Pfizer the price-to-book ratio is:
                             Price-to-book ratio = Market price per share/Book value of equity per share

                             Price-to-book ratio = US$35.74/US$11.98= 2.98
                          Exhibit 19 contains the market price per share, book value of equity per share, and
                          price-to-book ratios for Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline in addition to Pfizer.

                          The market price per share of all three companies exceeds their respective book values,
                          so their price-to-book ratios are all greater than 1.00. However, there are significant
                          differences in the sizes of their price-to-book ratios. GlaxoSmithKline has the largest
                          price-to-book ratio, while the price-to-book ratios of Pfizer and Novartis are similar to
                          each other. This suggests that investors believe that GlaxoSmithKline has substantially
                          higher future growth opportunities than either Pfizer or Novartis.
                              It is not appropriate to compare the price-to-book ratios of companies in different
                          industries because their price-to-book ratios also reflect investors’ outlook for the
                          industry. Companies in high growth industries, such as technology, will generally
                          have higher price-to-book ratios than companies in slower growth (i.e., mature)
                          industries, such as heavy equipment. Therefore, it is more appropriate to compare the
                          price-to-book ratios of companies in the same industry. A company with relatively
                          high growth opportunities compared to its industry peers would likely have a higher
                          price-to-book ratio than the average price-to-book ratio of the industry.
                              Book value and return on equity are useful in helping analysts determine value but
                          can be limited as a primary means to estimate a company’s true or intrinsic value, which
                          is the present value of its future projected cash flows. In Exhibit 20, Warren Buffett,
                          one of the most successful investors in the world and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway,
                          provides an explanation of the differences between the book value of a company
                          and its intrinsic value in a letter to shareholders. As discussed above, market value
                          reflects the collective and differing expectations of investors concerning the amount,
                          timing, and uncertainty of a company’s future cash flows. A company’s intrinsic value
                          can only be estimated because it is impossible to predict the amount and timing of
Equity and Company Value                                                                     185


its future cash flows. However, astute investors—such as Buffett—have been able to
profit from discrepancies between their estimates of a company’s intrinsic value and
the market value of its equity.

 Exhibit 20: Book Value versus Intrinsic Value27

   We regularly report our per-share book value, an easily calculable number, though
   one of limited use. Just as regularly, we tell you that what counts is intrinsic value,
   a number that is impossible to pinpoint but essential to estimate.
        For example, in 1964, we could state with certitude that Berkshire’s per-
   share book value was $19.46. However, that figure considerably overstated the
   stock’s intrinsic value since all of the company’s resources were tied up in a
   sub-profitable textile business. Our textile assets had neither going-concern nor
   liquidation values equal to their carrying values. In 1964, then, anyone inquiring
   into the soundness of Berkshire’s balance sheet might well have deserved the
   answer once offered up by a Hollywood mogul of dubious reputation: “Don’t
   worry, the liabilities are solid.”
        Today, Berkshire’s situation has reversed: Many of the businesses we control
   are worth far more than their carrying value. (Those we don’t control, such as
   Coca-Cola or Gillette, are carried at current market values.) We continue to give
   you book value figures, however, because they serve as a rough, understated,
   tracking measure for Berkshire’s intrinsic value.
        We define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the cash that can be
   taken out of a business during its remaining life. Anyone calculating intrinsic
   value necessarily comes up with a highly subjective figure that will change both
   as estimates of future cash flows are revised and as interest rates move. Despite
   its fuzziness, however, intrinsic value is all-important and is the only logical way
   to evaluate the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses.
        To see how historical input (book value) and future output (intrinsic value)
   can diverge, let’s look at another form of investment, a college education. Think
   of the education’s cost as its “book value.” If it is to be accurate, the cost should
   include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college
   rather than a job.
        For this exercise, we will ignore the important non-economic benefits of an
   education and focus strictly on its economic value. First, we must estimate the
   earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that
   figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education.
   That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must then be discounted, at an
   appropriate interest rate, back to graduation day. The dollar result equals the
   intrinsic economic value of the education.



The Cost of Equity and Investors’ Required Rates of Return
When companies issue debt (or borrow from a bank) or equity securities, there is a
cost associated with the capital that is raised. In order to maximize profitability and
shareholder wealth, companies attempt to raise capital efficiently so as to minimize
these costs.
    When a company issues debt, the cost it incurs for the use of these funds is called
the cost of debt. The cost of debt is relatively easy to estimate because it reflects the
periodic interest (or coupon) rate that the company is contractually obligated to pay

                          to its bondholders (lenders). When a company raises capital by issuing equity, the
                          cost it incurs is called the cost of equity. Unlike debt, however, the company is not
                          contractually obligated to make any payments to its shareholders for the use of their
                          funds. As a result, the cost of equity is more difficult to estimate.
                               Investors require a return on the funds they provide to the company. This return
                          is called the investor’s minimum required rate of return. When investors purchase
                          the company’s debt securities, their minimum required rate of return is the periodic
                          rate of interest they charge the company for the use of their funds. Because all of the
                          bondholders receive the same periodic rate of interest, their required rate of return is
                          the same. Therefore, the company’s cost of debt and the investors’ minimum required
                          rate of return on the debt are the same.
                               When investors purchase the company’s equity securities, their minimum required
                          rate of return is based on the future cash flows they expect to receive. Because these
                          future cash flows are both uncertain and unknown, the investors’ minimum required
                          rate of return must be estimated. In addition, the minimum required return may
                          differ across investors based on their expectations about the company’s future cash
                          flows. As a result, the company’s cost of equity may be different from the investors’
                          minimum required rate of return on equity.28 Because companies try to raise capital
                          at the lowest possible cost, the company’s cost of equity is often used as a proxy for
                          the investors’ minimum required rate of return.
                               In other words, the cost of equity can be thought of as the minimum expected rate
                          of return that a company must offer its investors to purchase its shares in the primary
                          market and to maintain its share price in the secondary market. If this expected rate
                          of return is not maintained in the secondary market, then the share price will adjust
                          so that it meets the minimum required rate of return demanded by investors. For
                          example, if investors require a higher rate of return on equity than the company’s cost
                          of equity, they would sell their shares and invest their funds elsewhere resulting in a
                          decline in the company’s share price. As the share price declined, the cost of equity
                          would increase to reach the higher rate of return that investors require.
                               Two models commonly used to estimate a company’s cost of equity (or investors’
                          minimum required rate of return) are the dividend discount model (DDM) and the
                          capital asset pricing model (CAPM). These models are discussed in detail in other
                          curriculum readings.
                               The cost of debt (after tax) and the cost of equity (i.e., the minimum required
                          rates of return on debt and equity) are integral components of the capital budgeting
                          process because they are used to estimate a company’s weighted average cost of cap-
                          ital (WACC). Capital budgeting is the decision-making process that companies use
                          to evaluate potential long-term investments. The WACC represents the minimum
                          required rate of return that the company must earn on its long-term investments to
                          satisfy all providers of capital. The company then chooses among those long-term
                          investments with expected returns that are greater than its WACC.

                          of the need for equity capital in developed and emerging markets, technological
                          innovation, and the growing sophistication of electronic information exchange. Given

their absolute return potential and ability to impact the risk and return characteristics
of portfolios, equity securities are of importance to both individual and institutional
investors.
    This reading introduces equity securities and provides an overview of global equity
markets. A detailed analysis of their historical performance shows that equity securities
have offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds, which
have provided average real annual returns that have only kept pace with inflation. The
different types and characteristics of common and preference equity securities are
examined, and the primary differences between public and private equity securities
are outlined. An overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded
in global markets is provided, including a discussion of their risk and return charac-
teristics. Finally, the role of equity securities in creating company value is examined
as well as the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its accounting return
on equity, investors’ required rate of return, and the company’s intrinsic value.
    We conclude with a summary of the key components of this reading:
   ■   Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give
       investors a claim on its operating performance, the opportunity to partici-
       pate in the corporate decision-making process, and a claim on the compa-
       ny’s net assets in the case of liquidation.
   ■   Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares
       from shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally
       issued.
   ■   Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to
       the issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued.
   ■   Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to prefer-
       ence shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common
       stockholders.
   ■   Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend
       payments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must
       be paid before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders.
       Non-cumulative preference shares have no such provisions, implying that
       the dividend payments are at the company’s discretion and are thus similar
       to payments made to common shareholders.
   ■   Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard pre-
       ferred dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits
       above a pre-specified amount. Non-participating preference shares allow
       investors to simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends
       in the event of liquidation.
   ■   Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with
       the same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts.
   ■   Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in
       private placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets. There are
       three types of private equity investments: venture capital, leveraged buyouts,
       and private investments in public equity (PIPE).
   ■   The objective of private equity investing is to increase the ability of the com-
       pany’s management to focus on its operating activities for long-term value
       creation. The strategy is to take the “private” company “public” after certain
       profit and other benchmarks have been met.

                          ■   Depository receipts are securities that trade like ordinary shares on a local
                              exchange but which represent an economic interest in a foreign company.
                              They allow the publicly listed shares of foreign companies to be traded on an
                              exchange outside their domestic market.
                          ■   American depository receipts are US dollar-denominated securities trading
                              much like standard US securities on US markets. Global depository receipts
                              are similar to ADRs but contain certain restrictions in terms of their ability
                              to be resold among investors.
                          ■   Underlying characteristics of equity securities can greatly affect their risk
                              and return.
                          ■   A company’s accounting return on equity is the total return that it earns on
                              shareholders’ book equity.
                          ■   A company’s cost of equity is the minimum rate of return that stockholders
                              require the company to pay them for investing in its equity.

                          10. A is correct. The listing fees on Level III sponsored ADRs are high.

                          11. C is correct. An ETF is used to gain exposure to a basket of securities (equity,

                          12. A is correct. The formula states Rt = (Pt – Pt–1 + Dt)/Pt–1. Therefore, total return
                              = (42 – 50 + 2)/50 = –12.0%.

                          13. A is correct. The depreciated value of the euro will create an additional loss in the
                              form of currency return that is lower than the ETF’s return.

                          14. C is correct. Some equity securities do not pay dividends, and therefore the
                              standard deviation of dividends cannot be used to measure the risk of all equity
                              securities.

                          15. A is correct. Putable shares, whether common or preference, give the investor
                              the option to sell the shares back to the issuer at a pre-determined price. This
                              pre-determined price creates a floor for the share’s price that reduces the uncer-
                              tainty of future cash flows for the investor (i.e., lowers risk relative to the other
                              two types of shares listed).

                          16. C is correct. Issuing shares in the primary (and secondary) market reduces a com-
                              pany’s return on equity because it increases the total amount of equity capital
                              invested in the company (i.e., the denominator in the ROE formula).

                          17. C is correct. Capital is raised to ensure the company’s existence only when it is
Solutions                                                                                  195


   required. It is not a typical goal of raising capital.

18. A is correct. A company’s book value increases when a company retains its net
    income.

19. A is correct. The book value of the company is equal to total assets minus total
    liabilities, which is €12,000,000 – €7,500,000 = €4,500,000.

20. A is correct. A company’s market value is affected by management’s decisions.
    Management’s decisions can directly affect the company’s book value, which can
    then affect its market value.

21. B is correct. A company’s ROE is calculated as (NIt/BVEt–1). The BVEt–1
    is equal to the beginning total assets minus the beginning total liabilities,
    which equals £50,000,000 – £35,000,000 = £15,000,000. Therefore, ROE =
    £2,000,000/£15,000,000 = 13.3%.

22. C is correct. A company’s ROE will increase if it issues debt to repurchase out-
    standing shares of equity.

23. B is correct. The cost of equity is not easily determined. It is dependent on inves-
    tors’ required rate of return on equity, which reflects the different risk levels of
    investors and their expectations about the company’s future cash flows.

24. B is correct. Companies try to raise funds at the lowest possible cost. Therefore,
    cost of equity is used as a proxy for the minimum required rate of return.

INTRODUCTION
An insightful and well-written company research report helps investors understand
                                                                                        1
a company and make better investment decisions about the company’s securities.
This module is the first of three that will provide a framework to prepare a company
research report by applying methods covered in previous modules to assess a com-
pany’s business model, financial performance, and financial position.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Company research reports analyze a company’s past and pres-
          ent financials, its industry and competitors, and forecast its
          future financial statements. Reports end with a valuation, an invest-
          ment recommendation, and investment risks.
      ■   The first step of company analysis requires an understanding of the
          issuer’s business model, for which analysts rely on both issuer and
          third-party information sources.
      ■   An understanding of the issuer’s business model and analysis of histor-
          ical financial statements will allow the analyst to identify key drivers of
          revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial position.
198   Learning Module 5                                                       Company Analysis: Past and Present


                              ■   Revenue analysis can be done using a bottom-up or top-down
                                  approach. A bottom-up approach breaks down revenues into driv-
                                  ers such as sales volumes and prices, by product line or segment. A
                                  top-down approach expresses revenue as a function of drivers such as
                                  market share, market size, and GDP growth.
                              ■   While a company can change its prices at will, its ability to do so
                                  successfully (i.e., not causing a loss of volume) and relative to costs is
                                  driven by the company’s pricing power. Pricing power is primarily a
                                  function of industry structure and competitive strategy.
                              ■   Cost analysis assesses a company’s profitability and working capital
                                  management. Analysts calculate and interpret several cost and profit-
                                  ability measures, including gross, operating, and net margins.
                              ■   While a fixed versus variable cost analysis is useful, the analysis is
                                  often limited by issuer disclosures and accounting standards that
                                  emphasize cost reporting by function or nature.
                              ■   The degree of operating leverage measures the sensitivity of operating
                                  profit to changes in sales. Operating leverage is primarily driven by the
                                  fixed and variable cost composition of the issuer’s operating expenses.
                              ■   The degree of financial leverage measures the sensitivity of net income
                                  to changes in operating income. Financial leverage is primarily driven
                                  by the issuer’s capital structure.




                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. Identify two elements that are common to all company research reports and
                              two elements that are common to initial research reports.
                             Solution:
                             Common to all research reports:

                              ■   Analyst’s investment recommendation and target buy or sell prices
                              ■   Risks such as evaluation of material downside and upside risks
                             Common to initial research reports:

                              ■   Discussion of issuer’s business model and strategy, and explanatory
                                  charts and figures that disaggregate revenues and profits by product or
                                  geography
                              ■   Detailed financial analysis and models
                              ■   Industry overview and competitive positioning such as industry size,
                                  growth rate, market share trends, and industry profitability. Evaluation
                                  of the company’s competitive position and strategy in each product
                                  line or segment is also common.
Introduction                                                                         199


  2. Identify three information sources that analysts commonly use to determine
     and analyze a company’s business model.
     Solution:

      ■   Regulatory filings if the issuer is public, especially the annual and
          quarterly reports
      ■   Investor events and presentations by the issuer
      ■   Visiting the company’s properties and/or websites


  3. Last year, a distributor of dental care products earned EUR800 million in
     revenues. Management estimated that its market share was 10%. Based on
     management’s estimate, the market size for distribution of dental care prod-
     ucts in this geography last year was closest to (in millions of EUR):
      A. 80
      B. 7,200
      C. 8,000
     Solution:
     C is correct.
                         Revenue
      	​Market share = _
                       ​Market Size ​

     Which can be rearranged to:
                        Revenue
      	​Market size = _
                      ​Market Share ​

                      EUR 800 million
                      _____________
      	​Market size =   
                      ​    10%        ​

      	​Market size = EUR 8, 000 million (​ 8 billion)​


  4. A beverage manufacturer recently introduced a new line of healthy tea-
     based drinks. The average selling price was USD20 a case last year and the
     company sold 2 million cases. This year, an analyst forecasts sales of 3 mil-
     lion cases and an increase in the average selling price—from a reduction in
     discounts and promotions—of 5%. The analyst’s forecast for net sales growth
     this year over the prior year is closest to:
      A. 50%
      B. 55%
      C. 58%
     Solution:
     C is correct.
      Net sales = average selling price × cases sold

      Net sales last year = USD20 × 2 million = USD40 million

      Net sales forecast this year = (USD20 × 1.05) × 3 million = USD63 million

      Forecasted net sales growth rate = 63/40 − 1 = 0.575 or 58%


  5. Impression Ltd. is a fictional company that designs, manufactures, and sells
     skin care and beauty products. Identify whether each expense line below
200   Learning Module 5                                                     Company Analysis: Past and Present


                            from Impression Ltd.’s last annual income statement is most likely a fixed or
                            variable cost.
                                                                     ​




                           I. Amortization of acquired intangible           Fixed            Variable
                           assets
                           II. Interest expense                             Fixed            Variable
                           III. Costs of goods sold                         Fixed            Variable
                           IV. General and administrative expenses          Fixed            Variable
                           V. Sales commissions                             Fixed            Variable
                                                                     ​




                            Solution:
                            I. Fixed. Amortization expense generally does not change with levels of sales
                            volume, as definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
                            basis over the assets’ useful lives.
                            II. Fixed. Interest expense is a function of the quantity of debt and its inter-
                            est rate, not sales volume.
                            III. Variable. Costs of goods sold are incurred when sales are made.
                            IV. Fixed. General and administrative expenses are usually not related to
                            sales volume each year.
                            V. Variable. Sales commissions, a form of performance-based compensation
                            for salespeople, are a function of sales and are therefore variable.

                          6. Based on the data below, the degree of operating leverage for Company XYZ
                             for the year ended 31 December 20X1 is closest to:
                                                                     ​

                           Costs of goods sold                                4,850            4,637

                                                                     ​




                             A. 0.51
                             B. 1.08
                            C. 1.96
                            C is correct.
                             20X1 Operating Income = 9,707 – 4,850 – 993 – 1,700 – 491 = 1,673

                             20X0 Operating Income = 9,256 – 4,637 – 1,090 – 1,554 – 448 = 1,527

                             DOL = % Δ Operating Income/% Δ Sales

                             DOL = (1,673/1,527 – 1)/(9,707/9,256 − 1)
Company Research Reports                                                                      201


      DOL = 1.96
     A is incorrect, as it inverts the equation; it is the ratio of the change in sales
     to the change in operating income.
     B is incorrect; it is the ratio of the percentage change in pre-tax income,
     rather than operating income, to the percentage change in sales.

  7. If a company reported trailing 12 months’ operating cash flow of USD150
     million, current assets excluding cash of USD40 million, and current liabili-
     ties of USD60 million, the company most likely:
      A. was inefficient in managing its financing.
      B. used trade credit to manage working capital.
      C. over-extended itself and is at risk of bankruptcy.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Negative net working capital typically indicates that the compa-
     ny uses suppliers’ trade credit to lengthen days payable, while also efficiently
     managing inventory days and days sales outstanding.
     A is incorrect. Negative working capital is a source rather than a use of
     financing and gives an issuer more financial flexibility, as capital is not tied
     up in working capital.
     C is incorrect. There is not enough information here to determine bankrupt-
     cy risk, but positive operating cash flows and negative net working capital
     are not bankruptcy risk indicators.

  8. A company’s management may choose not to use financial leverage because
     the company has:
      A. an investment-grade credit rating.
      B. a high degree of operating leverage.
      C. a lower net debt to EBITDA ratio than its peers.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The degree of financial leverage and the degree of operating
     leverage together equal the degree of total leverage in the business. If the
     company already has a high degree of operating leverage, using financial
     leverage may increase total leverage and risk to too high a level.
     A is incorrect. An investment-grade credit rating generally indicates that
     the company could borrow economically, which would be a reason to use
     financial leverage.
     C is incorrect. A lower net debt to EBITDA ratio than its peers is an indica-
     tor of borrowing capacity, which would be a reason to use financial leverage.

                          Analysts value and make investment recommendations on issuers’ equity securities
                          using scenarios of future earnings, cash flows, and financial position. These future
                          scenarios are structured in the form of financial statements and are known as financial
                          statement models. While a financial statement model is quantitative, it is not a math-
                          ematics problem to solve with a correct answer, but rather a quantitative expression
                          of an analyst’s forward-looking views. These views should be based on supporting
                          evidence and justified by analysis.
                              The process of forming and justifying a view of an issuer’s future financial results
                          and position involves company and industry analysis and is the subject of this module
                          and the next two. Exhibit 1 introduces a framework for company and industry analysis.
                          This module focuses on the foundational block Company Analysis: Past and Present.

                          Analysts present their company and industry analysis, as well as their valuation and
                          investment recommendation, in a company research report. The structure, content,
                          and tone of the report depend on the analyst’s setting. Reports on a public issuer’s
                          equity securities for distribution to external clients (a “sell-side report”), for example,
                          often consist of an extensive initial report (an “initiating coverage” report, or “initia-
                          tion”) when the analyst begins covering the security, followed by shorter reports on
                          specific topics or that make updates to a recommendation after the analyst receives
                          new information or conducts additional analyses, particularly after the issuer reports
                          financial results. Analysts’ reports solely for internal distribution to an audience already
                          familiar with the issuer might be far shorter and delivered verbally or in a handful of
                          presentation slides.
                              An example of the structure of an initial company research report for external
                          distribution is shown in Exhibit 2. The primary audience is those who are not already
                          knowledgeable about the issuer or security.

THE CFA INSTITUTE RESEARCH CHALLENGE

   For examples of initial company research reports, we encourage you to visit the
   Past Research Challenge Champions section of cfainstitute.org, which has win-
   ning reports and presentations from the research competition that CFA Institute
   and CFA Societies around the world host each year. Teams of university students
   are assigned a public company to research by a local CFA Society and compete on
   the quality of their research and modeling, valuation, and communication skills.

    Subsequent company research reports are often shorter than initial reports. Their
primary audience is those who are already familiar with the issuer or security and
require an update based on new information and analyses or a change in the ana-
lyst’s recommendation. Such a report for a company that recently reported quarterly
financial results may be structured in the form shown in Exhibit 3. The structure of
a subsequent report depends on the analyst’s setting and the nature of the report.

                          QUESTION SET


                             1. Which of the following statements about initiation reports is true?
                                  A. The structure, content, and tone of the report are independent of the
                                     analyst’s setting.
                                  B. The report makes updates to the recommendation after the issuer
                                     reports financial results.
                                   C. The primary audience is those who are not already knowledgeable
                                      about the issuer or security.
                                  Solution:
                                  C is correct. The primary audience is those who are not already knowledge-
                                  able about the issuer or security.
                                  A is incorrect, because the structure, content, and tone of the report are
                                  dependent on the analyst’s setting. Examples include whether the report
                                  is meant for internal or external distribution and whether it is an in-depth
                                  initiation report or a subsequent report updating the reader after a change
                                  in recommendation or the release of the issuer’s quarterly results.
                                  B is incorrect, because the initial report is to help those who are not already
                                  knowledgeable to understand the issuer or security. A subsequent research
                                  report is used to update the audience after the release of financial results.

                             2. If you read a research report that includes both a Porter’s Five Forces analy-
                                sis and a PESTLE analysis, then most likely:
                                  A. the authoring analyst is initiating coverage.
                                  B. the report is updating a recommendation after an earnings release.
Determining the Business Model                                                              205


       C. the report is written by a firm’s analyst who has covered the company
          for many years.
      Solution:
      A is correct. A Porter’s Five Forces analysis and a PESTLE analysis are com-
      mon elements in initiations and are less common in subsequent research
      reports, as they tend to evolve more slowly than other report elements such
      as financial analyses and models.
      B and C are incorrect; these elements are common in subsequent rather
      than initial research reports.

   3. The evaluation of a company’s competitive strategy takes place before the:
      A. analysis of revenue and revenue drivers.
      B. analysis of operating profitability and working capital.
       C. forecasting of revenue, operating profitability, and working capital.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Forecasting takes place only after company analysis and indus-
      try and competitive analysis are complete. The evaluation of a company’s
      competitive strategy is part of the industry and competitive analysis.
      A is incorrect, because the analysis of revenue and revenue drivers is part of
      the first stage of analysis, where the analyst studies the company’s past and
      present financial statements. As we shall see in Lesson 3, analysts start by
      analyzing the revenue line items first.
      B is incorrect, because the analysis of operating profitability and working
      capital typically takes place before the industry and competitive analysis.
      The evaluation of the company’s competitive strategy is usually part of the
      industry and company analysis, which takes place after completion of the
      analysis of operating profitability and working capital.




DETERMINING THE BUSINESS MODEL
                                                                                        3
              determine a company’s business model

Determining the business model is the first step in our industry and company analysis
framework because it summarizes important drivers of an issuer’s financial results
and position, focuses the analyst on what requires further investigation, and should
begin setting the analyst’s expectations for the issuer. A discussion of the business
model is usually in the first part of a company research report (see the “Company
Description” section in Exhibit 2).
    Recall that a business model describes a company’s operations and includes the
following elements, which analysts investigate by answering several key questions
discussed in prior learning modules.

                          Sales channels, including customer              How does the company reach potential and
                          acquisition and product/service delivery        current customers and how does it deliver
                          mechanisms                                      products?
                          How the product(s) or service(s) are priced     How much does the company charge
                          and paid for                                    and how are prices and payment terms
                                                                          structured?
                          Resource, supplier, and partner relationships   What does the company buy and rely on?
                          need to operate effectively

                          There are many corollary questions for each of the key questions, such as determining
                          whether customers are few and concentrated, whether suppliers and resources are
                          specialized or hard to replace, and so on. The answers to these questions are company
                          specific, but the key questions to ask are common across industries and companies.
                          Also, recall that many companies have a conventional business model, such as retailer
                          or natural resource producer, which simplifies business model identification in prac-
                          tice. Analysts will often focus their analysis on the differences in a company’s business
                          model, if any, from a conventional model or those of its competitors.
                              Information sources that analysts use to answer these questions include the fol-
                          lowing, grouped by origin: the issuer, public third party, proprietary third party, and
                          proprietary primary research.
                              ■   Issuer sources (available freely if the company is public)

                                  ●   Regulatory filings, especially the annual and quarterly reports
                                  ●   Quarterly or semi-annual earnings conference calls
                                  ●   Presentations and events for investors

                                  ●   Company website or properties that the analyst may be able to visit
                                      as either a customer or an investor. It is often useful to experience an
                                      issuer’s and its competitors’ products firsthand, though it is not always
                                      possible (e.g., pharmaceuticals).
                              ■   Public third-party sources

                                  ●   Free industry white papers or analyst reports from a consultancy
                                  ●   Economic or industry indicators from governments and other
                                      organizations
                                  ●   General news outlets
                                  ●   Industry-specific news outlets
                                  ●   Social media
                                  ●   Miscellaneous sources available via search engines
                              ■   Proprietary third-party sources

                                  ●   Analyst reports and communications, including from “sell-side” or “Wall
                                      Street” analysts and credit rating agencies
                                  ●   Reports and data from platforms such as Bloomberg and FactSet
                                  ●   Reports and data from consultancies, often industry specific, such as
                                      Rystad in energy, IQVIA and Evaluate in biopharma, Gartner and IDC in
                                      information technology

Determining the Business Model                                                             207


       ●   Surveys, conversations, product comparisons, and other studies commis-
           sioned by the analyst or conducted directly
     Analysts in an institutional investment setting (e.g., an asset management firm)
are often able to conduct this initial research quickly, as they enjoy broad access to a
variety of proprietary third-party sources, may have industry knowledge and experi-
ence themselves, can access prior analyses of the company or industry, and often have
access to the issuer investor relations personnel and management.
     We will demonstrate the determination of an issuer’s business model with a fic-
tional example adapted from a real company. We will use this case study throughout
this module and the next two to demonstrate the use of the company and industry
analysis framework. Another case study of a different company in the same industry
is in the self-assessment section at the end of each lesson, so you can practice using
the framework on your own.

CASE STUDIES

  Warehouse Club Inc.
  Elaine Nguyen is an analyst at Fyleton Investments. To find investment
  candidates for one of Fyleton’s funds, Nguyen ran a screen for compa-
  nies in developed markets that exceeded a certain level of sales growth
  and return on invested capital over the last five years while also performing
  well in the last recession. One company that passed the screen is Warehouse
  Club Inc. (“Warehouse”). Neither Nguyen nor her colleagues have ever worked
  on Warehouse before. A portfolio manager suggested that Nguyen research the
  company and its industry for several days and then discuss initial findings with
  colleagues before writing a formal research report.
     Warehouse is a public company, so Nguyen compiles several issuer informa-
  tion sources, including the company’s latest annual report and a transcript of
  management’s presentation at a recent investor event. The following paragraphs
  and figures are excerpts from these sources.
       Warehouse Club Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “the company”) is a leading discount
       retailer, consistently offering customers more than 20% savings on a broad
       range of food and other merchandise compared to supermarket, depart-
       ment store, convenience store, and e-commerce competitors. Warehouse
       operated 149, 145, and 141 stores as of 31 December 2X19, 2X18, and
       2X17, respectively.
           We sell a core assortment of packaged food and beverages, fresh foods,
       and non-food merchandise such as apparel, appliances, electronics and
       entertainment, housewares, and sporting goods. In addition to our core
       assortment, our stores feature a changing assortment of seasonal or dis-
       counted items based on the latest consumer trends and availability from
       suppliers, which vary by store. We also offer ancillary products and services
       such as petrol stations co-located with our stores, in-store takeaway pre-
       pared foods, pharmacy and optician centers, and hearing aids. In addition
       to carrying the leading branded goods, we also sell packaged food and
       household goods under our exclusive private-label brand that we source
       from contract manufacturers, which account for over 15% of our net sales
       and carry higher than average profitability.
           We operate a member-based model that requires customers to show
       their membership card to enter and shop in our stores. The annual mem-
       bership fee is $60 per household. We estimate that members’ annual savings
       versus shopping at competitors for the same basket of goods amounts to
       over five times their annual membership fee. Our membership fee revenues

                          were $601, $576, and $553 million in fiscal years 2X19, 2X18, and 2X17,
                          respectively. Besides providing us with a source of recurring revenue,
                          membership engenders shopper loyalty and drives our industry-low levels
                          of inventory theft of less than 20 basis points as a percentage of net sales,
                          which we believe is at least one-fifth that of competitors. Total member-
                          ships were 10.2, 9.8, and 9.4 million as of 31 December 2X19, 2X18, and
                          2X17, respectively.
                              Our strategy is based on price and cost leadership. We stock a limited
                          selection of high-quality branded and private-label products in a wide
                          range of categories that produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory
                          turnover. We limit items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors and carry
                          an average of approximately 4,000 unique products per store, less than a
                          quarter of the assortment of our supermarket and supercenter competi-
                          tors. Most items are sold only in bulk sizes. Wherever possible, we utilize
                          direct-from-manufacturer distribution and move merchandise immediately
                          to the sales floor, presenting on pallets in a no-frills warehouse atmosphere.
                          Our high-volume purchases of a limited number of products, direct from
                          manufacturer distribution, and reduced handling of merchandise enable us
                          to hold a low-cost position in the retail industry in terms of merchandise
                          and labor costs. Our low costs and membership fee revenues enable us
                          to operate profitably while charging significantly lower prices than other
                          retailers. Low prices for quality products drive greater membership and net
                          sales over time, leveraging our selling, general, and administrative expenses,
                          reducing them as a percentage of net sales.
                              Our stores operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week with predictable shifts
                          for employees. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retail-
                          ers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation,
                          labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. We look to maintain
                          a large base of full-time employees with above-average wages and benefits
                          to establish long tenures, as we believe this maximizes productivity and
                          customer service at our stores. Our employee retention rate for employ-
                          ees who have been with us for at least a year is 90%, which we believe is
                          substantially higher than the retail industry average.
                              Our retail operations, which represent substantially all our consolidated
                          net sales, are our only reportable segment. We do not have significant sales
                          outside our domestic geography: the United States. No single customer or
                          supplier represents a material amount of revenues or merchandise costs,
                          respectively.

                           During its presentation at a recent investor event, Warehouse management
                           made the following statements that were not in the annual report:
                              ■   Three years ago, the company launched “Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store,”
                                  which enables members to shop on Warehouse’s website or mobile
                                  app and pick up their order, assembled by Warehouse employees, at
                                  a store. The company does not plan to offer e-commerce or delivery
                                  itself or through third-party services.
                              ■   Membership is $60 per year, paid upfront, and refundable on a pro-
                                  rated basis for days remaining in the year. Management has increased
                                  the price of membership every five years by $5 and expects to continue
                                  to do so. The last price increase was three years ago.
                              ■   Management intends to open four new stores per year for the next five
                                  years.
                              ■   The company operates stores in urban and suburban areas in a single
                                  country. Over 90% of current members live within 10 kilometers of a
                                  store, and while membership has grown around existing stores over
                                  time, management believes the primary driver of membership growth
                                  is opening stores in new areas.
                              ■   Management does not plan to open stores in another country for the
                                  foreseeable future. An immaterial amount of merchandise is imported.

                           Determining Warehouse Club Inc.’s Business Model
                           Nguyen answers the following questions to determine Warehouse Club Inc.’s
                           business model and to identify areas to conduct further research.
                              ■   What is the firm selling?
                               Warehouse sells a range of consumer goods, mostly consumables and per-
                           ishables, approximately 4,000 unique items. For customers to shop at the stores,
                           they must hold a membership, which Warehouse sells for $60 per year, per house-
                           hold. Nguyen graphs the following net sales by category data with descriptions
                           supplied by Warehouse, and notes that the composition of net sales by category
                           has not changed materially in the last 10 years.
Determining the Business Model                                                               211

                                                                    40%

                                                          13%
      “Non-food merchandise” includes a broad range of items such as appliances,
  electronics, health and personal care products, hardware, outdoor and sporting
  goods, jewelry, furniture, and housewares.
      “Ancillary and other” are service businesses that operate in or next to
  Warehouse’s stores and include takeaway prepared foods, prescription phar-
  macies, petrol stations, optician centers, and hearing aids.
      ■   To whom?
      Warehouse’s members are primarily consumer households that live within 10
  kilometers of a store, are value-conscious, are willing to forgo a more extensive
  selection for lower unit prices on bulk-sized goods, and are able to afford the
  annual membership fee.
      ■ How?
      Warehouse sells products and services both in and around its stores. Members
  can either shop at the store or shop online and pick up at the store (Nguyen
  notes that management did not disclose the size of this in terms of net sales).
  Management said that it does minimal advertising (besides promotional mail) in
  an area before it opens a store and also sends out membership renewal reminders;
  the company primarily relies on word of mouth and its stores’ physical presence
  to drive interest and foot traffic.
      Memberships can be purchased online, by phone, or at any Warehouse store.
  Management said that over three-quarters of members purchase and renew
  their memberships online.
      ■ For how much?
      Warehouse has two revenue streams: goods and services (for which it earns
  net sales) and membership (for which it earns membership fees).
      Management sets the prices of its merchandise by item. Gross margin and
  markup on aggregate net sales for the last three fiscal years were as follows:
                                                  ​

                               Therefore, the average good or service is sold at a price that is a little over
                           12% of the cost for Warehouse to purchase and ready the item for sale. While
                           management claims that the company is a cost and price leader, Nguyen will
                           have to corroborate that.
                               Membership is $60 per year, per household. Membership is required to shop
                           at Warehouse stores, thus effectively raising the price of all its goods and services.
                               ■   What does the company buy and rely on to operate effectively?
                                   ●   Merchandise from a broad range of manufacturers and private-la-
                                       bel goods from contract manufacturers
                                   ●   Human capital in stores and in management
                                   ●   Fixed assets including land in attractive locations, buildings,
                                       fixtures, refrigerators and freezers, and a range of information
                                       technology systems such as point-of-sale payment systems
                                   ●   Credit and debit card payment networks and financial institutions
                                       to receive and make electronic payments
                               While these are all broadly available and the company has not had supply
                           or service interruptions in the past, a key partner appears to be merchandise
                           manufacturers, particularly those that manufacture Warehouse’s private-label
                           products. Since Warehouse is strict on cost and quality and carries a limited
                           selection, the company does rely heavily on these contract manufacturers.
                               In summary, Warehouse’s business model is aimed at creating a virtuous
                           cycle whereby low prices drive memberships, which drive further sales, which
                           drive negotiating leverage with suppliers to enable low prices at low costs.

                          QUESTION SET

                           Iliso Marketplace Ltd. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Iliso”) is
                           redefining e-commerce by delivering superior customer experiences
                           at competitive prices through our Iliso Marketplace mobile app and website.
                           While e-commerce customers have historically been forced to compromise on
                           shipping times, product quality, and hassles with returns, we’ve built a verti-
                           cally integrated system that delivers a vast selection of products with one-day
                           delivery on most orders. We continue to make significant investments in both
                           technology and our fulfillment infrastructure to improve the customer expe-
                           rience and expand into new product categories and geographies.
                               Customer Experience
Determining the Business Model                                                       213


    We’re committed to delighting our customers every day. Hallmarks of our
  customer experience include:
      ■   Next-Day or Faster Delivery. Customers are eligible for one-day deliv-
          ery 365 days a year. In 2X19, over 93% of orders were delivered within
          24 hours of receiving the order.
      ■   Free Shipping. Customers are eligible for free shipping on orders
          greater than $25, which we believe is the industry-leading minimum
          order threshold, and no membership fee is required.
      ■   Vast Selection of Items, Including Fresh Groceries. Customers can
          order from a selection of items across almost every category of
          goods—from fresh produce to consumer electronics to home décor
          and furniture. To continue offering the highest-quality items, we mod-
          ify our selection continuously based on customer reviews. We enforce
          strict standards for third-party merchants to protect customers from
          counterfeit goods.
      ■   Frictionless Returns. Our customers simply tap a button on our app
          and leave the item outside their door for pickup. Refunds are initiated
          the moment the item is picked up at the door.
     The number of active customer accounts as of the fourth quarter for the
  years ended 31 December 2X17, 2X18, and 2X19, were 29, 31, and 36 million,
  respectively. Active customer account refers to a unique email address and at
  least one purchase in the indicated period; we do not charge membership fees
  or require minimum purchases to maintain an account.
     Our Fulfillment Network
     To achieve our differentiated customer experience, we focus on urban markets
  and have built a vertically integrated system in which we control every step,
  from a customer’s purchase on our app to the photo confirmation of the delivery
  at the customer’s front door. We receive most of our products directly from
  manufacturers at our fulfillment centers and minimize the use of third-party
  carriers and contractors by directly employing over 65,000 people in fulfillment
  and delivery. We believe direct employment and control of fulfillment assets
  such as delivery trucks enable speed, efficiency, and waste reduction, which is
  especially important for product categories such as fresh foods.
     We’ve made the strategic decision to focus on urban markets in the United
  States for the foreseeable future to achieve an economical route density for
  customer deliveries and returns and one-day shipping.
     Merchant Services
     In 2X13, we launched Merchant Services, allowing third-party merchants to
  sell products on Iliso Marketplace and utilize our fulfillment network. When
  multiple merchants (including us) sell the same product, our algorithm shows
  the customer the lowest price, including shipping cost, though the customer
  can manually choose a different seller. Third-party merchants must meet our
  rigorous quality standards but otherwise have discretion in product assortment
  and description, pricing, and shipping terms.
     We receive sales commissions on third-party merchants’ sales, as well as
  service revenues if the merchant utilizes our fulfillment network for ware-
  housing and delivery. We record revenue on a “net” basis for third-party mer-
  chant-related transactions because we act as an agent; the Company is not the
  seller of record, nor does it take control of the goods inventory. The number
  of active third-party merchants as of the fourth quarter for the years ended 31
  December 2X17, 2X18, and 2X19 was 25,500, 31,500, and 40,500, respectively.
  Active third-party merchant refers to a unique email address and at least one
  sale in the indicated period; we do not charge merchant membership fees, nor
  do we require minimum sales levels.

                              Our annual gross merchandise value (GMV)—which includes the value of

                          sales taxes and returns allowances but including any applicable shipping fees—
                          was $5,721, $6,950, and $8,605 million for the years ended 31 December 2X17,
                          2X18, and 2X19, respectively. GMV by product category for the year ended 31

     The notes to Iliso’s financial statements provide the following descriptions
  of accounts.
     Net retail sales
     Retail sales are earned from the Company’s online product sales to consum-
  ers. Retail revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the
  customer, which occurs upon delivery to the customer.
     Third-party merchant fees
     Third-party merchant fees revenue includes commissions and service fees
  earned from merchants that sell their products through the Company’s online
  business. The revenue is recognized when the order is completed and transmitted
  to the third-party merchant.
     Costs of revenues
     Costs of revenues primarily comprise the purchase price of products sold to
  customers where the Company records revenue gross, and include logistics center
  costs. Inbound shipping and handling costs to receive products from suppliers are
  included in inventory and recognized in costs of revenues as products are sold.
  Additionally, costs of revenues include outbound shipping and logistics-related
  expenses, delivery service costs from our Merchant Services business (where
  the Company is the delivery service provider), and depreciation expense.
     Operating, general, and administrative expenses
     Operating, general, and administrative expenses include costs incurred in
  operating and staffing the Company’s fulfillment centers (including costs attrib-
  utable to receiving, inspecting, picking, packaging, and preparing customer
  orders), customer service costs, payment processing fees, costs related to the
  design, execution, and maintenance of the Company’s technology infrastructure
  and online offerings, and general corporate function costs.
     Advertising and marketing expenses
     Advertising and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include
  brand and performance advertising such as television and digital advertising,
  sponsored search, email marketing campaigns, and other similar initiatives.

  1. What forms the customer base (the “who”) for Iliso’s merchant services
     segment?
      A. Third-party merchants
      B. E-commerce customers
216   Learning Module 5                                                      Company Analysis: Past and Present


                              C. Fresh food and grocery consumers
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. In merchant services, Iliso acts as an agent for third-party
                             merchants. Iliso is paid commissions and service fees by merchants that sell
                             their products through the company’s online business. Third-party mer-
                             chants are therefore the customer base for this business segment.
                             B is incorrect, because e-commerce customers are customers of Iliso’s retail
                             sales segment. Iliso is paid by e-commerce customers for goods purchased
                             through its online platform. The purchases of third-party merchant prod-
                             ucts by these e-commerce customers belong to the third-party merchant
                             and are not recognized in Iliso’s retail sales.
                             C is incorrect, because fresh food and grocery consumers are a product line
                             segmentation of both its retail sales and its third-party merchant GMV. In
                             addition, fresh food and grocery forms only 55% of the overall GMV and
                             does not encompass all of Iliso’s GMV sales.

                          2. Iliso’s business model(s) is(are) likely to benefit from __________ effects.
                             A. network
                             B. value chain
                              C. supply chain
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. Iliso’s business model—in particular, merchant services—is an
                             example of a two-sided network effect. Network effect refers to a network in
                             which the value increases as more participants join the network. By pro-
                             viding an excellent service to merchants and to consumers, Iliso is able to
                             attract both buyers and sellers to its online marketplace. The growth of users
                             on Iliso’s platform attracts more merchants, which in turn attracts more
                             users.
                             B is incorrect, because value chain refers to the systems and processes
                             within a firm that create value for its customers—which answers the “how”
                             aspect of a business model.
                             C is incorrect, because the supply chain is the network inside and outside
                             the company involved in producing the product/service and delivering it to
                             the end user.

                          3. Which of the following business features is least likely to increase consumer
                             retention (“stickiness”) on Iliso’s platform?
                             A. A focus on urban markets
                             B. Next-day or faster delivery
                              C. No membership fee is required.
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. A focus on urban markets does not change customer stickiness.
                             The customer experience for those in urban markets would not necessarily
                             change if the company began shipping to rural markets as well.
                             B is incorrect. The company states that next-day or faster delivery is a hall-
                             mark of its customer experience and may provide a competitive advantage.
                             C is incorrect, because the lack of a membership fee is likely to decrease the
                             cost of a customer’s staying on the platform, thus increasing retention for
                             some customers.

  4. The gross margin of Iliso’s merchant services segment is most likely
     _____________ the gross margin of Iliso’s retail sales segment.
      A. higher than
      B. the same as
      C. lower than
     Solution:
     A is correct. The cost of revenues for Iliso’s retail sales includes the purchase
     price of products sold to customers, including shipping and handling costs,
     whereas the cost of revenues for merchant services includes only the out-
     bound shipping and logistics expenses. The purchase price of products is a
     far higher proportion of total GMV sold to customers compared with ship-
     ping and logistics costs. Accordingly, the exclusion of the purchase price of
     products in both the numerator and the denominator will raise the reported
     gross margin of the merchant services segment.
     B is incorrect, because the gross margin for merchant services cannot be the
     same as that of retail sales. The retail sales segment includes the purchase
     price of products sold and associated inbound logistics costs, which means
     the numerator and the denominator are significantly higher than in the
     merchant services segment.
     C is incorrect, because the gross margin for merchant services cannot be
     lower than that of retail sales. Assuming a positive gross margin for both
     segments, the gross margin for merchant services must be higher since the
     denominator is smaller (being only the service commissions and service fees
     charged to merchants).

Revenue Drivers
After determining the business model, we turn to the analysis of historical finan-
cial results and position for the company. This analysis will be used as a basis for
forecasting a financial statement model that supports security valuation. For most
companies—perhaps with the exception of banks, for which the balance sheet comes
first—analysts start by analyzing revenues. As with other financial statement lines,
the analysis involves identifying drivers, which are causative factors that explain the
level of and changes in an output variable (here, revenues), and understanding the
evolution of the drivers over time.
     Analysts can take a bottom-up or top-down approach to determining revenue
drivers. A bottom-up approach decomposes revenues into drivers such as sales vol-
ume and price, or revenues by product line, segment, or geography, which may be
further broken down into other drivers. A top-down approach expresses revenues as
a function of drivers such as market share, the addressable market or market size,
and GDP growth. The two approaches are often used together.

                                    CASE STUDIES

                                      Bottom-Up Approach to Revenue Analysis:
                                      Warehouse Club Inc.
                                      Warehouse’s revenues are composed of net sales and membership fees.
                                         Based on her business model work, Nguyen knows that net sales are
                                      sales of merchandise and services in Warehouse stores (the company does not
                                      operate an e-commerce business). A logical driver of net sales each year, there-
                                      fore, is the number of stores open that year. Nguyen decomposes Warehouse’s
                                      net sales into two drivers: the average number of stores open and net sales per
                                      average store. Nguyen also calculates the change in these drivers: the absolute
                                      change in stores each year (new-store openings; so far, Warehouse has never
                                      closed a store) and the annual percentage change in net sales per store.

                                      Net sales in 2X19 were 96% higher than in 2X10, driven by similar growth
                                      contributions from the two drivers: the average number of stores increased by
                                      39% and sales per average store increased by 40%.
                                         An encouraging sign for forecasting this company’s results is that each driver
                                      appears relatively stable, indicating that they might be somewhat predictable.
                                      Sometimes, however, key revenue drivers are volatile, such as interest rates
                                      and oil prices for banks and oil producers, respectively. Volatility does not
                                      mean that the analyst has selected an incorrect driver; drivers are based on
                                      the business model.
                                         Nguyen then decomposes Warehouse’s membership fee revenues into the
                                      annual price of membership and the average number of members.
                                                                                                                                   ​

                                      Membership growth has been a larger driver of membership fee revenue growth
                                      than price increases, as the number of members has grown by 70% from 2X10
                                      to 2X19 while prices have increased by 20% over the same period.

        Management indicated that over 90% of members live within 10 kilometers
     of a store and, from 2X10 to 2X19, the company opened 46 new stores. Nguyen
     adds to her membership analysis by calculating the average number of members
     per store; if this number has been falling over time, it could mean that exist-
     ing stores are losing members and sales to new stores the company opens, an
     example of cannibalization.

     Not only has the average number of members per store not declined, but it has
     also grown by 19%, indicating no cannibalization and that new-store openings
     are not the only driver of membership growth. This is a positive sign, though
     Nguyen notes that additional analysis is needed to estimate a ceiling on the
     number of members a store can reasonably support, and to determine whether
     stores that opened many years ago have already hit this ceiling.



Pricing Power
Prices are a driver of revenue for every firm, and it may appear that pricing is a uni-
lateral decision by management (e.g., Warehouse management chooses its markups
on merchandise net sales and has chosen to increase its annual membership fee by
$5 every five years). In fact, prices are constrained by a company’s pricing power.
Pricing power refers to a company’s ability to set prices and other economic terms
with customers without affecting its sales volumes. While Warehouse’s management
could choose to increase the price of membership from $60 to $600, such a decision
would likely result in the loss of all its members. The membership price is constrained
by the savings Warehouse can offer members on purchases, which itself is the subject
of competition from other retailers that also use low prices to attract customers and
of negotiations with suppliers that desire higher prices. Pricing power is primarily a
function of both market structure (covered earlier in Economics) and a company’s
competitive positioning in its market.
     In the most competitive markets, where firms are selling nearly identical products,
firms are price takers—that is, price is dictated by the forces of supply and demand—and
all firms generally sell at the same price. If a firm prices above the prevailing market
price, it will sell a fraction or none of its output, as customers will buy elsewhere. It
is also generally not rational for a firm to price below the market price, as doing so
would not only reduce its profits but also cause competitors to do the same, leading
to a price war. Returns on capital in highly competitive markets move in cycles based
on supply and demand, but over the long run approximate firms’ cost of capital as
competition forces prices down to marginal cost. A low-cost producer (with costs
below—in some cases, well below—those of a marginal producer) can, however,
earn long-run returns above its cost of capital in a highly competitive industry, but it
requires the low-cost position to be sustained against competition over time. A prom-
inent example is state-owned oil producers that benefit from monopoly ownership of
low-cost oil reserves in certain countries.
     Other attributes of highly competitive markets include little to no product differ-
entiation, low barriers to firm entry, available substitutes, a lack of customer loyalty,
and low switching costs for customers. Many markets fit this description, including
retail, oil and gas and other natural resources, bank loans and deposits, insurance,
fresh food, off-patent pharmaceuticals, transportation, and some types of technology

                          hardware. Highly competitive markets often do not start as highly competitive but,
                          rather, become more competitive as new firms enter, the pace of innovation slows,
                          and imitation becomes widespread, a process known as commoditization.
                               Firms operating in less competitive markets, such as monopolistic competition,
                          oligopoly, or monopoly structures, tend to have some degree of pricing power. They
                          can raise prices or change other economic terms (contract length, late fees, etc.)
                          without materially affecting sales volumes. Attributes of these markets include product
                          differentiation, barriers to entry, lack of economical substitutes, switching costs for
                          customers, and a high degree of customer loyalty or retention. Markets and com-
                          panies that fit this description include branded consumer goods, utilities, patented
                          pharmaceuticals, software, restaurants, payment networks, medical devices, and some
                          types of real estate. Firms with pricing power often apply value- or cost-based pricing
                          as well as price discrimination strategies (outlined in the previous module). While
                          product differentiation is most visible, differentiation can also include convenience,
                          wrap-around services, and a secondary resale market.
                               Analysts evaluate pricing power not just by examining a firm’s prices over time or
                          relative to competitors, but also by comparing a firm’s prices with its costs—in other
                          words, its profit margins. While a company may be increasing prices by 3% per year,
                          if its costs are rising by 5%, it is showing both an inability to pass along price increases
                          to customers and declining profitability for investors. A company without pricing
                          power may be unable to increase prices even as costs rise, because it is constrained by
                          the availability of substitutes and customers can easily switch. For example, a movie
                          theater might be unable to increase prices in line with costs, because streaming video
                          subscriptions are cheaper and the company would likely lose customers if it raised prices
                          significantly. Therefore, an important sign of pricing power is rising profitability over
                          time, which demonstrates both an ability to retain economics for investors and that
                          competitors, new entrants, or substitutes are not driving down prices faster than costs.

                             Switzerland. The company sells products with proprietary brand trademarks
                             (such as Nespresso, Purina, Perrier, Maggi, and Stouffer’s) that it acquires and
                             develops with marketing and R&D investments, which totaled CHF19 billion
                             in 2021, or 20% of the company’s revenues. The distinctiveness of its products
                             through branding can confer pricing power. From 2011 to 2021, the company
                             demonstrated its pricing power through a record of increasing prices while
                             increasing volumes and its operating profitability.

Top-Down Revenue Analysis
Analysts can also take a top-down approach to analyzing revenue by expressing it
as a function of drivers such as market size and a company’s share of that market.
This approach will be discussed in more detail in the next module (on industry and
competitive analysis), but we will demonstrate this approach for Warehouse Club Inc.

  Warehouse sells a broad range of retail goods in most cities, so US national
  retail spending is generally representative of Warehouse’s market size—the
  existing demand for goods or services offered by a company. By expressing
  Warehouse’s revenues as a percentage of the market, or its market share, over
  time, we can assess whether the company has been gaining or losing relevance
  with its customers relative to competitors and substitutes.
      A challenge for analysts is determining market size. The data might be difficult
  to gather (not the case here), and judgment is required for determining what
  to include and exclude: only sales of products identical to the company’s, sales
  of similar products, all sales of competitors, and so on. The common practice
  is to include all sales of similar products and to consider substitutes separately
  (discussed in the next module on industry analysis). A substitute serves the same
  function as a product but differs in form (e.g., movie theater and streaming video,
  grocery stores and restaurants, print and digital advertising). This practice is
  subject to a wide range of opinions, however, and some analysts include sales
  of substitutes in market size estimates. The share of market that a firm does not
  have (i.e., 100% – x% market share) represents sales potential.

                           sell automobiles or automobile parts, nor does it sell substitute means of trans-
                           portation or repair. Nguyen considers food service substitutes (restaurants and
                           pubs) for Warehouse.

                               ■    The market is large and growth has been positive, albeit at a slow
                                    (3.4%) rate. This finding aligns with Nguyen’s expectations, because
                                    this is a developed market that represents a broad range of consumer
                                    spending (a large portion of which is for necessities) and the country
                                    has been in an economic expansion.
                               ■    Warehouse Club Inc. has a small (70 basis points in 2X19) but growing
                                    share of the market (up from 48 basis points in 2X10), indicating that
                                    its value proposition relative to other retailers has been resonating
                                    with consumers.
                               ■    Warehouse’s market share increased in most years, with the exception
                                    of 2X16, when its share was flat from the prior year. Nguyen will have
                                    to investigate further.




                          DISCUSSION BOARD QUESTION

                           Which of Nguyen’s analyses was more helpful to you in understanding
                           Warehouse’s historical revenue growth: the bottom-up or the top-down
                           approach? Why?
                              We encourage you to post your response, as well as read and reply to others’
                           responses, on the Learning Ecosystem discussion board.




                          QUESTION SET

                           Questions 1–4 refer to the earlier vignette on Iliso Marketplace Ltd.
Revenue Analysis                                                                          223


  1. In 2X19, the percentage of GMV that Iliso collected from third-party mer-
     chants (the company’s “take rate”) was closest to:
      A. 2.2%.
      B. 14.7%.
      C. 15.0%.
     Solution:
     C is correct. For e-commerce businesses, the take rate refers to the retention
     percentage of the value of transactions facilitated by the platform. In 2X19,
     Iliso third-party merchant fees were $190 million against third-party gross
     merchandise value (GMV) of $1,269 million on its platform. The take rate is
     therefore:
      190/1,269 = 0.1497 ≈ 15.0%
     A is incorrect, because it results from dividing third-party merchant fees by
     total GMV. B is incorrect, because 14.7% is the percentage of Iliso’s GMV
     attributable to third-party merchant sales.

  2. Which of the following measures would be used to best assess Iliso’s pricing
     power?
      A. Take rate
      B. GMV year-on-year growth rate
      C. GMV per active customer account
     Solution:
     A is correct. The percentage of transaction value retained by the platform
     reflects the price Iliso charges third-party merchants to use its platform.
     Both the stability and the level of its take rate reflect the state of competition
     that Iliso faces from other e-commerce platforms.
     B is incorrect, because the GMV year-on-year growth rate can be affected
     by numerous factors, including customer volumes, product mix, and basket
     size. It does not carry information for analysts to estimate pricing power.
     C is incorrect, because GMV per active customer account can be affected by
     product mix and the average basket size, which is driven by its $25 mini-
     mum for free shipping. This measure does not carry information for analysts
     to estimate the pricing power of the platform.

  3. Referring to the data table earlier in this lesson titled “National Retail Sales,
     January 2X19” and assuming 2X19 US monthly retail and food sales of $456
     billion and assuming Iliso’s addressable geography is the United States,
     Iliso’s market share of retail and food sales was closest to:
      A. 0.134%.
      B. 0.138%.
      C. 0.157%.
     Solution:
     C is correct. In 2X19, annual US retail and food sales were: 456 × 12 =
     $5,472 billion. Since GMV reflects the value of retail sales on Iliso’s platform,
     the appropriate estimate of Iliso’s market share is therefore:

                                2X19 GMV/2X19 US retail and food sales = 8,605/5,472,000 = 0.157%
                               A is incorrect, because this measure uses only Iliso’s retail sales and ignores
                               third-party GMV, even though the vignette states that merchants may sell
                               the same products.
                               B is incorrect, because this measure uses Iliso’s net revenues as a percentage
                               of the market. This measure is inappropriate, since Iliso’s net revenues do
                               not reflect the gross value of third-party merchant sales on its platform.

                            4. Which of the following is an appropriate bottom-up driver of Iliso’s
                               revenues?
                                A. Iliso’s market share of US retail and food sales
                                B. GMV per average active customer account
                                C. Iliso’s revenue as a function of GDP growth
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. In a bottom-up approach, analysts decompose the revenues
                               into logical revenue drivers such as product line or segment. A driver of
                               Iliso’s net sales must be the average number of active customer accounts
                               during the period and the net retail sales per account. We use GMV, since
                               this measure accurately reflects the total amount of retail sales (both Iliso’s
                               first-party and third-party sales).
                               A and C are incorrect, because they are top-down, not bottom-up, drivers.

                          ANALYSIS

                                        evaluate a company’s operating profitability and working capital
                                        using key measures



                          Operating Costs and Their Classification
                          Generally, operating costs are incurred in generating—or are otherwise related to—
                          current period revenue: all costs related to the acquisition, production, sale, improve-
                          ment, and delivery of goods and services; the management of business activities; and
                          compliance with laws and regulations. Investing costs are related to the acquisition
                          and production of long-term assets, including tangible assets like property and
                          equipment and intangible assets such as software, trademarks, and patents. Financing
                          costs include payments to debt and equity investors as a return on their investment.

                          MINDING THE GAAP: CLASSIFICATION OF COSTS

                            IFRS and US GAAP do not classify operating, investing, or financing costs in
                            an intuitive manner, and there are differences in classification on the income
                            statement and statement of cash flows. Several prominent examples include:

                                                                        Financing

   Recall that IFRS and US GAAP require the costs of acquiring and constructing
   long-term tangible and intangible assets to be capitalized and then, for those
   with a finite useful life, systematically expensed over time on the income state-
   ment as non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. The most common
   allocation method is straight line, where the cost is expensed evenly over the
   useful life of the asset.
       Unless specified otherwise, we use the IFRS classifications of costs on the
   income statement in our discussion.

    For most companies, operating costs account for the majority of costs and are
primarily determined by the company’s business model and size. As shown in Exhibit
4, a company’s operating costs can be categorized and analyzed in three ways: by their
behavior with output, their nature, or their function.

Behavior with Output: Fixed and Variable Costs
A useful classification of operating costs for analysts is fixed versus variable, which
was introduced in an earlier module. The distinction is useful because the proportion
of fixed to variable costs in operating costs affects the stability and predictability of
operating profit. Using a fixed/variable operating cost classification, operating profit
is defined in Equation 1.
226   Learning Module 5                                                             Company Analysis: Past and Present


                             Operating profit = [Q × (P −VC)] − FC                                                   (1)

                               Q = units of outputs sold in a period.

                               P = price per unit of output.

                             VC = variable operating costs expressed per unit of output. Examples include
                                  merchandise costs for a retailer like Warehouse Club Inc. and materials and
                                  direct labor costs for a manufacturer.

                             FC = fixed operating costs, which do not change within a given range of output in
                                  the short run. Examples include compensation for salaried employees, depre-
                                  ciation and amortization, software and IT expenses, insurance, and certain
                                  utilities costs. FC is stated on a total dollar, not per unit, basis.
                              For a firm to be profitable, it’s clear from Equation 1 that (P − VC), or the con-
                          tribution margin, must be positive and that Q must be high enough such that FC is
                          exceeded. Recall that the amount of fixed costs in the operating cost structure of an
                          issuer is referred to as operating leverage and that it presents both benefits and risks.
                          If operating costs are largely fixed and the contribution margin is positive, operat-
                          ing profit can increase rapidly with increases in Q. However, the reverse is true if Q
                          declines, since fixed costs do not change, so operating profit will fall. As shown in
                          Equation 2, operating leverage can be measured and compared across firms by using
                          the degree of operating leverage (DOL):
                             DOL = % Δ Operating Profit/% Δ Sales                                                    (2)
                          A firm can increase its degree of operating leverage by increasing the fixed costs and

                             Variable and Fixed Cost Analysis
                             While analyzing operating costs using the variable and fixed framework is insight-
                             ful, its use by independent investment analysts is limited because disclosure of
                             fixed and variable costs is not required by IFRS or US GAAP, nor is the disclosure
                             of output volume. Additionally, many companies have several lines of business
                             that have different volume, price, and cost structures, the details of which are
                             lost in the presentation of highly aggregated financial statements that investors
                             receive. However, in some industries, it is common for issuers to disclose these
                             figures, or it is relatively easy for an analyst to make assumptions. A prominent
                             example is oil and gas producers, for which we provide an example here.
                                  Ribbon Energy Ltd. (“Ribbon”) is a fictional oil and natural gas company
                             focused on the exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.

   on an aggregate dollar basis.
       Ribbon’s management provides the following guidance for the next 12 months.
   Management does not provide guidance for prices (and therefore revenue), since
   it sells in a commodity market with volatile prices that are difficult to predict.
   Ribbon does not hedge. At the time guidance was provided, the average oil price
   per barrel was $62.50.

   1. Ribbon’s contribution margin per barrel for the last 12 months is closest to:
      A. $23.2.
      B. $32.4.
       C. $45.3.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Recall that the contribution margin per barrel is P − VC. The
      average price per barrel, P, in the past 12 months was $49.66, and the vari-
      able cost per barrel, VC, was $17.24. Therefore, the contribution margin was
      $49.66 − $17.24 = $32.42.
      A is incorrect, because this amount is the company’s EBIT, or operating
      profit, per barrel.
      C is incorrect, because it results from using the current rather than the last
      12 months’ average oil price per barrel to calculate the contribution margin.

   2. At the high end of management’s guidance, Ribbon’s operating profit for the
      next 12 months is closest to:
      A. $5,496 million.
      B. $5,986 million.
       C. $6,002 million.
      Solution:
      B is correct.
      Operating profit = [Q × (P −VC)] − FC

                             Operating profit = [167.197 million × ($62.50 − $17.34)] − ($1,415 + $150)

                             Operating profit = $5,986 million
                            A is incorrect, because this amount is the operating profit using the low end
                            of guided sales volume of 156.360 million barrels.
                            C is incorrect, because it relies on last year’s production costs of $17.24 per
                            barrel.

                          3. Some analysts covering Ribbon believe that volume will be lower than what
                             management expects. Assuming a 5% reduction over last year’s volume,
                             Ribbon’s operating profit for the next 12 months is closest to:
                             A. $5,077 million.
                             B. $5,091 million.
                             C. $5,776 million.
                            Solution:
                            A is correct.
                            The last 12 months’ volume was 154.812 million. A 5% reduction is 154.812
                            × 0.95 = 147,071 million barrels.
                             Operating profit = [Q × (P − VC)] − FC

                             Operating profit = [147,071 million × ($62.50 − $17.34)] – ($1,415 + $150)

                             Operating profit = $5,076.7 million
                            B is incorrect, because it uses last year’s production costs.
                            C is incorrect, because it assumes a 5% increase rather than decrease in
                            volume from the prior year.

                            Degree of operating leverage: (5,496/1,244 – 1)/(9,773/7,688 – 1) = 1.95

Natural and Functional Operating Cost Classifications and
Measures of Operating Profitability
Rather than fixed and variable, IFRS and US GAAP require issuers to disclose operat-
ing costs using either a natural or a functional cost classification based on “historical
and industry factors and the nature of the entity.” Most issuers, including Warehouse
Club Inc., choose a functional classification. This approach leads to all issuers’ income
statements appearing similar in structure, with lines related to functional areas such
as “cost of sales,” “selling, general, and administrative expenses,” and “research and
development,” even though their business models (and fixed versus variable cost
composition) can differ significantly. The functional classification of operating costs
is used to calculate and distinguish key profitability measures used in analysis and
forecasting, as shown in Exhibit 5.

                                                                    (EBIT)

Gross profit, EBITDA, and EBIT are measures of operating profitability that capture
different functional costs in their definitions. Generally, a significant amount of cost
of sales is variable, so gross margin is an approximate measure of contribution margin.
Other operating expenses such as sales and marketing, general and administrative,
and research and development costs tend to be largely fixed, though they may have
a variable component such as sales commissions. Depreciation and amortization
expenses are fixed unless the issuer uses units of output as the depreciation method.
An issuer’s notes to its financial statements contain useful information about the
composition and nature of operating costs.
    For most companies, the major driver of operating costs over the long run is output,
even for fixed costs, because output growth often requires growth in assets, human
capital, and purchased goods and services. Warehouse Club Inc., for example, might
be able to grow membership fee revenues to an extent without incurring costs, but
growing net sales requires more stores and employees. This has been true even for
so-called asset-light companies in the internet and software industries, which have

                          shown large increases in operating costs along with large increases in revenue over
                          time. Since output or revenue is a major cost driver, analysts often express operating
                          costs as a percentage of revenue. Additional considerations include industry profit-
                          ability, economies of scale, and economies of scope.
                              Industry profitability will be discussed in detail in the next module, but recall from
                          the earlier discussion on pricing power that prices relative to costs (i.e., profitability)
                          are largely dictated by market structure and a company’s competitive positioning.
                          Since industry participants are competing in the same product and factor markets,
                          competitive forces within them determine industry profitability in the long run; ana-
                          lysts should not analyze profitability only on a company-by-company basis.
                              Economies of scale refer to a decline in costs per unit as output grows and generally
                          result from having fixed costs in the cost structure that are spread over more units of
                          output. A company with entirely variable costs can also exhibit some economies of
                          scale over time if it increases its bargaining power over suppliers as it grows, driving
                          down variable costs per unit. Economies of scale are usually evident from the business
                          model and can be found empirically by comparing a company’s size in revenues with
                          its operating costs as percentages of sales or margins.
                              Economies of scope refer to a decline in costs per unit as the number of prod-
                          uct or business lines increases and generally result from shared costs between the
                          product lines. Economies of scope are usually evident from the business model and
                          can be found empirically by comparing the profitability of an integrated company
                          with that of a standalone company. Examples of economies of scope can be found in
                          financial services, where there are customer, client service, compliance, technology,
                          and back-office similarities (and thus cost efficiencies) across commercial banking,
                          consumer banking, brokerage, asset management, payment processing, and invest-
                          ment banking. Economies of scope have resulted in large global firms competing in
                          many lines of business.
                              Recall that Warehouse Club Inc.’s management claimed that it has economies of
                          scale, saying that “low prices for quality products drive greater membership and net
                          sales over time, leveraging our selling, general, and administrative expenses, reducing
                          them as a percentage of net sales.” While this makes intuitive sense as there is prob-
                          ably a fixed amount of SG&A costs each year to operate a store, Elaine Nguyen must
                          corroborate it empirically.

   Based on these drivers, Nguyen calculates Warehouse’s gross margin (1 – cost
   of sales as % of net sales), SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, gross
   fixed assets to depreciation and amortization (implied useful life), store opening
   expenses per new-store opening, and, finally, profit margins. Profit margins
   include membership fee revenues.

         Nguyen makes the following observations:
          ■      Operating costs have increased significantly on an absolute basis from
                 2X10 to 2X19, but on a relative-to-sales basis have remained stable
                 over the same period, indicating that the driver of the increase has
                 been net sales growth.
          ■      One exception is store opening expenses per store opening, which
                 have quadrupled from 2X10 to 2X19, though in aggregate remain a
                 small cost (less than 1/100 of SG&A expenses). Note that these are
                 operating costs related to store openings, such as employee training
                 before opening, not the investing cost of land and fixed assets.
          ■      SG&A expenses do not appear to be fixed relative to net sales, as they
                 have remained roughly the same percentage of net sales over time.

                                ■    Margins have remained mostly stable, though they did increase from
                                     2X15 to 2X17 before coming back down in 2X18 and 2X19. Margins
                                     are low for Warehouse, with EBITDA and operating margins of 4%
                                     and 3%, respectively, in 2X19.
                                ■    The amount of operating profit is similar to the amount of member-
                                     ship fee revenues each year. Nguyen creates the following chart:

                               This chart implies that net sales from its stores—after deducting costs of sales,
                            SG&A expenses, D&A, and store opening expenses—account for the remain-
                            ing 30% of operating profit. This percentage is likely an understatement, since
                            some amount of SG&A expenses is associated with membership fee revenues
                            (marketing, customer service, payment processing, management), but it does
                            align with Warehouse management’s assertion in its annual report that prices
                            provide members with a significant return on membership: the company earns
                            a thin margin on net sales, and it is membership fees that allow the company
                            to run profitably.



                          Working Capital
                          Recall from earlier modules on working capital that the primary measures of a com-
                          pany’s working capital management are activity ratios that determine its cash conver-
                          sion cycle and the ratio of net working capital to sales. A short cash conversion cycle
                          means that the company requires less external financing to fund operations, while net
                          working capital requirements determine a minimum level of investment, in addition
                          to capital investments, that cannot be distributed to investors. Negative net working
                          capital means that suppliers are a source of financing.

      Nguyen makes the following observations:
       ■     The cash conversion cycle is short, less than a week, primarily as a
             result of a DSO of 4, because Warehouse’s customers pay in cash or
             with credit or debit cards that settle in less than five business days, and
             days of inventory on hand is nearly equal to days payable outstanding,
             indicating that inventory is financed by suppliers.
       ■     Net working capital is negative, now down to −5.0% of net sales, indi-
             cating that it is a source of financing for the company.
       ■     Generally, all the activity ratios have been stable since 2X10, except
             for a one-year increase in 2X16 from a decline in days payable out-
             standing. Nguyen looked into this increase in the notes to the financial
             statements in a historical annual report. The company indicated that
             it changed accounting information systems in early 2X17 and made
             accelerated payments to suppliers at the end of 2X16, in advance of the
             system change in case there were problems.

                           1. Compared with 2X18, Iliso’s operating margin change in 2X19 is closest to:
                              A. 0.07%.
                              B. 0.57%.
                              C. 80.56%.
                             Solution:
                             B is correct. Operating (EBIT) margin is Operating profit/Revenue:
                              2X18: 72/6,186 = 1.163%

                              2X19: 130/7,526 = 1.727%
                             Subtracting 2X18 EBIT margin from 2X19 EBIT margin gives:
                              1.727% − 1.163% = 0.564%
                             A is incorrect, because it is the change in gross profit margin.
                             C is incorrect, because it is the year-over-year change in operating profit.

                           2. What is the most likely explanation for Iliso’s improvement in inventory days
                              on hand from 2X15 to 2X19?
                              A. More customers paying in cash
                              B. Strong growth in net retail sales
Operating Profitability and Working Capital Analysis                                   235


       C. Rising proportion of GMV from third-party merchant sales
      Solution:
      C is correct. With third-party merchant sales, Iliso acts as an agent for the
      third-party merchant and does not take control of inventory. Accordingly, as
      the proportion of third-party merchant sales rises in GMV and Iliso’s reve-
      nues, the portion of revenues associated with inventories falls.
      A is incorrect, because there is no indication that Iliso accepts cash on
      delivery (as is common in China and other geographies). It appears that, like
      other e-commerce platforms, Iliso accepts only online payments.
      B is incorrect, because growth in retail sales is likely to grow accounts re-
      ceivable as well; days sales outstanding should be unaffected.

   3. Which of the following expenses are most likely to vary with output?
      A. depreciation
      B. costs of sales
       C. interest expense
      Solution:
      B is correct. Costs of sales are inventory costs that are recognized when a
      sale is made.
      A is incorrect, because depreciation varies with fixed assets. This expense is
      a fixed cost in the short run. Recall that fixed operating costs do not change
      within a given range of output in the short run.
      C is incorrect, because interest expense is a fixed cost component that arises
      from the company’s capital structure, not its revenues.

   4. Iliso doesn’t disclose gross profit on third-party merchant sales. However,
      an analyst observes that a competing marketplace platform makes 85% gross
      profit margin on third-party merchant sales. Assuming that Iliso’s gross
      profit margin is similar, what proportion of Iliso’s gross profit most likely
      came from third-party merchant sales in 2X19?
      A. 7.6%
      B. 15.0%
       C. 28.1%
      Solution:
      A is correct.
      Gross profit of third-party merchant sales = 85% × 190 = $162

      Gross profit of Iliso = Total revenues − Costs of revenues = $7,526 − $5,414
      = $2,112

      Proportion of gross profit arising from merchant sales = $162/$2,112 = 7.6%
      B is incorrect; it is the cost of revenues on third-party merchant sales.
      C is incorrect; it is Iliso’s gross profit margin in 2X19.

                                          evaluate a company’s capital investments and capital structure



                          Sources and Uses of Capital
                          Firms invest capital from debt and equity investors to earn returns above their inves-
                          tors’ required rates of return. An important consideration in company analysis is to
                          evaluate whether required rates of return have been met or exceeded (i.e., whether
                          economic value is created for investors) over the longer run and to assess risks and
                          opportunities associated with the capital structure, such as the use of financial leverage.
                          Before evaluation, a first step is to determine a company’s sources and uses of capital
                          on a historical basis, as shown generically in Exhibit 6.

      Nguyen makes the following observations:
       ■   Capital expenditures and returns to shareholders (dividends and share
           repurchases) are almost equal, which is surprising considering that
           new-store openings performed well; Nguyen expected the company to
           devote a greater amount to capital expenditures for new stores.
       ■   The company has made no acquisitions.
       ■   Even after returns to shareholders, the company seems to prefer equity
           financing to debt financing. This preference is logical considering the
           company’s thin operating margin, though the fact that it primarily sells
           a wide range of necessities reduces its sales risks (i.e., from changes in
           the business cycle and in technology or fashion) and membership fees
           are a source of predictable income.
       ■   The fact that debt issuance is smaller than the increase in cash and
           investments on the balance sheet indicates that the company’s net debt
           has decreased over time, implying a decline in financial leverage.



Evaluating Capital Investments and Capital Structure
Returns on invested capital over the longer run, compared with investors’ required
rates of return, can be used to evaluate whether management has used investors’
capital wisely. Recall that independent investment analysts do not have access to the
same information that management uses to assess individual projects with IRRs and
NPVs, so analysts have to use more aggregated measures to discern whether there
have been worsening or improving trends in value creation.
    Risks related to the capital structure can be measured using leverage and coverage
ratios, credit ratings by third-party rating agencies, and the sensitivity of net income
to changes in operating income known as the degree of financial leverage, as shown
in Equation 3. The degree of financial leverage is increased by higher interest expenses
that are fixed with respect to operating income. The degree of financial leverage is
analogous to the degree of operating leverage but is determined by financing costs
rather than fixed operating costs.

                             Nguyen makes the following observations:
                              ■       The company has created value for investors, with a spread of ROIC
                                      over WACC of 200–700 basis points since 2X10. WACC has declined
                                      slightly over time as interest rates have fallen; this calculation assumes
                                      a constant required rate of return on equity of 9%.
                              ■       The company’s returns on capital are far higher than its low operating
                                      and net margins would suggest, owing to its high asset turnover and
                                      negative net working capital as a low-cost means of financing from
                                      suppliers, requiring less capital from investors.
Capital Investments and Capital Structure                                              239


       ■   The company has a conservative capital structure, with negative net
           debt and a degree of financial leverage close to 1.0 because interest
           expense is largely covered by interest income on cash holdings (i.e.,
           net and operating income move together).
       ■   The capital structure conservatism is evidenced in the counterfactual
           ROIC, which excludes cash and investments on the balance sheet.
           While an exaggeration (the company would need some cash on hand),
           ROIC could be almost 15 percentage points higher if the company
           reduced net cash by investing in value-creating projects or by return-
           ing capital.

    Unlevered returns, as measured by ROIC or return on assets, are augmented by
financial leverage to produce levered returns, or return on equity, which was intro-
duced in an earlier module. We can use return on equity and its decomposition as
a comprehensive measure of profitability for an issuer. The ROE decomposition for
Warehouse Club Inc. illustrates the drivers of the company’s levered returns, which
are well in excess of its net margin.

QUESTION SET

   Questions 1–4 relate to Iliso’s financial statements in the lesson
   “Determining the Business Model”.

   1. In 2X19, the market value of Iliso’s equity was $1,178 million, and the book
      value of debt, which was approximately equal to the market value, was $144
      million. Assuming a cost of debt of 5.5%, cost of equity of 12%, tax rate of
      24%, and price-to-book ratio of 1.0, Iliso’s WACC is closest to:
      A. 11.15%.
      B. 11.30%.
       C. 12.00%.
      Solution:
      A is correct. Recall that:
240   Learning Module 5                                                        Company Analysis: Past and Present


                             WACC = [weighting of debt × gross cost of debt × (1 − tax rate)] + (weighting
                             of equity × cost of equity).
                             Total capital is $1,178 + $144 = $1,322 million. Weighting of debt is there-
                             fore $144/$1,322 = 10.89%, and Weighting of equity is 1 − Weight of debt =
                             89.11%.
                             Therefore, WACC = [10.89% × 5.5% × (1 − 24%)] + (89.11% × 12%) = 11.15%.
                             B is incorrect, because it incorrectly calculates WACC using a pre-tax rather
                             than after-tax cost of debt.
                             C is incorrect; it is the cost of equity.

                          2. Why might Iliso’s WACC be significantly higher than Warehouse Club’s
                             WACC, as calculated earlier in the module?
                             A. Warehouse Club’s business model is less risky than e-commerce.
                             B. Warehouse Club’s capital structure, with degree of financial leverage
                                close to 1.0, is less conservative than Iliso’s.
                              C. Iliso is an established retailer with an investment-grade rating.
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. The cost of equity is the compensation that equity investors
                             demand for the business and financial risks of investing in an issuer’s equity
                             securities. Iliso’s cost of equity is 12%, whereas Warehouse Club’s is 9%,
                             reflecting Warehouse Club’s longer operating history, more proven business
                             model, and competitive positioning.
                             B is incorrect, because Warehouse Club’s capital structure, with degree
                             of financial leverage of 1.0, would imply almost 100% weighting of equity,
                             whereas Iliso has an 11% debt weighting and therefore Warehouse’s capital
                             structure is more conservative.
                             C is incorrect, because an investment-grade rating would reduce Iliso’s cost
                             of debt and WACC.

                          3. Iliso’s degree of financial leverage in 2X19 is closest to:
                             A. 0.77.
                             B. 1.13.
                              C. 1.84.
                             Solution:
                             B is correct, calculated as Change in net income/Change in operating in-
                             come = (100/52 − 1) divided by (130/72 − 1) = 1.146.
                             A is incorrect, because it is incorrectly calculated as 2X19 Net income/Op-
                             erating income = 100/130 = 0.77.
                             C is incorrect, because it is Iliso’s equity multiplier: Total assets/Equity =
                             2,168/(592 + 586) = 1.84.

                          4. Explain why Iliso’s ROE differs from Warehouse Club’s ROE.
                             Solution:
                             Iliso’s ROE is lower than Warehouse Club’s ROE.
                             ROE = Net margin × Asset turnover × Equity multiplier
Capital Investments and Capital Structure                                             241


      ROE = 1.3% × 3.5 × 1.84
      = 8.37%, which is less than half of Warehouse Club’s 18% ROE.
      This primarily results from Iliso’s lower net margin (1% versus 2%) and an
      equity multiplier that is 40% lower (1.84 versus 3), which is somewhat offset
      by Iliso’s higher asset turnover (3.5 versus 3).

                          The following information relates to questions
                          1-7
                             Joshua Hu, a research analyst, is initiating coverage on several companies in the
                             ocean freight shipping industry. OldShips is a mature company with high fixed
                             costs and a high capital expenditure to sales ratio because it owns and operates
                             its own fleet of ships. CleanYards is a technologically advanced, sustainable ship-
                             yard with a focus on specialized repairs and ship construction. Hu has compiled
                             the following data for the two companies:

                                                                          OldShips               CleanYards

                             NewShips, a third company, is a web-based shipping technology platform that
                             connects ship operators such as OldShips with customers in a wide variety of
                             industries who need ocean freight shipping. NewShips’ customers place orders
                             online and pay for freight to be placed on a container to any destination in the
                             world. NewShips’ partners, like OldShips, provide vessels on both long- and
                             short-term charters.
                             In 2X19, NewShips’ platform brokered orders for 900,000 twenty-foot equiv-
                             alent unit (TEU) containers in aggregate, with an average gross freight rate of
                             USD3,848 per TEU. On average, NewShips’ commission, which it receives as a
                             broker from the customer, was 6% of the freight rate.

                          1. Which of the following is most likely to be an element of Hu’s subsequent
                             reports?
                             A. Industry size, growth rate, and key drivers

                             B. Summary of changes to the recommendation

                             C. Ownership structure and management composition

                            SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. A subsequent company research report focuses on updating
                             investors on new information or changes in an analyst’s price target and
                             recommendation.
                             A and C are incorrect, because in-depth information regarding industry size,
                             growth rate, and key drivers or ownership structure and management composi-
                             tion is more suited to an initiation report.

                          2. B is correct. Only NewShips has a capital-light business model. Both OldShips
                             and CleanYards require substantial capital investment in order to increase supply
                             capacity. New ship construction (for OldShips) and acquiring new yards (for
                             CleanYards) take time and cannot be met immediately.

                          3. A is correct. NewShips acts as a broker and earns 5% of the freight rate in com-
                             missions. In 2X19, NewShips brokered 900,000 TEUs at an average freight rate of
                             3,848 per TEU, earning a 5% commission: 900,000 × 3,848 × 0.05 = $173 million.

                          4. B is correct; ROE = DTL × Asset turnover × Equity multiplier.
                             OldShips has half the degree of CleanYards’ total leverage. However, its asset
                             turnover is double CleanYards’ (0.84× versus 0.42×). Since the equity multiplier is
                             the same, their ROEs must be similar.
                             Degree of total leverage (DTL) = DFL × DOL = (% Δ Net income/% Δ Operating
                             income) × (% Δ Operating income/% Δ Q).
                             Thus, OldShips’ DTL = 2 × 1 = 2, whereas CleanYards’ DTL = 2 × 2 = 4.
                             A and C are incorrect, because both companies must have similar ROEs.

                          5. B is correct. Competing products and substitutes are analyzed in Porter’s Five
                             Forces. This analysis is usually performed to better understand a company’s
                             industry and its competitive positioning. Management comments are unlikely to
                             guide the analyst to better understand the company’s business model.
                             A and C are incorrect, because both are relevant sources for an analyst in deter-
                             mining the company’s business model.

                          6. A is correct.
                             CCC = DOH + DSO – DPO, so:
                             OldShips’ CCC = 12 + 27 − 55 = −16 days

                             CleanYards’ CCC = 46 + 98 − 40 = 104 days
                             OldShips, in fact, has a negative cash conversion cycle. OldShips takes advantage
                             of the favorable credit terms granted by its suppliers.
                             B and C are incorrect, because OldShips’ CCC is lower than CleanYards’.

                          7. C is correct. Before a review of a company’s capital investments, the first step is
                             to determine the company’s sources and uses of capital on a historical basis.
                             A and B are incorrect, because both take place after the analyst has identified the
                             company’s sources and uses of cash and determined what to focus on.

INTRODUCTION
It is essential for analysts to understand the industry context for a company’s financial
                                                                                            1
performance and its evaluation. For example, is a company’s revenue growth driven
by a macroeconomic or industry-wide factor (such as an economic expansion) or a
company-specific factor (such as increasing market share)? The answer has important
implications for forecasting and valuation.
     In this learning module, we discuss how an industry is defined and address the
challenges associated with grouping companies that operate in multiple industries.
Next, we introduce methods to survey an industry in terms of size, profitability, and
market share trends. Further analysis includes frameworks to interpret a competitive
environment using Porter’s Five Forces and external trends using PESTLE analysis.
Finally, we combine these approaches to understand a company’s competitive strategy
and its position relative to its industry peers.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Analysts use industry and competitive analysis to understand
           an industry’s structural factors, relative competitive strengths
           and weaknesses, and their contribution to a company’s economic
           profits.
246   Learning Module 6                                                         Industry and Competitive Analysis


                               ■   An analyst’s first step in an industry and competitive analysis is to
                                   define the boundaries of the industry in question and its constituents.
                                   Industries are commonly defined as companies that sell similar prod-
                                   ucts or services. However, this definition can be challenging to apply
                                   in practice, as companies can sell diverse products or services across
                                   many industries and product similarity is subjective.
                               ■   To define an industry, analysts can use third-party classification
                                   systems such as GICS but need to be aware of the methodologies and
                                   limitations of these systems.
                               ■   After defining the industry, the analyst surveys the industry by esti-
                                   mating its total annual sales, historical growth rate, and profitability
                                   metrics and then determining market shares and trends of key players.
                               ■   Industry metrics can be compared against broader economic trends
                                   during recessions or expansions to determine the industry’s level of
                                   maturity, sensitivity to business cycles, and competitive rivalry.
                               ■   Analysts use Porter’s Five Forces to understand an industry’s structure,
                                   as defined by the level of competitive rivalry, through an assessment of
                                   the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitutes, customer bargain-
                                   ing power, and the bargaining power of suppliers.
                               ■   To supplement this research, analysts use PESTLE analysis to under-
                                   stand the external influences on and potential changes to an industry’s
                                   growth rate and market share dynamics.
                               ■   To evaluate a company’s competitive strategy, an analyst should deter-
                                   mine whether the strategy creates a defense against industry forces
                                   and is aligned with the external forces acting on the industry, and
                                   whether the company has the resources and capabilities necessary to
                                   execute it.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. When assigning a company to an industry, which of the following is a limita-
                              tion of using third-party industry classification schemes?
                              A. Currency differences
                              B. Single-product companies
                               C. Strictly hierarchical taxonomies
                              Solution:
                              C is correct. Commercial classification schemes such as GICS, IBC, and
                              TRBC are examples of strictly hierarchical taxonomies that classify a com-
                              pany to a single group, regardless of whether the company sells multiple
                              types of products or services.

                           2. A factor that determines sensitivity to the business cycle is most likely:
                              A. customer migration to substitute products.
                              B. interest rate exposure of the business model.
Introduction                                                                           247


      C. growth rates in line with broader economic activity.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Factors that determine sensitivity to the business cycle include
     the degree to which sales are discretionary or necessary for consumers,
     pricing power, the interest rate exposure of the business model, and whether
     the product is a durable or capital good versus a recurring purchase such as
     consumables and subscription services.
     A and C are incorrect, as they reflect features of a mature industry but are
     not necessarily more cyclical.

  3. A common measure of industry concentration is:
      A. Porter’s Five Forces.
      B. the PESTLE framework.
      C. the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a common measure
     of industry concentration that is calculated as the sum of the squares of
     competitor market shares. Porter’s Five Forces model evaluates an industry’s
     level of competitive rivalry and profitability. The PESTLE framework is more
     concerned with an industry’s growth rate and market share dynamics.

  4. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

     Some of the forces included in Porter’s Five Forces framework are the threat
     of new entrants, sensitivity to the business cycle, and the bargaining power
     of customers.
     Solution:
     False. Porter’s Five Forces model uses the threat of substitutes, the threat of
     new entrants, the bargaining power of customers, and the bargaining power
     of suppliers to determine the rivalry among existing competitors. Sensitivity
     to the business cycle is not one of the forces.

  5. The price competition historically demonstrated by automakers and aircraft
     manufacturers is best described as an example of:
      A. the threat of substitutes.
      B. the bargaining power of suppliers.
      C. the rivalry among existing competitors.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Despite relatively low risks from the other Five Forces, au-
     tomakers and aircraft manufacturers compete fiercely on price, offering
     promotions and generous financing and warranty terms in an attempt to
     capture every sale.

  6. Standardization of a product will ____________ (increase/decrease/have no
     effect on) the bargaining power of customers.
     Solution:
     Standardization of a product will increase the bargaining power of custom-
     ers. For example, oil refiners pay for crude oil based on its grade, not on its
     specific oil producer; crude oil within a grade is interchangeable.

                            7. Impression Ltd. is a fictional company that designs, manufactures, and
                               sells skin care and beauty products. A PESTLE analysis for Impression Ltd.
                               would most likely identify which of the following?
                                A. A customer of Impression Ltd., a large e-commerce retailer, is acquir-
                                   ing a private-label manufacturer of skin care products.
                                B. Increased discussion by legislatures around instituting an excise tax on
                                   disposable plastic packaging as part of a package of carbon taxes
                                C. An online, direct sales competitor has launched a suite of photo filters
                                   that integrate with leading social media apps based on its beauty
                                   products.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. PESTLE analysis is concerned with identifying and evaluat-
                               ing external forces on an industry, which include political forces such as a
                               packaging tax. A and C are incorrect, as they are competitor moves within
                               the beauty industry.

                            8. As a venture capital investor, you are on the board of Ridge Inc., a fictional
                               company that is entering the auto industry, which is characterized by high
                               capital intensity, minimal switching costs for customers because regulations
                               require standardization of many features, and price consciousness of cus-
                               tomers except among a relatively small percentage of affluent consumers.

                               Based on these observations, recommend and justify a competitive strategy
                               to the rest of Ridge Inc.’s board.
                               Solution:
                               A cost leadership strategy is one competitive strategy that might be suc-
                               cessful for Ridge Inc. Since most customers are price conscious and face
                               minimal switching costs between automakers or models, a low selling price
                               can be an effective way to gain market share. Combined with high capital in-
                               tensity, such a strategy might enable Ridge to operate at an economic profit
                               if it produces and sells enough volume and maintains fixed-cost discipline
                               to keep unit costs low. Other competitive strategies that might be successful
                               for Ridge include a differentiation strategy aimed at luxury or performance
                               customers.

Why Analyze an Industry?
Many industry participants have similar business models. They often compete in the
same or similar product markets as sellers and in factor markets as buyers, so they
tend to be exposed to the same demand and supply opportunities and risk factors. As
will be discussed later with Porter’s Five Forces model, these industry structural factors
result in profitability differences by industry in the long run, with company-specific
factors like business model variation, competitive strategy, size, and execution creating
variance around the industry median.
    McGahan and Porter (1997) estimated the relative importance of industry versus
company-specific effects on both the emergence of economic profits (ROIC in excess
of WACC) and their sustainability over time, finding that industry was the most
important factor in the sustainability of economic profits. Importantly, they found
that company-specific effects were much larger for low performers than for high
performers in an industry, suggesting that industry and competitive forces can act as
a ceiling on a company’s returns but not as a floor.
    A useful way to think about this dynamic is that competition “pulls” company
profitability to an industry base rate over time. Industry and competitive analysis is
used to estimate that base rate and its determinants, to form a forward-looking per-
spective on potential structural changes, and, finally, to analyze firms’ relative strengths
and weaknesses to determine their position against the base rate. It is important to
emphasize, though, that these measures and outcomes are dynamic and that some
companies have outperformed or underperformed their industry in economic prof-
itability for many years.


Improve Forecasts
Competitive forces from industry incumbents, substitutes, suppliers, and customers
discipline companies’ prices and costs, market share, and thus profitability. By taking
an industry perspective and better understanding these drivers—as well as building a
database of past competitive actions and strategies by firms in an industry and their
track records of success—analysts can sharpen their forecasts and alertness to what
is most important. Guan, Wong, and Zhang (2014) found that sell-side investment
analysts who covered both companies and their suppliers made more accurate earnings
250   Learning Module 6                                                                   Industry and Competitive Analysis


                          forecasts than those who did not cover the suppliers. Without a broader perspective,
                          an analyst may underrate competitive forces and overrate the degree to which a
                          company controls its destiny.


                          Identify Investment Opportunities
                          Industry analysis may uncover an attractive investment candidate that an analyst was
                          previously unaware of or had not fully appreciated until assessing its strengths and
                          weaknesses relative to industry peers and competitors. In addition, some investors may
                          conclude that it is the industry, not any specific company, that they want exposure to,
                          and in fact would like to diversify away the company-specific risks. These investors
                          might take a basket approach by investing in several companies with position sizes

                          We approach industry and competitive analysis through the process shown in Exhibit
                          2, which begins with defining an industry and ends with evaluating a company’s com-
                          petitive positioning in the context of that industry.

                            1. Over the long run:
                                A. business cycles result in profitability differences by industry.
Industry Classification                                                                         251


       B. company-specific factors such as competitive strategy result in profit-
          ability differences by industry.
       C. structural factors result in profitability differences by industry.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Structural factors, such as Porter’s Five Forces, drive profitabili-
      ty and profitability differences by industry in the long run. Company-specif-
      ic factors result in company profitability levels around the industry median,
      while changes in the business cycle drive short-run profitability for both
      industries and companies.

   2. Which of the following is an industry, not a company-specific, attribute?
       A. Competitive strategy
       B. Business model variation
       C. Sensitivity to the business cycle
      Solution:
      C is correct. Sensitivity to the business cycle is an example of a factor that
      influences an entire industry.
      A and B are examples of company-specific attributes, which also include
      company size and strategy execution.

   3. Explain why industry has a significant effect on company growth and
      profitability.
      Solution:
      Companies in the same industry compete in similar product markets as
      sellers and in factor markets as buyers, so they tend to be exposed to the
      same demand and supply opportunities and risk factors. For example,
      while a restaurant company that sells chicken has a different product than
      a restaurant that sells pastries, both are competing for a similar customer
      need (prepared food), employ similarly skilled workers, and have capital
      equipment and real estate.




INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION
                                                                                            3
               describe industry classification methods and compare methods by
               which companies can be grouped

An industry is commonly defined as companies that sell similar products or services,
from the perspective of a customer. Challenges in defining an industry include whether
to include substitutes, classifying companies that operate in multiple industries, geo-
graphical considerations, and making updates since business models are always evolv-
ing. To help analysts contend with these difficulties, third-party organizations maintain
industry classification schemes that are widely used in investment management.

                          Third-Party Industry Classification Schemes
                          Early third-party industry classification schemes such as SIC, NACE, and ISIC
                          were devised by government agencies, tended to be country-specific, and grouped
                          companies by their production characteristics into industries such as agriculture,
                          manufacturing, distribution, retail, and services. The schemes were not updated fre-
                          quently and became less useful as new technologies and business models emerged
                          and both issuers and investors became increasingly global. These legacy schemes used
                          by investment analysts were largely replaced with commercial schemes such as the
                          Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) by MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices,
                          Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) by FTSE Russell, and The Refinitiv Business
                          Classification (TRBC) by Refinitiv. These schemes are global, reviewed and updated at
                          least annually, with new companies added more frequently, and group companies by
                          the similarity of the products or services they sell—a “demand” approach rather than
                          the “supply” approach of the legacy schemes. GICS and ICB cover public companies,
                          while TRBC also covers private companies, non-profits, and government entities. Data
                          aggregators (such as Bloomberg, FactSet, and CapIQ) and stock exchange operators
                          (such as the London Stock Exchange) either use these industry classification schemes
                          or have their own that are substantially similar.
                              GICS, ICB, and TRBC are strictly hierarchical taxonomies, analogous to the species,
                          genus, family, etc., taxonomy used in biology. In each scheme, a company is classified
                          to a single group in the lowest tier, with the groups themselves making up the higher
                          tiers. In other words, continuing with the biology metaphor, a company is classified
                          to a single species, which automatically assigns it to a genus, family, and so on. GICS,
                          ICB, and TRBC have slightly different groupings, tiers, and names. Exhibit 3 shows
                          the names and hierarchy of each scheme’s tiers, the number of groups in each tier,
                          and the composition of the highest tier.

GICS, ICB, and TRBC also have slightly different rules for companies operating in
multiple industries, all of which use some discretion. While each scheme differs slightly,
the general process is shown in Exhibit 4. The goal is to assign a company to a single
grouping that describes the majority of its business.

                          Limitations of Third-Party Industry Classification Schemes
                          While these classification schemes are a useful starting place for research (and they
                          have other uses like index construction and investment performance attribution,
                          described elsewhere in the curriculum), they have four important limitations that
                          analysts must contend with in doing industry research:
                             1. Groupings of companies with business model variations or that sell substi-
                                tute products
                             2. The classification of multi-product companies
                             3. Geographical considerations
                             4. Changes in groupings over time that affect prior-period comparability of
                                industry statistics
                              Analysts may find that industry groupings in the third-party schemes are either too
                          narrow or too broad, as the scheme providers use discretion in constructing groups
                          based on product similarity and business model. Therefore, analysts must either use
                          classification tiers at a higher or lower level or modify the groupings based on their
                          own discretion and purposes of analysis. On the one hand, many companies classified
                          as “application software” sell products with completely different functionality and do
                          not compete with one another—for example, Shopify, the Canadian company that
                          sells front-end and payment processing software to small and mid-sized e-commerce
                          companies, is grouped with Check Point Software, an Israeli security software com-
                          pany. On the other hand, as will be shown with Warehouse Club Inc., retailers are
                          classified into numerous sub-industries and even across sectors, although many of
                          their product offerings overlap and are thus competing for the same consumer dollar.
                              Because GICS, ICB, and TRBC are strict taxonomies, multi-product companies
                          are assigned to a single grouping. This treatment can be a problem for an analyst
                          identifying competitors if a competitor is a division of a company classified in a
Industry Classification                                                                      255


different industry or even sector. The most prominent examples are in technology. A
large software market is cloud infrastructure and platform services (sometimes called
“public cloud”), which are computing, storage, and other IT-related capabilities sold
on a metered basis to clients over the internet. Large players include Amazon Web
Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Alibaba Cloud, which are
all divisions of larger parent companies with other segments that differ materially
by business model. While Amazon and Alibaba are classified in the same industry,
Alphabet (parent of Google Cloud Platform) and Microsoft are each classified in dif-
ferent sectors. Amazon’s classification as a consumer discretionary retailer has long
inspired consternation, as most of its operating profits come from its Amazon Web
Services segment, not e-commerce.
    With their global nature, GICS, ICB, and TRBC are useful for some sectors and
industries that are in fact global (primarily those that manufacture physical goods and
digital products), but they can be less useful for more service-oriented companies that
compete nationally or even locally because of customer behavior or regulations that
restrict competition. For example, only a small minority of people travel a significant
distance from their home to receive healthcare services, and insurers (whether private
or government) typically restrict the choice of provider geographically. Governments
also regulate the practice of medicine through the licensing of facilities, physicians,
and other practitioners. Therefore, the healthcare services industry is best examined
on a national or regional basis; the economics of hospitals in the UAE have little rel-
evance to those in France. However, this approach should not be taken for granted,
as industries can globalize or localize based on business model changes. While media
(pay TV) companies were once regional, the shift to internet-based streaming video
has resulted in a global industry with new, larger players.
    Finally, industry classification scheme providers change groupings and classifica-
tions, which can affect industry statistics. One of the largest changes, for example, was
the creation of the Real Estate sector, composed primarily of Real Estate Investment
Trusts carved out of the Financials sector. Additionally, public offerings and de-listings
from acquisitions and bankruptcies change the composition of the groupings over
time (introducing survivorship bias in historical returns statistics). Analysts should
be aware of these issues, make sure that historical statistics are restated to conform
to the latest groupings, and construct survivorship bias–free datasets if possible.

                            While this classification is logical, the sub-industry includes companies outside
                            Warehouse’s domestic geography that are less relevant to its customers and
                            does not include many companies in its domestic geography that sell similar
                            products to the same types of customers. For example, grocers and drugstores
                            are included in a different sub-industry (Food Retail and Drug Retail, respec-
                            tively), and e-commerce retailers that it competes with are in a different sector
                            entirely (Consumer Discretionary).
                                The challenge in placing Warehouse in an industry is that it sells several
                            categories of consumer goods, both staples and discretionary goods like apparel,
                            as do many other companies. Retailers also have varying business models—
                            including membership-based warehouses, e-commerce, and co-locations with
                            other services like pharmacies—and have varying location, assortment, and
                            pricing strategies.
                                Elaine Nguyen chooses to define Warehouse’s industry more broadly than
                            its GICS sub-industry by taking a customer perspective: retailers of all kinds
                            operating in Warehouse’s domestic geography, except for automobile and auto
                            parts retailers as Warehouse does not sell those products or even substitutes
                            for them (and it is a large category of domestic retail sales). Nguyen also does
                            not include restaurants and food services, instead considering them substitutes.



                          Alternative Methods of Grouping Companies
                          An industry or product approach to grouping companies is not the only grouping
                          method and may be less useful in contexts outside industry analysis. Other approaches
                          that are used in contexts such as index construction and investment performance
                          evaluation include the following:
                             ■   Geography, in which companies are classified by country and then coun-
                                 tries are aggregated into categories such as developed, emerging, and
                                 frontier markets. Classification by country is typically by the country where
                                 the issuer is incorporated, the country of the primary listing of its equity
                                 securities, the location of its headquarters, or market perception. Note that
                                 classification by the geographic composition of revenue is generally not the
                                 approach taken, though this aspect may be the foremost concern for an
                                 analyst. For example, Toyota is universally classified as a Japanese company.
                                 However, its largest market by revenues is North America, which is also the
                                 location of most of its assets. The classification of developed, emerging, and
                                 frontier markets is more controversial, and third parties like index providers
                                 use greater discretion. It is not a quantitative determination but considers
                                 variables such as the size and liquidity of equity securities markets in the
                                 country, income per capita, and legal restrictions on foreign investment.
                             ■   Sensitivity to the business cycle, with groupings such as “defensive” and
                                 “cyclical.” Defensive companies are those whose sales growth, profitabil-
                                 ity, and valuations are less affected by changes in broad macroeconomic
                                 activity (e.g., GDP growth), while the opposite is true of cyclicals. Generally,
                                 this classification is done by grouping entire sectors from the industry
                                 classification schemes discussed earlier. Sectors such as consumer staples,
                                 healthcare, and utilities are considered defensive, while financials, basic
                                 materials, consumer discretionary, and industrials are considered cyclical.
                                 This grouping method can be combined with other methods—such as a
                                 geographic approach (e.g., Japanese cyclicals), because countries may vary
                                 with respect to their current position in the business cycle, or credit ratings
                                 (e.g., Japanese cyclicals with high-yield credit)—to further isolate exposure
                                 to certain risk factors.
Industry Classification                                                                    257


    ■    Statistical similarities, or the use of clustering analysis to group companies
         based on similarities of financial ratios and market data or co-movements of
         their securities’ investment returns. This approach includes grouping by size
         according to market capitalization or by other characteristics such as the
         following:

         ●   Valuation ratios
         ●   Growth rates of sales or earnings
         ●   Profitability ratios
         ●   Statistics based on price performance such as volatility and momentum
    ■    ESG characteristics, such as the ratio of carbon emissions to revenues, mea-
         sures of board and executive personnel diversity, and exposure to certain
         businesses such as tobacco and gambling. These metrics can be aggregated
         into composite ESG ratings or scores that enable cross-issuer comparability.
   These groupings are usually relative (e.g., companies with dividend yields at or
above the 75th percentile as of the measurement date) and tend to show far more
turnover in their constituents than groupings based on industries and countries,
because these statistics are less stable by company and companies’ rankings change.

QUESTION SET


   1. Contrast the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) com-
      mercial scheme with the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) third-party
      classification system in terms of geographic coverage, update frequency, and
      the addition of new companies.
        Solution:
        The GICS commercial scheme is determined on a global basis, updated at
        least annually, and adds new companies frequently, while the SIC is US-only,
        infrequently updated, and does not regularly add new companies.

   2. The GICS, ICB, and TRBC commercial industry classification schemes suf-
      fer from which common problem when used by analysts?
        A. They quickly become out of date.
        B. They cover a limited number of countries.
         C. They often classify multi-industry companies inaccurately.
        Solution:
        C is correct. Commercial industry classification schemes are strictly
        hierarchical and assign each company to a single industry. Multi-industry
        companies are classified using evaluations of segment revenues, profits, or
        assets or the discretion of the scheme creator. This approach often results
        in classifications that are different from analyst expectations or in “multi-in-
        dustry” classifications that are challenging to use in practice.

   3. Identify whether each of the following sectors is generally considered “cycli-
      cal” or “defensive.”

                                         market share trends

                          After defining an industry, the next step in industry and competitive analysis is to sur-
                          vey the industry by estimating its size, calculating its historical growth rate, evaluating
                          the character of that growth rate, measuring its profitability, and identifying major
                          industry players and market share trends over time. This industry survey provides a
                          basis for the industry evaluation in the next step and makes an analyst aware of the
                          main issues and opportunities.


                          Industry Size and Historical Growth Rate
                          Industry size is typically measured by total annual sales from the product or customer
                          perspective, which is not necessarily all sales of each industry constituent. For example,
                          Amazon’s retail segment sales would be included in sizing the retail industry, while
                          sales for its Amazon Web Services segment would not. The growth rate is calculated
                          either as year-over-year rates each year or as a compounded annual growth rate over a
                          multi-year period. If possible, industry growth should be broken out by contributions
                          from volume and price/mix drivers.
                              Except for some industries that are dominated by large, publicly traded companies
                          (e.g., autos, smartphones, airlines, pharmaceuticals), industry size will often include
                          a potentially large amount in sales from private companies, sometimes small busi-
                          nesses, for which data are unavailable or impractical to tabulate. It’s common practice
                          to estimate industry size for these industries using economic indicators published by
                          government agencies, data from third-party consultancies that use surveys, or indus-
                          try data from issuers’ investor presentations based on proprietary sources. These all
Industry Survey                                                                             259


need to be corroborated for reasonableness by the analyst. For Warehouse Club Inc.,
for example, we use retail sales published by a government agency for industry size,
because the retail industry includes hundreds of thousands of small retailers.


Characterizing Industry Growth
The pattern of historical growth of an industry can be used to characterize it based on
the magnitude of its growth rate and sensitivity to the business cycle. One approach to
characterizing an industry’s growth rate is a style box, as shown in Exhibit 5. Essential
to this approach is comparing the industry’s historical growth rate with a broader
measure of economic growth during recessions and expansions.

Growth industries include those that have not yet reached full saturation or pene-
tration of their total addressable market, and thus have idiosyncratic growth drivers
separate from broader economic growth. Growth industries are often based on or
benefit from an emerging technology. Key questions for analysts related to growth
industries include whether historically high growth rates will persist and what the peak
penetration rate is—which are more challenging to answer the “newer” the industry
is. Conversely, mature industries have fully penetrated their addressable market and
have growth rates either in line with broader economic activity (approximately zero)
or declining as customer demand migrates to a substitute. Key issues for investors in
a mature industry include monitoring for disruptive threats, changes in competitive
intensity, and the speed of decline.
    Sensitivity to the business cycle is driven by the business models of companies in
an industry and correlates with industry maturity. Factors that determine sensitivity
include the degree to which sales are discretionary or necessary for consumers, prices,
the interest rate exposure of the business model, and whether the product is a durable
or capital good versus a recurring purchase such as consumables and subscription
services. Although most investors expect greater variability in returns from firms in
cyclical industries, differing investor views as to the length and magnitude of such
cycles lead to wide variations in the valuations of issuers over time.
    Although commonly used by market participants, these distinctions can some-
times be of limited usefulness. For example, a severe economic downturn is likely to
have a negative impact on all firms, so differences will be a matter of degree but not
categorical. Second, companies in different stages of the life cycle within an industry
can differ materially in terms of growth, defensiveness, and cyclicality; for example,
growth firms based on an emerging technology may exist within a cyclical industry
that is far less affected by an economic downturn.

                          Industry Profitability Measures
                          The best measure of industry profitability is a time series of the distribution of returns
                          on invested capital (e.g., 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles), which captures after-tax oper-
                          ating profits for each dollar of invested capital and is agnostic about capital structure.
                          However, unless the industry is dominated by public companies, obtaining these data
                          is seldom feasible.
                              Two common methods to overcome this challenge in practice are to measure the
                          profitability of the publicly traded players and assume that the profitability of private
                          competitors is similar—either using various sources to estimate the profitability of
                          non-public companies (e.g., for state-owned energy companies, there are estimates
                          of their production costs per barrel, production, and capital expenditures, and prices
                          are generally uniform throughout the industry) or obtaining data from a government
                          agency or third-party consultancy. For Warehouse Club Inc., the same government
                          agency that publishes retail sales data each month also does an annual survey of retail-
                          ers’ gross margins and operating expenses, which can be used to calculate industry
                          operating margins.
                              Clearly, a profitable industry is preferable to an unprofitable one, but often more
                          important than a point estimate of profitability is the time series: is industry profit-
                          ability rising or falling? If there is a discernible trend, it will be an important point of
                          investigation for the analyst.


                          Market Share Trends and Major Players
                          Finally, market shares are measured by expressing industry participants’ annual
                          revenues as percentages of the industry size each year. Given the aforementioned
                          measurement problems with estimating industry size, market shares should be
                          interpreted as a range rather than a definitive point estimate. Again, more important
                          than each company’s market share is the trend over time, which can reveal whether
                          customers have judged the company’s products superior to competitors’. An important
                          consideration is acquisitions, particularly large ones; a company buying a competitor
                          is a market share gain, but more important is whether the company is increasing or
                          decreasing its share on an organic (non-acquired) basis.
                              An additional consideration in this analysis is the degree of industry concentra-
                          tion. Lower concentration—that is, many small competitors in the market—is usually
                          associated with a high degree of competitive intensity unless the industry is very
                          service-oriented, is local in nature, or has high product differentiation. Rising concen-
                          tration (consolidation) is associated with falling competitive intensity and higher prof-
                          itability. A common measure of industry concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman
                          Index (HHI), calculated as the sum of the squares of competitor market shares:
                                          ∞
                             	​HHI = ​∑      ​​s​2​​ ,​
                                          i=1 i

                          where s is the market share of market participant i stated as a whole number (i.e.,
                          50% share = 50, not 0.50).
                              A market consisting of four firms with shares of 30, 30, 20, and 20 has an HHI
                          of 302 + 302 + 202 + 202 = 2,600. The maximum HHI is for a monopoly, with a value
                          of 1002 = 10,000. Antitrust regulators in some countries consider markets with an
                          HHI between 1,500 and 2,500 moderately concentrated and consider markets with
                          an HHI over 2,500 highly concentrated. A rule of thumb is that acquisitions in highly
                          concentrated markets that increase the HHI by more than 200 points are often subject
                          to regulatory challenges.

  Industry Size and Growth Rate

  Elaine Nguyen sizes the US retail (excluding autos) industry using three mea-
  sures: total annual revenues, annual revenues on a per capita basis, and the
  number of retailers. For all these measures, Nguyen uses data from the US
  Census Bureau, since the industry consists mostly of small businesses with
  no public filings and the data are high quality; the Bureau has been collecting
  such data since 1952.

                          Character of Industry Growth

                          The retail industry has existed for hundreds of years in the USA, though there
                          have been many changes in both form (e.g., department stores, discounters,
                          e-commerce) and the products sold. Comparing industry sales growth with GDP
                          growth since the early 1990s shows that the two are tightly related. However,
                          the industry does not show extreme cyclicality, unlike the auto industry.
                             Elaine Nguyen classifies the industry as mature and moderately cyclical.

                          margins of all retailers (except autos) in the USA using Census Bureau data
                          and (2) the profitability of the 10 largest publicly traded retailers in the USA by
                          2X19 sales. Because of segment disclosure changes, M&A, and other corporate
                          transactions, Nguyen examines the last 5 rather than 10 years of data.

     Market Share Trends

     The most significant market share trend in US retail is the shift toward e-com-
     merce, which has been ongoing since the late 1990s. This shift has accrued largely
     to Amazon.com, the pioneer in US e-commerce, with its share of e-commerce
     at roughly 40% (Amazon has a large third-party merchant business but does
     not disclose GMV, so its exact share is unknown).

        The industry is fragmented, with the top 10 largest firms holding less than
     30% market share, the 10th largest holding less than 1%, with a large amount of
     share held by over 500,000 small retail businesses. However, the top 10 largest
     firms have gained share (~2%, from 26.3% in 2X15 to 28.6% in 2X19).

                                    QUESTION SET


                                     1. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

                                        Industry size is typically measured by the total annual sales of all industry
                                        constituents.
                                        Solution:
                                        False. Industry size is typically measured by the total annual sales from the
                                        product or customer perspective, which is not necessarily the sum of total
                                        sales of each industry constituent as some constituents may have segments
                                        in other industries.

                                     2. A section of the fast-food market consists of 10 firms operating 1,840
                                        restaurant locations across North America and currently has a Herfind-
                                        ahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of 1,516. The market leader announces plans to
                                        acquire its closest competitor and commits to not closing any locations at
                                        either company. As a result, the HHI will most likely:
                                         A. decrease.
                                         B. not change.
                                         C. increase.
                                        Solution:
                                        C is correct. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is calculated as the
                                        sum of the squares of competitor market shares. In this example, the market
                                        share of the leading company would increase and the number of competi-
                                        tors would decrease, which would increase the HHI. The number of store
                                        locations does not affect the HHI.

                                     3. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

                                        Companies in different stages of the life cycle within the same industry can
                                        differ materially in terms of cyclicality.
                                        Solution:
                                        True. An industry is defined as companies with similar products or services
                                        from the perspective of a customer. A new entrant in an industry may have
                                        low but increasing market share, which can serve as a growth driver in
                                        addition to an economic expansion. The new entrant may therefore be less
                                        affected than a mature company by a recession.

                                     Please refer to the Industry Survey for Warehouse Club Inc. and Iliso
                                     Marketplace Ltd. earlier in the lesson to answer the following questions.
Industry Structure and External Influences                                                  265


   4. Amazon.com’s change in US retail market share from 2X15 to 2X19 is best
      described as an example of:
      A. a disruptive threat.
      B. achieving peak penetration rate.
       C. saturation of its addressable market.
      Solution:
      A is correct. As the pioneer in US e-commerce, Amazon achieved roughly
      40% market share by using Amazon.com as an online shopping platform.
      Therefore, Amazon.com is an example of a disruptive threat to the estab-
      lished retail industry. Based on US net sales from 2X15 to 2X19, it is un-
      certain whether Amazon achieved its peak penetration rate or saturated its
      addressable market, as it continued to increase its market share component
      of the top 10 retailers’ share from 7% to 14%.

   5. Current economic forecasts call for an increase of 3% in US GDP, an infla-
      tion rate of 1.5%, and decreasing consumer sentiment. Therefore, over the
      next fiscal year, Nguyen would most likely expect Warehouse Club Inc.’s total
      sales to:
      A. decrease.
      B. increase 2%–5%.
       C. increase 5%–8%.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Nguyen classifies the industry as mature and moderately cycli-
      cal, and Warehouse Club Inc. operates a single line of business with no new
      products or services defined. As a result, Warehouse Club Inc.’s total sales
      would move in line with broader US GDP growth as a stable company in a
      mature industry.




INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND EXTERNAL INFLUENCES

              Five Forces and PESTLE frameworks

Recall from earlier lessons in economics that Porter’s Five Forces is a framework
for assessing industry structure that determines an industry’s long-run profitability
measure by its returns on invested capital.

                                                                 customers


                               If some or all of the five industry forces are intense, almost no company earns
                          attractive returns on capital, while benign forces lead to highly profitable industries.
                          From the industry survey work in the previous lesson, we may have already measured
                          the industry’s profitability on a historical basis. The analysis of structural forces is
                          aimed at not simply measuring profitability but rather characterizing its drivers in a
                          qualitative fashion and improving alertness to key issues to monitor that can affect
                          industry profitability. For new industries for which data are unavailable or which are
                          still in an early, unprofitable stage, the analysis of industry structure can help point
                          to potential profitability levels.


                          Assessing the Five Forces: A Checklist Approach
                          The assessment of the five forces is similar to the determination of a company’s business
                          model, from the prior module, in that it is a qualitative research investigation that is
                          difficult to generalize. We provide illustrative questions to answer as an analyst and
                          offer examples of real industry observations for each question.

                             ■   Have there been significant numbers of new industry entrants in recent
                                 history?

                                 ●   In the USA, more than 50,000 new restaurants are opened per year.
                                     Conversely, from 2010 to 2021, fewer than three new commercial bank
                                     charters were issued per year in the USA.
                             ■   Are there network effects with the industry’s product or service, such that
                                 its value to users is greater as the number of users increases and a new
                                 entrant would have a low-value product that has to achieve scale?

                                 ●   Payment networks such as Visa, Mastercard, JCB, and China UnionPay
                                     enable payments between hundreds of millions of cardholders and mil-
                                     lions of merchants by connecting thousands of financial institutions on
                                     their network.
                             ■   Do incumbents benefit from economies of scale from significant fixed
                                 costs in the cost structure, such that a new entrant would require time and
                                 unprofitable economics to reach competitiveness?
Industry Structure and External Influences                                               267


        ●   Cloud computing services require enormous fixed assets in terms of
            servers and networking equipment. These services have virtually no
            variable cost, however, and large incumbents have decreased unit prices
            substantially over time while gaining scale.
    ■   Do incumbents benefit from economies of scope across multiple business
        lines—from increased convenience in terms of customers and market share
        and/or from joint costs that can be leveraged across the businesses?

        ●   Warehouse Club Inc. operates pharmacies and gas stations, which lever-
            ages real estate costs and drives increased foot traffic. Many commercial
            banks operate consumer banks, asset and investment management,
            broker-dealers, and investment bank businesses, as there are common
            customers and joint operating costs.
    ■   Are customers loyal to brands?

        ●   A common threat to branded consumer merchandise sold to retailers is
            merchandise manufactured by contract manufacturers at the direction
            of the retailer and sold under retailer-owned “private label” or “generic”
            brands. In some categories, such as dairy milk and packaged baked
            goods, private label has over 50% volume share, which has risen over
            time. Consumers do not appear to be driven by brands in these catego-
            ries. However, energy drinks, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco products
            have a very low private label market share over time, with consumers
            making repeat purchases of the same brand. Note that an important
            consideration for the value of brands is the legal environment that pro-
            tects trademarks, trade dress, copyright, and other intangible assets in a
            jurisdiction. Without these legal protections, brands and their likeness
            can be imitated by competitors.
    ■   Are there significant switching costs for customers in terms of time, train-
        ing, or replacement?

        ●   So-called infrastructure software such as SAP for businesses requires
            lengthy implementation processes led by third-party consulting firms,
            and connections to other mission-critical software systems need to be
            established. Switching from SAP to another provider is a costly and
            lengthy endeavor. Conversely, customers can and do switch between
            food delivery apps, as minimal useful information is needed (or stored)
            to switch apps (payment information).
    ■   Do incumbents have exclusive or preferential access to hard-to-obtain
        inputs or end-customer interfaces?

        ●   In the beverages business, incumbents have shelf space arrangements
            with retailers, often own distribution assets, and in some countries have
            the same arrangements with restaurants and pubs. This advantage is a
            potent deterrent for the beverage companies’ customers to start carrying
            new entrants’ products.
    ■   Are there government policies that restrict or slow industry entry?

        ●   These policies can take many forms, such as regulations that only larger
            companies can afford to comply with, subsidies for domestic companies,
            patents, and licenses.

                          Note that experience and expertise among incumbents are not sustainable barriers
                          to industry entry. Entrants can imitate, poach employees, purchase inputs and ser-
                          vices from the incumbents’ suppliers, and engage with industry consultants to obtain
                          industry expertise.

                          Assessing the Threat of Substitutes

                             ■   Is there another product or service that fulfills the same or similar customer
                                 need? Is it lower priced?

                                 ●   Video conference calls and collaboration software are a low-price substi-
                                     tute for business travel and office real estate.
                             ■   Can customers go without the industry’s product?

                                 ●   Aesthetic and elective medical procedures can be canceled or deferred
                                     without loss of function for a patient.
                             ■   Is the substitute product improving in performance relative to the industry’s
                                 product?

                                 ●   While digital advertising was rudimentary in the early 2000s, with pop-
                                     ups and display ads, and was not a material threat to television advertis-
                                     ing, digital advertising improved to include highly targeted videos and
                                     advertising disguised as content from third-party influencers and has
                                     taken market share from television advertising.
                             ■   Is it difficult for customers to switch to a substitute?

                                 ●   In most countries, prescriptions for a branded pharmaceutical are
                                     automatically substituted with a generic at a pharmacy if there is one
                                     approved.


                          Assessing the Bargaining Power of Customers

                             ■   Are there few, concentrated customers for the industry?

                                 ●   For many electronic component companies, mobile device makers such
                                     as Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi account for a significant percentage of
                                     their revenues.
                             ■   Are the industry’s products standardized or undifferentiated?

                                 ●   Crude oil is graded (e.g., Brent, West Texas Intermediate) by its density
                                     and sulfur content, which determine its cost and the effort to refine it
                                     into products such as petroleum. Oil refiners pay for crude oil based
                                     on its grade, not by specific oil producer; crude oil within a grade is
                                     interchangeable.
                             ■   Are the industry’s products critical for customers?

                                 ●   Pesticides and seeds, especially those made with biotechnology, are sold
                                     at high prices but are vital to sustaining high agricultural yields and
                                     the high prices are outweighed by the cost of crops lost to disease and
                                     insects.
                             ■   Are the industry’s products a large part of customers’ budget?

                                 ●   Customers may be more motivated to seek alternatives and negotiate for
                                     products that account for a large part of their budget and for which qual-
                                     ity is not a paramount concern. For livestock farmers, the cost of feed
Industry Structure and External Influences                                                269


            accounts for over 60% of annual operating costs, while pharmaceuticals
            and vaccines for livestock account for a small percentage but come with
            a high cost of failure, which has given animal-pharmaceutical companies
            a strong bargaining position.
    ■   Can customers backward-integrate—that is, “build” rather than “buy” what
        the industry is selling?

        ●   Streaming video services first licensed content from existing studios and
            media companies, but over time they vertically integrated by producing
            their own video content.


Assessing the Bargaining Power of Suppliers

    ■   Are there few, concentrated suppliers for the industry?

        ●   Apple’s “A” and “M” series processors for its iPhones and MacBooks are
            manufactured exclusively by TSMC. While Apple has more supplier
            choice for its other components, it is beholden to a single company for
            this crucial component.
    ■   Are there significant costs for switching suppliers?

        ●   Asset managers need performance data and analytics on equity, fixed
            income, and other indexes for investment processes and client report-
            ing of benchmarks. Indexes are owned by a small number of companies
            and charge licensing fees for data permissions and commercial use. An,
            Benetton, Song, and Index Providers (2021) found that managers of
            indexed exchange-traded funds paid index licensing fees equal to 35% of
            their management fee revenue. While asset managers can switch because
            each provider offers similar catalogues of indexes, doing so would
            require changing investment processes, client reporting, and conversa-
            tions with clients—and can look bad to prospects.
    ■   Are suppliers differentiated or specialized?

        ●   Healthcare providers, airlines, investment banks, technology compa-
            nies, and professional services firms all require skilled, credentialed, or
            licensed labor, for which there is limited supply.
    ■   Are there substitutes for the products from suppliers?

        ●   Retailers can substitute branded merchandise for private label merchan-
            dise from contract manufacturers.


Assessing Rivalry among Existing Competitors

    ■   Is there a history of price competition among competitors?

        ●   Despite a low risk from every other industry force, automakers and air-
            craft manufacturers compete fiercely on price, offering promotions and
            generous financing and warranty terms to try to capture every sale.
    ■   Are there numerous, roughly equal-sized competitors?

        ●   There are approximately a dozen automakers with an annual global mar-
            ket share over 1%. However, the largest company (Toyota) has had less
            than 15% market share for many years.
    ■   Are products differentiated?
270   Learning Module 6                                                            Industry and Competitive Analysis


                                  ●   Pharmaceuticals without a patent (generics) are legally required to be
                                      chemically equivalent to their originator drug in order to be approved by
                                      regulators in an abbreviated process that doesn’t involve a clinical trial.
                                      Pharmacies are indifferent as to whether an approved generic is sold by
                                      one company or another and manufacturers’ costs are largely fixed, so
                                      the companies compete fiercely on price for volume. Price competition
                                      increases with the number of approved generics per originator drug;
                                      Dave, Hartzema, and Kesselheim (2017) found that a drug with one
                                      generic competitor had prices that were, on average, six times higher
                                      than the prices of one for which there were nine generic manufacturers.
                              ■   Are there high barriers to exiting?

                                  ●   If exiting an industry is difficult or costly, such as shutting down natural
                                      resource–producing assets, companies with low profitability may remain
                                      in the industry for much longer than in other industries, which can
                                      result in lingering competition.
                              ■   Is industry growth slow?

                                  ●   If penetration of the addressable market is low, companies may not feel
                                      a need to compete for customers using price and other economic terms.
                                      This was the case for mobile wireless plans until the mid-2010s, when
                                      penetration plateaued and companies began engaging in aggressive pro-
                                      motional activity in competition for one another’s customers.
                          After completing the evaluation of industry structure, an analyst must judge which
                          are the most and least important factors. It is often clear that one or two forces are
                          strongest, but there isn’t a quantitative test or threshold by which to judge definitively.
                          Posing scenarios to experienced industry insiders is often useful, such as asking, “What
                          do you think would happen if company X increased its prices by 10% tomorrow?” If
                          their answer is that a large percentage of customers are willing and able to switch to
                          a competitor or substitute—perhaps it has happened before—it’s likely that customer
                          bargaining power and the threat of substitutes warrant further investigation.

                          CASE STUDIES

                             Porter’s Five Forces Analysis for US Retail (ex
                             autos)


                             Threat of New Entrants: Very High

                             Opening a retailer, especially an e-commerce retailer that utilizes third-party
                             merchant services, is relatively easy and common. In the USA, retailers are the
                             most common type of business formed—by a wide margin, with over 40,000 new
                             firms filing formation papers each month (the next most common is transpor-
                             tation and warehousing, with around half the number of retailer formations).
                             Customers can easily switch retailers, as most do not have an ongoing relation-
                             ship such as a subscription fee or contract, and there are minimal regulatory
                             barriers such as licenses and patents.
                             Threat of Substitutes: Low

                             Broadly speaking, the substitute for retail is consumer services (e.g., restau-
                             rants, travel, healthcare), which also includes digital services (such as streaming
                             video subscriptions and gaming). Most categories of goods, however, are not
Industry Structure and External Influences                                                      271


   easily replaceable with services (e.g., apparel and home décor), or they enjoy
   a cost advantage because of lower labor intensity (e.g., fresh food). There have
   been periods when services grew faster than goods, but as shown in an earlier
   exhibit, retail sales have grown essentially in line with US nominal output/
   income. Retail is arguably one of the oldest industries, and while it has evolved
   over time, it has yet to be replaced.
   Bargaining Power of Customers: Moderate

   Retail customers are highly fragmented, with each consumer representing a
   distinct decision-maker, as there are generally no group purchasing organiza-
   tions. However, many products are sold by many retailers, and the internet has
   enabled easy comparison shopping at retailers. Customers are price sensitive
   with respect to identical products sold by different retailers.
   Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Low to Moderate

   Key suppliers for retailers include manufacturers of goods, employees, and lessors
   of retail or fulfillment space. In most cases, numerous options are available.
   However, branded goods are sold exclusively by a sole manufacturer that may
   impose high prices and other economic terms, like shelf space and visibility,
   and may want to sell only to certain retailers (e.g., makers of luxury goods may
   not sell to discount retailers in order to maintain exclusivity).
   Rivalry among Existing Competitors: High

   Given the sheer number of similarly sized firms selling similar or identical
   products, retailers compete fiercely, often with price promotions and discounts
   as price is one of the few ways they can lure customers away from competitors.



External Influences on Industry Growth
Analyzing the structure of an industry primarily involves looking inside the industry
and at close adjacencies such as customers, suppliers, and substitutes. It is import-
ant for analysts to look outside the industry for factors that influence the industry’s
economic outcomes. One framework for this purpose is a PESTLE analysis of the
political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental influences on an
industry. While Porter’s Five Forces is concerned with the determinants of industry
profitability, a PESTLE analysis is more concerned with an industry’s growth rate and
market share dynamics. For example, athletic apparel companies such as lululemon
athletica inc. have long benefited from increasing consumer interest in fitness and
wellness, a social influence on the apparel industry. This trend is not apparent from
Porter’s Five Forces but is obviously important for growth in athletic apparel. When
the trend eventually plateaus or declines, it’s likely to result in declining sales growth or
sales for lululemon, so analysts carefully monitor the trend using a variety of metrics.
PESTLE analysis is a framework for identifying “themes” or “narratives” that investors
may take a perspective on and desire exposure to.
    While analysts must look broadly for influences, several factors make this search
easier in practice. First, external influences often do not change very quickly (though
their magnitude and direction can), so this analysis does not need to be done every
quarter. Second, analysts develop industry expertise, and those in an institutional
setting can access industry specialists who offer their perspectives and surveillance
of industry trends as a paid service. Finally, it is usually the case that some influences
are far more important than others for a given industry.

                          Political Influences
                          Political influences on an industry include changing fiscal and monetary policies, gov-
                          ernments’ direct selling and purchasing activities, regulatory changes, and geopolitical
                          conditions and actions. We highlight three sectors and their constituent industries
                          for which political influences are often significant: energy, healthcare, and defense.
                              The energy sector is subject to three important political influences: the political
                          appeal of low and stable energy prices in the short run, climate agreements and leg-
                          islation calling for emissions reductions, and the actions of OPEC (Organization of
                          the Petroleum Exporting Countries). Most governments desire low energy prices in
                          the short run to maintain their appeal to consumers and businesses that have inelas-
                          tic demand with respect to price. However, in the long run, higher energy prices
                          (perhaps because of a carbon tax) might be preferable in order to curb demand and
                          meet emissions targets, for which the consumption of fossil fuels is the main driver.
                          Investors and producers may worry about the longer-term outlook, since governments
                          are intending to shrink fossil fuels as a percentage of the energy mix, but reductions
                          in fossil fuel production are at odds with low energy prices in the short run. Finally,
                          energy companies owned by member states of OPEC produced 35% of crude oil globally
                          in 2021 (BP Statistical Review of World Energy) and set production quotas as a bloc.
                          Actions taken by OPEC significantly affect global and regional energy prices. OPEC
                          members may choose to keep prices low enough to slow the transition to renewables,
                          exploiting governments’ need for low energy prices in the short run.
                              Governments are the largest buyers of healthcare products and services and, in
                          most cases, are the exclusive buyers of defense goods and services globally. For politi-
                          cal appeal and to shore up fiscal deficits, governments have at times pursued reforms
                          such as expansions of healthcare coverage and subsidies, price controls or reductions,
                          and restrictions on certain healthcare services or products.
                              Defense spending is determined by countries’ geopolitical objectives, perceived
                          threat environment, and alliance commitments. From the late 1990s to 2010, global
                          military spending rose markedly, increasing as a share of global GDP, which benefited
                          defense companies. Future defense spending depends on geopolitical events and
                          other competing budget priorities. Finally, governments also extensively regulate
                          healthcare and defense, the stringency of which changes over time. From 2000-2007,
                          several high-profile pharmaceutical scandals led to a period of heightened regulatory
                          scrutiny and a declining number of drug approvals. This scrutiny was relaxed by
                          the mid-2010s. Countries are selective about which countries they permit domestic
                          defense companies to do business with, and the contracting process is highly complex,
                          involving third-party costs and performance audits.

                          Economic Influences
                          Economic influences on an industry include changes in GDP or personal income,
                          inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates. These influences can be related to the
                          business cycle (cyclical) or structural, such as how longer-run population and produc-
                          tivity growth rates have differed across countries, which affects the sales and costs of
                          companies operating in different countries. Economic influences are most important
                          for cyclical sectors such as financials, basic materials, and consumer discretionary, and
                          exchange rate changes are most important for industries and companies operating in
                          multiple currencies—especially if there are large currency compositional mismatches
                          in revenues and costs and if the company does business in an illiquid currency with
                          more volatile exchange rates.
                              The auto industry is among the most affected by economic influences, because
                          it sells high-priced durable goods, the purchase of which can be delayed (consumer
                          keeps current car longer) or substituted (used car) based on consumer confidence.
                          Structural economic influences are important for many multinational companies that
Industry Structure and External Influences                                                  273


have sought to increase exposure to faster-growing emerging markets over time. As of
2022, over 40% of Nestlé SA’s sales were in emerging markets, which have long shown
faster volume growth than its developed-market sales.

Social Influences
Social influences include cultural and consumer trends, demographic changes such
as the relative growth rates among different population cohorts, and changes in life-
styles. These influences are not entirely external to an industry, as companies influence
culture through political advocacy, advertising, and a variety of other efforts such
as product placements in media. There is growing reputational risk and/or pressure
on companies via social media and the press to source sustainable inputs, as well as
increased scrutiny of supply chains for violations of human rights.
    Social influences are often more significant for industries that sell to consumers
rather than to other businesses. In concert with technological and economic influences,
the global beauty industry (comprising skin care, color cosmetics, hair care, fragrances,
and select personal care product categories) has grown briskly since 2010, particularly
premium products. High-quality cameras on mobile devices and social media have
increased the salience of people’s physical appearance and created efficient marketing
channels for beauty companies that utilize third-party influencers and video tutorials.

Technological Influences
Technological changes can create new or improved products or render existing products
obsolete, radically changing industries and companies. Based on the pioneering work
of Clayton Christensen, we distinguish between two kinds of technological changes:
sustaining and disruptive innovations.
    Sustaining innovations are improvements in product or service performance and
the addition of marginal features, but without a fundamental change in functionality
or operation. These innovations are often led by industry incumbents making improve-
ments to better serve existing or adjacent customers’ needs. Successive improvements
to cable television—including digital transmission, improved video quality, premium
programming, DVRs, and additional channels—represent sustaining innovations.
Disruptive innovation is a change that creates a new market or enters an existing one
but with a very different value proposition that may not immediately appeal to existing
customers who are happy with the current product. Cable television was disrupted
by streaming video delivered over the internet. At first a rudimentary offering that
appealed to people who did not have cable subscriptions, it eventually grew to overtake
cable in the number of subscribers.
    Disruptive innovation is most likely to come from new entrants, because they do
not have an existing profitable business to protect. The difficulty faced by incumbents
with disruptive innovation is termed the “innovator’s dilemma”: they can either invest
in the disruptive innovation themselves, speeding the decline of their existing busi-
ness (and potentially harming employees) but not losing market share, or ignore the
innovation and lose market share while continuing to generate strong profits in the
near to medium term.

Legal Influences
Legal influences on an industry include changes in laws and regulations from courts and
policymakers that alter an industry’s business practices or economic outcomes. These
influences, which are in addition to the fiscal and monetary policy changes discussed
earlier under political influences, are often more subtle changes to the “rules of the
road” governing industry affairs. Companies look to shape these influences through
policy advocacy and in legal proceedings of their own.
274   Learning Module 6                                                          Industry and Competitive Analysis


                              Examples of industries strongly affected by legal influences include tobacco and
                          cannabis. Jurisdictions have wide-ranging laws and regulations on the manufacturing,
                          distribution, marketing, sale, and use of tobacco products to discourage consumption
                          and the associated adverse health consequences, including secondhand smoke. Laws
                          cover advertising prohibitions, graphic images on packaging, minimum purchase age,
                          bans on smoking in public places, and limitations on nicotine content and flavor-
                          ings. These laws are in addition to the generally high taxes levied on tobacco, which
                          encourage non-taxable counterfeit activity that governments must police. Adoption of
                          or changes in these laws in various jurisdictions significantly affect tobacco industry
                          sales. In response to these influences, as well as broader social influences that have
                          resulted in declining cigarette sale volumes, the tobacco industry is primarily focused
                          on developing so-called reduced risk products that may pose fewer health risks and
                          therefore create a more favorable legal environment.
                              The cannabis industry is in an evolving legal environment, where certain jurisdic-
                          tions have legalized its production, sale, and use (Canada), while some have varying
                          laws at the sub-sovereign level (the USA) and most others still completely prohibit
                          cannabis (most of Asia).

                          Environmental Influences
                          Finally, environmental influences are often closely associated with legal influences and
                          include risks and opportunities related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy,
                          laws and practices concerning waste and land use, and environmental protections.
                              Transition risks and opportunities are important influences for sectors such as
                          energy, airlines, utilities, and autos, as they are involved in the production or con-
                          sumption of fossil fuels, which are responsible for carbon emissions. Due to changes
                          in regulations, taxes, consumer preferences, or voluntary actions, companies in these
                          sectors must evolve their business operations or face share losses to competing solu-
                          tions with lower-carbon emissions.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. In 2009, Amazon.com started Amazon Publishing, extending its
                               business into publishing books in addition to book retailing. From the per-
                               spective of a competing publisher, this is an example of:
                                A. decreasing the threat of substitutes.
                                B. decreasing the bargaining power of suppliers.
                                C. increasing the bargaining power of customers.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Amazon Publishing is an example of backward-integration, as it
                               could now produce and sell its own published content as well as other pub-
                               lishers’ content. The creation of Amazon Publishing increased the bargain-
                               ing power of Amazon as a customer and increased the level of competitive
                               rivalry in the publishing industry. Amazon Publishing would also increase
                               the threat of substitutes and the bargaining power of suppliers, as authors
                               and end users could work directly with Amazon.

                            2. Proposed government regulations for the restaurant industry would in-
                               troduce new compliance requirements for all new and existing facilities to
                               reduce the environmental impact of take-out and delivery options. These
                               regulations would apply only to restaurants with a physical address and
Industry Structure and External Influences                                              275


      would not apply to mobile restaurants (i.e., food trucks). For an existing
      restaurant with several physical locations, these regulations would:
      A. reduce competitive rivalry by increasing the barriers to entry.
      B. increase competitive rivalry by increasing the threat of substitutes.
       C. both reduce and increase competitive rivalry.
      Solution:
      C is correct. The proposed regulatory changes would have a mixed impact
      on the level of competitive rivalry in the restaurant industry. These environ-
      mental regulations would increase the entry barriers by increasing the costs
      of setting up a new restaurant, while also increasing the threat of substitutes
      by making it easier to open mobile restaurants, which do not have to comply
      with these regulations.

   Please refer to the Industry Survey for Warehouse Club Inc. and Iliso
   Marketplace Ltd. in the previous lesson to answer the following questions.

   3. To compete with online retailers, Warehouse Club Inc. is considering
      installing a sophisticated image recognition system in its stores to track
      and analyze consumer behavior in order to identify clothing items that
      were tried on but not purchased. For Warehouse, this change would be a
      ____________________ (sustaining or disruptive) innovation.
      Solution:
      For Warehouse, this change would be a sustaining innovation. Sustaining
      improvements focus on adding marginal features without a fundamental
      change in functionality or operation. For example, the proposed system
      would provide incremental customer and product knowledge but would
      not represent a fundamental change in Warehouse’s go-to-market strategy.
      Disruptive innovation is a change that creates a new market or enters an
      existing one with a different value proposition.

   4. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

      The CEO of Iliso Marketplace Ltd. expects revenue growth to be in line with
      US GDP growth for the next two fiscal years. As a result, the CEO approves
      an extension to an existing aggressive sales promotion and discount strategy
      that has been in place for the past 18 months. This extension will increase
      the competitive rivalry in the industry.
      Solution:
      False. The sales promotion and discount strategy is already in place within
      this mature industry, thus demonstrating a history of price competition
      among the competitors.

   5. A PESTLE analysis for Iliso Marketplace Ltd. would most likely identify
      which of the following items?
      A. A competitor is acquiring a fleet of delivery vehicles instead of using
         third-party parcel carriers.
      B. The increasing political discussion around instituting a tax on parcel
         deliveries of less than 2 kilograms
276   Learning Module 6                                                          Industry and Competitive Analysis


                                  C. A competitor is launching an augmented reality application to allow
                                     tech-savvy consumers to view home décor and furniture products in
                                     real time.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. The political discussion around potential applications of a tax
                                 is an example of a political trend changing over time. This theme could
                                 potentially affect Iliso Marketplace Ltd. A (fleet of delivery vehicles) and C
                                 (augmented reality) are examples of competitive actions that could affect the
                                 level of competitive rivalry in the industry.




              6           COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

                                         evaluate the competitive strategy and position of a company

                          All companies have a competitive strategy, whether intentional or not. An inten-
                          tional strategy results from company-wide planning, performance measurement,
                          and feedback loops to sharpen the strategy. An unintentional strategy results from
                          various teams within a firm pursuing their own incentives, doing whatever they did
                          in prior years, or following industry or professional norms. An unintentional strategy
                          is rarely the best and often exacerbates communication and coordination problems
                          present at every company, although the approach might perform well in areas such
                          as discovery-oriented research. Munos (2009) found evidence of diseconomies of
                          scale in pharmaceutical R&D, with most new drugs discovered by small companies
                          operating in a relatively “unmanaged” way.
                              Ultimately, an effective competitive strategy is evidenced by a company’s track
                          record of value added for its stakeholders, such as economic profits. Its effectiveness
                          can be judged only in hindsight. To evaluate a competitive strategy on a forward-looking
                          basis, an analyst should assess the strategy along three dimensions:
                             ■    Does the strategy create a defense against the five industry forces?
                             ■    Does the strategy benefit from, or is at least not at odds with, the expected
                                  external industry influences identified in the PESTLE analysis?
                             ■    Does the company have the resources and capabilities to execute the
                                  strategy?
                              Clearly, the analysis and the answers to these questions are company and industry
                          specific (CFA Institute has published a helpful industry-by-industry reference titled
                          Sector Analysis: A Framework for Investors with examples). We can, however, identify
                          three well-known competitive strategies that have worked in a variety of industries,
                          as shown in Exhibit 6: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. These three generic
                          strategies are based on Michael Porter’s research on competition. While companies
                          do tend to have specific variations, generic strategies explain a large percentage of
                          strategies in practice—similar to how many companies’ business models are well
                          described using conventional models. A poor situation is for a company to be “stuck
                          in the middle”—not a cost leader, not differentiated, not focused.

QUESTION SET


  1. Manitou Resorts is a 25-room boutique hotel located in a rural
     mountain area approximately three hours from a major urban center. It pro-
     vides accommodations, high-end dining options, and an on-site health and
     wellness spa. Manitou’s primary customers are young professional couples
278   Learning Module 6                                                      Industry and Competitive Analysis


                            in the middle-to-upper-income brackets. The CEO is contemplating several
                            options for expansion, as the resort is frequently at full capacity. Which of
                            the following initiatives would be consistent with Manitou’s current compet-
                            itive strategy?
                             A. The development of 10 stand-alone lakefront cottages to accommodate
                                families of up to six people, providing access to family-related activi-
                                ties such as pools, water sports, and evening entertainment
                             B. The addition of conference room facilities to accommodate corporate
                                events that could be priced at a 10%–15% discount to a 150-room
                                franchise hotel approximately 30 minutes from Manitou
                             C. Developing a management and reservation system to identify rec-
                                ommendations to referral partners such as golf courses, taxi/shuttle
                                services, or other guest experiences to increase fee revenue
                            Solution:
                            C is correct. Manitou Resorts’ current competitive strategy is a focus
                            strategy targeting a specific customer segment: young professionals in
                            middle-to-upper-income brackets located in a nearby city and focused on
                            wellness and relaxation. The other options represent an expansion into new
                            customer segments (family vacations and corporate events), which could be
                            inconsistent with its current customer base. A represents a cost leadership
                            competitive strategy, while B represents a differentiation strategy.

                          2. Warehouse Club Inc. is considering launching a “private label” brand of
                             non-perishable food products. Based on its current competitive strategy,
                             which of the following is the most appropriate rationale to support?
                             A. Customers do not notice product differences.
                             B. Customers value new product features and forms.
                             C. Products can be segmented into regular and premium brands.
                            Solution:
                            A is correct. Warehouse Club Inc.’s current competitive strategy is cost lead-
                            ership. In a cost leadership strategy, industry appropriateness is determined
                            by capital intensity, price-conscious customers, customers not valuing or
                            noticing product differences, and minimal innovation in the industry. B
                            represents an example of a differentiation strategy. C represents an example
                            of a focus strategy.

                          3. To defend against the bargaining power of suppliers, customers may be
                             unable or unwilling to comparison shop or switch in which of the following
                             competitive strategies (select all that apply):

                            ___ Cost leadership

                            ___ Differentiation

                            ___ Focus
                            Solution:
                            Both differentiation and focus. That “customers may be unable or unwilling
                            to comparison shop or switch” is a common feature of both differentiation
                            and focus strategies. In a cost leadership strategy, “customers can only bring
Competitive Positioning                                                               279


     prices down to the costs of the marginal producer, leaving margin for the
     cost leaders.”

  4. A risk to a differentiation competitive strategy is:
      A. limited market share due to exclusivity.
      B. larger competitors outcompete on price.
      C. technological change that results in loss of market share.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Since a differentiation strategy pursues a unique product or
     service offering, it creates a risk that the strategy may preclude high market
     share, as customers value exclusivity. B is a risk to a focus strategy where
     larger competitors outcompete on price. C is a risk to a cost leadership
     strategy where the technological change results in cost leadership or market
     share loss.

  5. A large online retailer in the USA has begun to offer a “price-matching”
     guarantee on its website to match any competitor’s online price for an iden-
     tical product, including Iliso Marketplace. Recommend and justify whether
     Iliso should launch a similar guarantee to protect its market share.
     Solution:
     No, Iliso should not launch a similar guarantee. A price-matching guarantee
     is a strategy pursued by companies with a cost leadership approach by using
     aggressive pricing to gain volume. Iliso Marketplace Ltd. operates with a dif-
     ferentiation strategy that permits premium pricing if aligned with a strong
     customer experience. If Iliso maintained its customer experience offering
     and began to reduce its revenue to match cost leaders, the company would
     likely decrease its overall profitability.

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1. An alternative method of grouping companies by geography is least likely to be
   completed using:
   A. location of head office.

   B. geographic composition of revenue.

   C. primary listing of its equity securities.

2. A market consists of three firms with market shares of 50%, 30%, and 20%. The
   Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is closest to:
   A. 0.38.

   B. 2,500.

   C. 3,800.

3. Lower industry concentration is usually associated with a high degree of compet-
   itive intensity unless the industry is most likely:
   A. global.

   B. service-oriented.

   C. one with low product differentiation.

4. Increased environmental regulations on automotive manufacturers will most
   likely have which of the following effects on the threat of new entrants?
   A. An increase

   B. A decrease

   C. No change

5. The CEO of a large law firm is concerned about a new mobile application that
   uses algorithms to auto-complete legal forms and questions in discovery and
   provides recommendations for small-claims matters at a much lower cost than
   a traditional law firm charges. As a result, the CEO is contemplating whether
   the firm should develop and launch its own branded application, which would
   affect its short-term profitability but maintain its existing customer base, or give
   up market share to focus on more complex claims with higher profitability. This
   scenario is an example of:
   A. defensiveness.

   B. innovator’s dilemma.

   C. sustaining innovation.

6. PESTLE analysis is a framework for identifying:
   A. industry themes.

   B. the level of industry concentration.

   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. Classification by country is typically by the country where the issuer
   is incorporated, the country of the primary listing of its equity securities, the
   location of its headquarters, or market perception. Note that classification by the
   geographic composition of revenue is generally not the approach taken, though
   this aspect may be the foremost concern for an analyst.

2. C is correct. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is calculated as the sum of
   the squares of competitor market shares. In this example, the HHI is calculated
   as (502 + 302 + 202 = 3,800). A incorrectly calculates the HHI using the percent-
   age market shares (0.52 + 0.32 + 0.22 = 0.38). B incorrectly calculates the HHI
   using only the market leader concentration (502 = 2,500).

3. B is correct. Lower industry concentration, defined as many small competitors
   in the market, is usually associated with a high degree of competitive intensity
   unless the industry is service-oriented, is local in nature, or has high product
   differentiation.

4. B is correct. Increased environmental regulations on automotive manufacturers
   represent an additional cost for compliance when building a new manufacturing
   facility and increase the barriers to entry into the industry.

5. B is correct. The described mobile application represents a fundamental change
   in the business model of a law firm. The application is a disruptive, not sustain-
   ing, innovation, as it brings new entrants into the market but with a very different
   value proposition. The CEO’s decision represents the “innovator’s dilemma”: the
   firm can either invest in the disruptive innovation, speeding the decline of its
   existing business but not losing market share, or ignore the innovation and lose
   market share while continuing to generate strong profits in the near term.

6. A is correct. PESTLE analysis is a framework for identifying “themes” or “narra-
   tives” that investors may take a perspective on and desire exposure to. B refers to
   the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. C refers to Porter’s Five Forces.

7. A is correct. Proximity to customers is a means of executing a focus strategy. The
   means of executing a cost leadership strategy include economies of scale from
   fixed costs, favorable access to raw materials, a culture of strict cost control,
   aggressive pricing to gain high volume, low-cost distribution, and economies of
   scope.

8. A is correct. The risks of a differentiation strategy include imitation by compet-
   itors, buyers becoming sophisticated and no longer demanding level of service,
   and pricing premiums becoming too high for customers to beat; such a strategy
   may also preclude high market share, as customers value exclusivity. B relates to a
   focus strategy, while C relates to a cost leadership strategy.

INTRODUCTION
Forecasts of companies’ financial statements are used by analysts in valuation and
                                                                                         1
to make investment recommendations. Developing the forecasts or projections is
an important aspect of an analyst’s job and is the focus of this module. In the first
lesson, what to forecast, approaches to forecasting, and selecting a forecast horizon
are discussed. The next three lessons focus on particular forecasts: revenues, operat-
ing expenses and working capital, and capital investments and capital structure. The
final lesson discusses the use of scenario analysis in considering multiple outcomes.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Four common types of forecast objects are drivers of financial
          statement lines, individual financial statement lines, summary
          measures, and ad hoc objects. An analyst’s choice of forecast object
          depends on available information, efficiency, accuracy, explanatory
          value, and verifiability.
      ■   Forecast approaches generally are based on historical results, historical
          base rates and convergence, management guidance, or analyst discre-
          tion. An analyst’s choice of forecast approach depends on the compa-
          ny’s industry structure, sensitivity to the business cycle, and business
          model, as well as the reliability and availability of information.
286   Learning Module 7                                                           Company Analysis: Forecasting


                              ■   The choice of the forecast time horizon is determined by the invest-
                                  ment strategy for which the security is being considered, the cyclicality
                                  of the industry, company-specific factors, and the analyst’s employer’s
                                  preferences.
                              ■   Revenue forecasts may be based on top-down or bottom-up forecast
                                  objects, using any of the four forecast approaches. Using different
                                  forecast objects and approaches to project revenue can be useful in
                                  uncovering implicit assumptions or errors in any single approach.
                              ■   Top-down revenue drivers include growth relative to GDP growth,
                                  and market growth and market share. Bottom-up revenue drivers
                                  include volumes and average selling prices; revenue by product line,
                                  geographic area, or reporting segment; capacity-based measures; and
                                  return-based measures.
                              ■   Analysts often use aggregated forecast objects or summary measures
                                  to forecast operating expenses because of a lack of disaggregated infor-
                                  mation. However, forecasts for operating expenses should be coherent
                                  with revenue forecasts. The choice of forecast object can vary depend-
                                  ing on the forecast horizon.
                              ■   Working capital forecasts typically use efficiency ratios combined
                                  with revenue and operating expense forecasts to project accounts
                                  receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and other current assets and
                                  liabilities.
                              ■   Forecasts for capital expenditures may differentiate between mainte-
                                  nance and growth capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expen-
                                  diture forecasts are often based on depreciation and amortization
                                  expenses. Growth capital expenditure forecasts are tied to a company’s
                                  strategy, expansion plans, and revenue growth.
                              ■   Forecasts about a company’s capital structure consider historical lever-
                                  age ratios and capital structure, the company’s financial strategy, and
                                  capital expenditure forecasts.
                              ■   Based on a company’s risk factors, an analyst may develop several
                                  forecast scenarios rather than develop a single forecast. The analyst
                                  will judge the likelihood of each scenario occurring.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. A benefit of using summary measures as forecast objects is most likely:
                              A. efficiency.
                              B. transparency.
                              C. explanatory value.
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. The benefit of using summary measures as a forecast object is
                             efficiency, as fewer variables need to be forecast, but a disadvantage is less
                             transparency. Forecasting financial statement lines or their drivers has the
                             benefit of improved explanatory value.
Introduction                                                                            287


  2. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate for forecasting annu-
     al revenues for a company in a cyclical industry?
      A. Historical results
      B. Management guidance
      C. Analyst’s discretionary forecast
     Solution:
     C is correct. An analyst’s discretionary forecast is most appropriate, because
     it allows the analyst to consider both the current phase and the expected
     future phase of the business cycle. Historical results are a less appropriate
     forecast approach for companies in cyclical industries, because a future pe-
     riod is likely to be at a different point in the business cycle than the current
     or past period, and so results will differ. The use of guidance for companies
     that are highly sensitive to the business cycle is less appropriate, as manage-
     ment does not have an informational advantage over investors in forecasting
     macroeconomic variables like GDP or the prices of commodities.

  3. An example of a top-down driver for revenue is a company’s:
      A. market share.
      B. sales growth rate.
      C. products’ average selling price.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Top-down drivers of revenue include the company’s market
     share and the industry’s market growth. The company’s sales growth rate
     and products’ average selling price are bottom-up drivers of revenue.

  4. In developing a revenue forecast, non-recurring revenue most likely:
      A. has the same drivers as recurring revenue.
      B. will be disclosed by a company’s management.
      C. is considered separately from recurring revenue.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Non-recurring items and effects should be considered separate-
     ly. The non-recurring objects, such as changes in exchange rates or provi-
     sions for legal costs, generally do not have the same drivers as the recurring
     objects. While management may disclose some non-recurring items and
     effects, there are also non-recurring items and effects that management
     does not disclose, which require analyst judgment.

  5. An analyst should consider the effects of changing commodity prices when
     forecasting:
      A. revenue only.
      B. cost of sales only.
      C. both revenue and cost of sales.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Both a company’s cost of sales through input prices and its rev-
     enue may be affected by commodity prices. The effect on revenue depends
     on the company’s competitive positioning and the price elasticity of demand
     for the company’s products.

                           6. Working capital forecasts for a mature company with a unique business
                              model are most likely made by:
                              A. increasing the current assets and liabilities by the sales growth rate.
                              B. using the company’s efficiency ratios combined with sales and operat-
                                 ing forecasts.
                               C. using a historical base rate and convergence approach to develop fore-
                                  casts of revenue, operating expenses, and efficiency ratios.
                              Solution:
                              B is correct. For a company with a unique business model, using a historical
                              results approach is appropriate. Working capital forecasts are typically made
                              by using efficiency ratios, which are combined with sales and operating cost
                              forecasts to project accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and
                              other current assets and liabilities. The historical base rate and convergence
                              approach is appropriate if the company is converging toward the norm for
                              the industry. Adjusting current assets and liabilities by the sales growth rate
                              is not appropriate, because changes in sales will affect each item differently.

                           7. Depreciation and amortization expenses are often used as the basis for:
                              A. growth capital expenditures only.
                              B. maintenance capital expenditures only.
                               C. both growth and maintenance capital expenditures.
                              Solution:
                              B is correct. Maintenance capital expenditure forecasts are often based on
                              depreciation and amortization expenses. Growth capital expenditure fore-
                              casts are more discretionary and are tied to management’s expansion plans
                              and revenue growth.

                           8. Which of the following generic risk factors is most likely to affect an estab-
                              lished company in the consumer staples sector?
                              A. Inflation or deflation
                              B. Technological developments
                               C. Changes in the business cycle
                              Solution:
                              A is correct. While all of these choices are generic risk factors, inflation or
                              deflation is the one most likely to affect an established company in the con-
                              sumer staples sector. The consumer staples sector is not likely to experience
                              significant technological developments and is generally not sensitive to
                              changes in the business cycle.




              2           FORECAST OBJECTS, PRINCIPLES, AND APPROACHES

                                      explain principles and approaches to forecasting a company’s
                                      financial results and position
Forecast Objects, Principles, and Approaches                                                289


Approaches to forecasting vary by analyst and setting. Analysts who publish company
research for external distribution tend to maintain quarterly forecasts and invest a
great deal of effort to achieve forecast accuracy of revenue and earnings per share
estimates. An investor with a controlling position in a private company has access
to far more information, which may be used to build highly detailed models with a
multi-year or even multi-decade perspective. Additionally, there are forecasting norms
that vary by business model of the target company, such that models for banks appear
markedly different from those for oil and gas producers.
    In this module, we take the perspective of a longer-term-oriented analyst forecasting
relatively straightforward public issuers—Warehouse Club Inc. and Iliso Marketplace
Ltd., introduced in the prior two modules—but the principles discussed are broadly
applicable. The more technical details of financial statement modeling using spread-
sheets are covered in lessons in Financial Statement Analysis.


What to Forecast?
Analysts may focus on different forecast objects related to issuers’ financial state-
ments. Below are four common forecast objects.
   1. Drivers of financial statement lines, which were illustrated in the earlier
      module on company analysis. Recall that for Warehouse Club Inc., net sales
      each year was analyzed using two bottom-up drivers: the average number
      of stores open and the average net sales per store, both of which were also
      analyzed using year-over-year percentage changes over the last 10 years.
      Forecasts of net sales (at the top of Warehouse’s income statement) can be
      made by forecasting these drivers individually and multiplying them. Gross
      margin and SG&A expenses as percentages of net sales were identified as
      key drivers of operating expenses, which can be forecast and then multi-
      plied by the net sales forecast to obtain the forecast cost of sales and SG&A
      expenses. Forecasting drivers rather than financial statement lines outright
      has the benefit of improved explanatory value and may improve accuracy; a
      financial statement line item can have multiple drivers moving in different
      directions, which might be difficult to forecast on an aggregated basis.
   2. Individual financial statement lines. Rather than drivers, analysts can also
      directly forecast individual financial statement lines. This approach is often
      used for lines without clear drivers, for less-material items, and for items
      that the analyst does not have a perspective on. In some cases, the analyst
      may look for an estimate by management or simply assume the quantity
      will remain the same in future periods as in the past. Examples include lines
      such as amortization expense on the income statement (a forecast for which
      is often provided by management in the annual report), “other non-current
      assets” on the balance sheet (when small), and various lines on statements of
      cash flows for which minimal disclosures are provided.
   3. Summary measures such as free cash flow, earnings per share, and total
      assets. The benefit of using these as forecast objects is efficiency. The dis-
      advantage is less transparency, making it difficult to audit the forecast. This
      approach is most appropriate if the summary measure is stable and predict-
      able, or if issuer disclosures are severely limited.
   4. Ad hoc objects, which may not yet be reported on historical financial
      statements. In some cases, an analyst may need to forecast a loss or gain
      and its timing to make an investment decision with respect to the compa-
      ny’s equity or debt securities before the issuer recognizes an accrual on its
290   Learning Module 7                                                              Company Analysis: Forecasting


                                 financial statements. Examples of such cases include an issuer’s announcing
                                 a material legal proceeding, government regulatory action, a tax dispute, or
                                 a natural disaster.



                          Focus on Objects That Are Regularly Disclosed
                          We recommend using forecast objects that either are disclosed regularly or can be
                          directly calculated using what is disclosed regularly (e.g., for Warehouse Club: net
                          sales, number of stores, net sales per store, national retail sales published monthly by
                          a government agency). Information that is not disclosed regularly (such as the size of a
                          market from a third-party consultancy’s report) is suitable for informing forecasts but
                          can be problematic for direct use because forecasts cannot be confirmed in a timely
                          manner. While it may be intuitive to forecast sales and gross margin by individual
                          product line for a company, if gross margin is disclosed only on a consolidated basis,
                          it will be difficult for the analyst to verify product-line gross margin estimates. If the
                          company’s reported gross margin results differ from gross margin estimates, is the
                          forecast off on product A, B, or C? Similarly, if a quantity is disclosed only on an
                          annual basis, a forecast of it can be confirmed only once a year.
                              We also caution against overly complex models, because they require more fore-
                          casts and take more time to update, often without any improvement in accuracy. For
                          example, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG discloses revenues on a
                          quarterly basis for over 35 individual drugs by US and Rest of World regions. Most
                          of the drugs are approved for more than one type of illness. The company also has
                          over 50 drugs in late-stage clinical development that may drive future revenue. While
                          an analyst could forecast Novartis AG’s revenues by forecasting sales for each of its
                          individual drugs by illness and geography, it would take months to create such a model
                          and weeks to update it every quarter, and the forecasts by illness are not verifiable over
                          time based on the company’s disclosures. Instead, the analyst should use judgment to
                          focus on the most important drivers and use aggregations and shortcuts where the
                          value-added of discrete forecasting is low. For example, it would not be a good use of
                          an analyst’s time to forecast sales for drugs with small addressable markets or those that
                          have reached maturity and will exhibit slow growth until they lose patent protection.


                          Forecast Approaches
                          For any object, there are four general forecast approaches, as shown in Exhibit 1. In
                          practice, they are often combined.

Historical Results: Assume Past is Precedent
This approach uses past observed or calculated values (such as a historical median) as
a forecast. This is the easiest approach and is, perhaps, the default. Because the past
occurred at least once before, it seems plausible to expect that it will again. However,
past results were produced in past conditions, which may differ from current and
future conditions.

USING HISTORICAL RESULTS AS FORECASTS

   An analyst is forecasting the market size for energy drinks, a type of non-alco-
   holic ready-to-drink beverage. The analyst uses two drivers: a forecast of the
   market for non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and energy drinks’ share of
   that market. Sales of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages have grown, on
   average, by 3% per year for the last 10 years. Since the analyst does not expect
   any material changes in conditions, she forecasts that the market will continue
   to grow by 3% per year.
       The analyst believes that energy drinks bear some similarities to sports drinks,
   another type of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage, which has achieved a
   market share of 20%. The analyst thus forecasts that energy drinks will also
   reach a market of 20% by 2035. These two forecasts are multiplied to arrive at
   a forecast market size for energy drinks.

    This approach may be appropriate for companies operating in industries where
the analyst does not expect the industry structure (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces, PESTLE
influences) to change, as well as for companies that have a low sensitivity to changes
in the business cycle. This approach is also commonly used for forecast objects that
are not material or that the analyst does not hold an opinion on.
    Historical results are a less appropriate forecast approach for companies in cyclical
industries, because a future period is likely to be at a different point in the business
cycle than the current or past period, and so results will differ. An “over the cycle”
average or median may be appropriate for a multi-year forecast for a cyclical company,

                          but less appropriate for a specific year as such an average or median disguises the
                          year-to-year volatility. This forecast approach is also less appropriate for companies
                          that are changing their competitive strategy or restructuring in some way, such as
                          making a large acquisition or divestiture that renders historical results non-comparable.

                          Historical Base Rates and Convergence
                          This approach uses an industry or peer group average or median, computed over a
                          long period of time, as a “base rate” for forecasting that an object will converge to
                          over some time frame. The base rate could also be a macroeconomic variable such
                          as GDP growth. This approach is not a rote historical exercise, as analyst discretion
                          is required in selecting the object, the sample to calculate the base rate, and a time
                          frame for convergence to the base rate.

                          HISTORICAL BASE RATES AND CONVERGENCE

                             Tesla is a relatively new entrant in the automotive industry, with an innovative
                             suite of electric vehicles. An analyst may forecast Tesla’s income statement by
                             forecasting that its sales growth, gross and operating margins, capital intensity,
                             and capital structure will converge to historical automotive industry averages
                             (using a peer group of publicly traded global automakers) over the next 10 years.
                                 This forecast may be contested by other analysts who believe that the shift
                             from internal combustion to electric vehicles, Tesla’s innovative battery tech-
                             nology, and its direct-to-consumer sales approach make historical auto industry
                             averages irrelevant for Tesla.

                              Historical base rates and convergence may be appropriate for forecasting companies
                          in well-established industries with many publicly traded peers, such as banks, airlines,
                          restaurants, automakers, and retailers, especially when the analyst’s industry analysis
                          does not call for material changes in industry structure or external industry influences.
                          This approach is also logical for smaller companies that are “maturing into” a financial
                          profile similar to that of larger peers with scale. For example, a biotechnology com-
                          pany that recently launched its first drug likely spends more than half its revenues on
                          R&D, a ratio that is likely to decline toward the industry norm as the company scales.
                              This approach is less appropriate for companies in changing or new industries
                          for which calculating a base rate is difficult or less relevant, for companies in highly
                          cyclical industries for which a longer-term base rate and smooth convergence to it
                          would obscure year-to-year volatility, and for companies that are industry leaders
                          by a wide margin and account for a substantial proportion of any industry base rate.
                          For example, “digital advertising industry” averages for sales growth and operating
                          margins would be dominated by Alphabet and Meta, such that using them to forecast
                          Alphabet’s and Meta’s financial results would simply be using their own historical
                          results as the forecast, which may ignore any benefit from economies of scale (as the
                          companies were smaller in the past).

                          Management guidance
                          Management of public companies may publicly provide targets for earnings, revenues,
                          and other measures (e.g., capital expenditures) for the next quarter, year, or longer
                          term, known as management guidance (or simply as guidance). Guidance can be
                          detailed or rather directional and is often updated throughout the year. Initial guidance
                          for next fiscal year might be provided during the fourth-quarter earnings call and
                          updated for completed quarters, and new information provided at the first-, second-,
                          and third-quarter earnings calls. Beyer et al. (2010) found that guidance accounts
                          for a majority of the quarterly financial reporting information used by investors. Its
Forecast Objects, Principles, and Approaches                                                293


importance stems from its forward-looking rather than backward-looking nature,
and because management has an abundance of industry and company information
that investors do not.
    Guidance is often provided as a range (e.g., “sales growth of 2%–4%”) and embeds
many sub-forecasts and assumptions by management, including macroeconomic
growth, cost inflation, market share changes, pricing actions, and changes in exchange
rates. If management’s estimates for these change, so will guidance, and it is not uncom-
mon for companies to suspend guidance altogether in periods of high uncertainty,
such as during the COVID-19 pandemic or in recessions. A key focus of investors is
understanding management’s assumptions embedded in guidance and scrutinizing
their plausibility.
    While the midpoint of a guidance range might be intuitively interpreted as man-
agement’s “true” expectations, Ciconte et al. (2013) found that the upper bound often
better represents management’s expectations, which are “padded” by associating it
with a pessimistic lower bound to create a hurdle that is more easily cleared, for which
management can be rewarded.

SHORT- AND LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE

   Novo Nordisk A/S is a large biopharmaceutical company with shares and
   American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) listed on the NASDAQ Copenhagen and
   NYSE, respectively. Its management provides annual guidance that it updates
   each quarter, as well as less detailed but longer-term “strategic aspirations” during
   its annual Capital Markets Day presentations. Guidance includes management’s
   point and range estimates for the following (for each fiscal year):
       ■   Sales growth
       ■   Operating profit growth
       ■   Net interest income/expense
       ■   Effective tax rate
       ■   Capital expenditures
       ■   Depreciation and amortization
       ■   Free cash flow

    Using guidance for forecasts is appropriate when it is provided and when manage-
ment has demonstrated a track record of reliable estimates (analysts should analyze
past guidance versus actuals). We caution against the use of guidance for companies
that are highly sensitive to the business cycle, as management does not have an infor-
mational advantage over investors at forecasting macroeconomic variables like GDP
or the prices of commodities. Hutton et al. (2012) found that investors have an infor-
mational advantage at the macroeconomic level, while management has an advantage
at the firm level and tends to make more accurate forecasts for objects under greater
management control, such as operating expenses and capital expenditures.

Analyst’s discretionary forecast
We group all other forecast approaches as analysts’ discretionary forecasts, which
include those based on surveys, quantitative models, probability distributions, anal-
ogies to historical precedents that differ from comparable companies or industry
averages, and other unobservable inputs. This approach is most common for compa-
nies in cyclical industries, companies that have no or few comparables, those that do
not provide management guidance, and/or those undergoing a fundamental change
like a shift in the competitive or regulatory environment. For example, while shifts
in energy production have happened before (e.g., coal to natural gas), climate change
294   Learning Module 7                                                                Company Analysis: Forecasting


                          and the potential shift to renewable energy and adoption of technologies like electric
                          vehicles are unprecedented, with no historical observations to use as forecasts. Instead,
                          an energy sector analyst must make discretionary forecasts based on many sources,
                          such as government emission reduction commitments, proposed legislation, capital
                          expenditure constraints, and so on.

                          DISCRETIONARY FORECASTS

                             An analyst is building a financial statement model for a medical technology
                             company developing a new device to treat a type of stroke for which no other
                             effective treatments exist. The analyst uses information from the device’s clinical
                             trials and epidemiology data from various medical journals to estimate the total
                             addressable market of patients that are treatable with the device. The analyst also
                             conducts a survey of specialist physicians to gauge their interest in using the
                             device and to estimate the number of patients they would use it for (depending
                             on the results of the clinical trials), and uses recent launches of other medical
                             devices for neuro- and cardiovascular diseases to estimate market share for this
                             device for the next 10 years. The analyst develops several market share scenarios
                             based on the results of the clinical trials (i.e., the safer and more effective the
                             device, the higher sales growth will be). While the analyst uses comparable,
                             historical results as inputs, significant judgment is also required because this
                             situation is unique.



                          Selecting a Forecast Horizon
                          The choice of the forecast time horizon is determined by the investment strategy for
                          which the security is being considered, the cyclicality of the industry, company-specific
                          factors, and the analyst’s employer’s preferences. Most professionally managed invest-
                          ment strategies describe the investment time frame and average holding period in the
                          investment objectives of the strategy. For example, long-term-oriented fund managers
                          may focus their forecasting primarily on a time period of three to five years, while
                          shorter-term-oriented managers may focus more on the next one or two quarters.
                              The cyclicality of the industry could also influence the analyst’s choice of time
                          frame, because the forecast period should be long enough to allow the business to
                          reach an expected mid-cycle level of sales and profitability. Similar to cyclicality, various
                          company-specific factors, including recent acquisition or restructuring activity, can
                          influence the selection of the forecast period to allow enough time for the realization of
                          the expected benefits from such activity to be reflected in the financial statements. In
                          other cases, there might be no individual analyst choice in the sense that the analyst’s
                          employer has specified fixed parameters.

                             1. A company discloses financial results by geographic area, and the
                                economic exposure of each geographic area is similar. Explain why an ana-
                                lyst should or should not develop forecasts by geographic area and aggregate
                                the results.
                                Solution:
                                An analyst should not develop forecasts by geographic area, because each
                                area has similar economic exposure. Developing forecasts for each geo-
                                graphic area would require more time to develop and update, without a
                                significant improvement in accuracy over an aggregate forecast.

  2. Which approach is most appropriate for an analyst to use to forecast reve-
     nue for an industry leader in a mature, non-cyclical industry?
      A. Historical results
      B. Analyst’s discretionary forecast
      C. Historical base rates and convergence
     Solution:
     A is correct. Historical results is appropriate for companies operating in
     mature industries where the analyst does not expect the industry structure
     to change and for companies with low sensitivity to the business cycle. Ana-
     lyst’s discretionary forecast is most common for companies that have no or
     few comparables, do not provide management guidance, and/or are under-
     going a fundamental change. Historical base rates and convergence is not
     appropriate, because the company is an industry leader and would account
     for a substantial proportion of any industry base rate.

  3. Which of the following statements about management guidance is most
     accurate?
      A. The availability of guidance increases during periods of high
         uncertainty.
      B. The midpoint of guidance best represents management’s “true”
         expectations.
      C. Understanding the assumptions behind the guidance is critical to
         assessing the guidance.
     Solution:
     C is correct. A key focus of an analyst is to understand management’s as-
     sumptions embedded in guidance and to scrutinize their plausibility.
     It is not uncommon for companies to suspend guidance altogether in peri-
     ods of high uncertainty. While the midpoint of a guidance range might be
     intuitively interpreted as management’s “true” expectations, management
     may provide a range specifically intended to create a hurdle that is more
     easily cleared, for which management can be rewarded.

  4. Which of the following is an example of an ad hoc forecast object?
      A. Amortization expense
      B. Average sales per store
      C. Pending legal proceedings
     Solution:
     C is correct. Ad hoc objects are those that may not yet be reflected in his-
     torical financial statements. Amortization expense is an individual financial
     statement line. Average sales per store is a bottom-up driver of a financial
     statement line (revenue).




FORECASTING REVENUES

                          After the forecast time horizon is determined, a revenue forecast requires the selection
                          of the forecast objects and approach.


                          Forecast Objects for Revenues
                          Forecast objects for revenues are typically either top-down or bottom-up drivers, as
                          discussed in the earlier module on company analysis. Common top-down forecast
                          objects include “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share.”
                              Growth relative to GDP growth. The analyst first forecasts the growth rate of
                          nominal GDP. The analyst then considers how the growth rate of the specific com-
                          pany being examined will compare with nominal GDP growth. The analyst can use a
                          forecast for real GDP growth to project volumes and a forecast for inflation to proj-
                          ect prices. Analysts often think in terms of percentage point premiums or discounts
                          derived from a company’s position in its life cycle (e.g., growth, mature, or decline)
                          or business cycle sensitivity. Thus, an analyst’s conclusion might be that a healthcare
                          company’s revenue will grow at a rate of 200 bps above the nominal GDP growth rate.
                          The forecast could also be in relative terms. Thus, if GDP is forecast to grow at 4% and
                          the company’s revenue is forecast to grow at a 50% faster rate, the forecast percentage
                          change in revenue would be 4% × (1 + 0.50) = 6.0%, or 200 bps higher than the GDP
                          growth rate forecast in absolute terms.
                              Market growth and market share. The analyst first forecasts a growth rate for a
                          company’s product market, and then considers the company’s current market share
                          and how that share is likely to change over time. For example, if a company is expected
                          to maintain an 8% market share of a given product market and the product market
                          is forecast to grow from CNY144 billion to CNY154 billion in annual revenue, the
                          forecast growth in company revenue goes from a level of 8% × CNY144 billion =
                          CNY11.5 billion to a level of 8% × CNY154 billion = CNY12.3 billion (considering this
                          product market alone). If the product market revenue has a predictable relationship
                          with GDP, regression analysis might be used to estimate the relationship.
                              In contrast, an analyst could select bottom-up drivers as the forecast objects, which
                          are then aggregated to arrive at a forecast of total revenue for the company. Examples
                          of bottom-up drivers for revenue forecasts include the following:
                             ■   Volumes and average selling prices. Forecasts for volumes and prices of the
                                 company’s products are prepared individually and multiplied to arrive at
                                 a revenue forecast. This approach is commonly used for companies that
                                 disclose these quantities, such as media and internet companies (users and
                                 revenues per user), airlines, asset managers (i.e., AUM and management
                                 fee rates), and commodity producers. Many companies disclose price and
                                 volume contributions to overall revenue growth, which can be used as the
                                 forecast object as well.
                             ■   Product-line or segment revenues. Forecasts for individual products, product
                                 or business lines, geographic areas, or reporting segments are made and
                                 then aggregated into a total revenue forecast. This approach is commonly
                                 used if a company makes such disclosures and if the objects have different
                                 economic exposures.
                             ■   Capacity-based measures. Forecasts, for example, in retailing, based on the
                                 number of stores and sales per store, or same-store sales growth (for stores
                                 that have been open for at least 12 months) and sales related to new-store
                                 openings.
                             ■   Return- or yield-based measures. Forecasts based on account balances and
                                 revenue yields on them. For example, net interest income for a bank can be
                                 calculated as loans multiplied by the average interest rate minus the product
                                 of deposits and liabilities and their average interest rate.
Forecasting Revenues                                                                       297


    Using elements of both top-down and bottom-up objects can be useful for uncov-
ering implicit assumptions or errors that could arise from using a single approach
(e.g., forecasting revenues using bottom-up drivers but checking against what this
approach would imply for the company’s market size and share).

Separating Recurring and Non-Recurring Revenue or Revenue Growth
An important principle is that non-recurring items and effects should be excluded
from a forecast object and considered separately. The non-recurring objects generally
do not have the same drivers as the recurring object and may inflate or deflate its
size. There are two types of non-recurring items and effects: those that are disclosed
by a company’s management and those that are not, which require analyst judgment
to identify.
    For revenue, the first type includes the effect of changes in exchange rates, extra
selling days and weeks in the period, acquisitions/divestitures, and other “one-time”
revenues or gains. These are separated from a revenue forecast object so that “underly-
ing” revenue or growth can be forecast apart from the non-recurring items (for which
a discrete forecast may not be made at all). This is generally a straightforward task
unless the credibility of an issuer’s financial reporting is in doubt, in which case the
analyst may judge certain “non-recurring” items as, in fact, recurring. Some analysts
may also use proprietary exchange rate forecasts in revenue projections.
    The second type of non-recurring items is those not quantified by management
and that require analyst judgment to estimate. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic
had numerous economic effects, including a rapid increase in e-commerce sales as
a percentage of retail sales in most geographies. Many believed that this effect was
a “new normal,” that the increase in e-commerce sales would recur and subsequent
periods would show growth from the newly achieved level. By the second half of 2021,
this belief was called into question, because e-commerce sales as a percentage of retail
sales began to decline, returning to a trend established prior to the pandemic. Many
e-commerce companies saw revenue decelerate or decline in 2022, confirming that
some amount of e-commerce’s COVID-19-related growth was, in fact, non-recurring.
As a second example, graphic processing units (GPUs) are types of semiconductors
used in a variety of applications, including gaming PCs. GPU manufacturers saw a
large increase in sales in the late 2010s, which many believed was partly attributable
to the use of GPUs in cryptocurrency mining, but the companies either could not or
would not quantify the precise amount. Although that amount is unknown, an analyst
may judge such sales as non-recurring (e.g., due to government restrictions on cryp-
tocurrency mining) and forecast these GPU sales separately from those attributable
to gaming.


Forecast Approaches for Revenues
Any of the four forecast approaches introduced in Exhibit 1 in the prior lesson (histor-
ical results, historical base rates and convergence, management guidance, discretionary
forecasts) can be used for forecasting revenue objects, with the selection based on the
analyst’s judgment, the information environment, and the issuer’s business model. We
illustrate how Elaine Nguyen might use the four approaches to forecast revenues for
Warehouse Club Inc. in Exhibit 2.

                                       Analysts must incorporate their view (implicitly or explicitly) on key risk factors in

                                       changes in the business cycle, inflation and deflation, and technological developments.
                                       For Warehouse Club Inc., two key risk factors are competition and technological

working capital, capital investments, and capital structure. Given the potential wide
range of outcomes, analysts often construct several forecasts for an issuer’s financial

                            3.6%, depending on economic conditions. Iliso’s market share in 2X19 was
                            0.21%, and given past increases, an increase of 2 to 3 bps seems reasonable.

                          2. Explain why an analyst using top-down drivers needs to allocate Iliso’s
                             forecast GMV sales between its own retail sales and sales by third-party
                             merchants. Describe two alternative approaches to doing so.
                            Solution:
                            It is important that an analyst allocate the forecast total GMV between Iliso
                            and third-party merchants, because Iliso’s revenue and cost structure differs
                            for each. Iliso recognizes revenue on a gross basis for its own retail sales
                            and on a net basis for sales made by third-party merchants. Iliso’s take rate
                            is 15% on third-party merchant sales, but its gross margin percentage is far
                            greater.
                            Currently, Iliso’s retail sales account for 85% of its GMV, while third-party
                            merchant sales account for the remaining 15%. An analyst could allocate the
                            forecast increase in GMV sales based on those percentages. Alternatively,
                            an analyst could allocate an increasing proportion to third-party merchant
                            sales, because they have been growing at a faster rate than Iliso’s retail sales.

                          3. Given the following assumptions, the analyst’s forecast of Iliso’s 2X20 total
                             revenues is closest to:

                             ■   National retail sales excluding autos grows by 3.4%.
                             ■   Iliso’s market share (i.e., its GMV as a percentage of national retail
                                 sales excluding autos) increases by 2 bps.
                             ■   GMV is split 75%/25% between retail sales and third-party merchant
                                 sales.
                             ■   The take rate on third-party merchant sales remains the same as in
                                 2X19.

                             A. 7,800.
                             B. 8,441.
                             C. 9,906.
                            Solution:
                            A is correct.
                             Forecast of national retail sales excluding autos = 1.034 × 4,165,000
                             = 4,306,610

                             Forecast of Iliso’s 2X20 GMV = 4,307,000 × (0.21% + 2 bps) = 9,906

                             Forecast of Iliso’s 2X20 retail sales = 9,905 × 75% = 7,430

                             Forecast of 2X20 third-party merchant sales = 9,905 × 25% = 2,477

                             Forecast of 2X20 third-party merchant fees = 2,476 × 15% = 371

                             Forecast of Iliso’s 2X20 total revenues = 7,429 + 371 = 7,801


                          4. An analyst who uses bottom-up drivers forecasts the number of customer
                             accounts to increase by 15%, the average sales per customer to increase by
                             5%, the number of third-party merchants to increase by 28%, and the aver-

      age sales per third-party merchant to increase by 40%. The analyst’s forecast
      for Iliso’s 2X20 GMV (in USD millions) is closest to:
      A. 8,860.
      B. 9,210.
       C. 11,140.
      Solution:
      C is correct.
      Forecast of Iliso’s 2X20 retail sales = 204(1.05) × 36(1.15) = 8,868 or =
      7,336(1.05)(1.15)
      = 8,858

      Forecast of 2X20 third-party merchant sales = [40,500(1.28) ×
      31,300(1.40)]/1,000,000 = 2,272 or = 1,269(1.28)(1.40)
      = 2,274

      Forecast of Iliso’s 2X20 GMV = 8,868 + 2,272 = 11,140




FORECASTING OPERATING EXPENSES AND WORKING
CAPITAL                                                                                       4
              explain approaches to forecasting a company’s operating expenses
              and working capital

Issuers’ disclosures about operating costs are typically less detailed than revenue
disclosures. Rather than modeling costs separately for different geographic regions,
business segments, or product lines, analysts are often forced to use more aggregated
forecast objects such as consolidated financial statement lines (e.g., cost of sales,
SG&A) or summary measures like EBITDA margins on a consolidated or segment
basis. The forecasts for revenues and costs should still be coherent. If sales of a rel-
atively low-margin product, segment, or geography are forecast to grow faster than
other revenues, some level of overall profit margin deterioration should be forecast,
even if the analyst is uncertain about the precise margins earned on each object.
For example, food and grocery typically has low gross profit margins, so an analyst
of a grocery chain that also sells higher-margin items, such as alcoholic products or
pharmaceutical products, would want to forecast any change in product mix sold.


Cost of Sales and Gross Margins
Cost of sales (cost of goods sold, or COGS) is typically the single largest cost for compa-
nies that make and/or sell products. Because it has a direct link with sales, forecasting
this item as a percentage of sales (or as a gross margin) is usually a good approach. If
a company is losing market share to new substitute products with lower prices, gross
margins are likely to decline. But if the company is gaining market share because it
has introduced differentiated products—especially if it has done so in combination
with achieving cost advantages—gross margins are likely to rise.

                              Cost of sales is typically a large cost, so even a single basis point in a gross margin
                          forecast can have a material impact on forecasts of operating profit and free cash
                          flow. Analysts should consider whether a more detailed analysis of these costs (e.g.,
                          by segment, input, or product line, or by volume and price components) is possible to
                          better justify the forecast. For example, some companies face fluctuating input costs
                          that can be passed on to customers only with a time lag. Particularly for companies
                          with low gross margins, sudden shocks in input costs can affect operating profit sig-
                          nificantly. A good example is the sensitivity of airlines’ profits to unhedged changes
                          in jet fuel costs. In these cases, a breakdown of both costs and sales into volume and
                          price components is essential for developing short-term forecasts, even if analysts
                          use the overall relationship between sales and input costs for developing longer-term
                          forecasts, as shown in Exhibit 3.

                           Exhibit 3: The Effect of Prices and Costs on Gross Profit and Margin

                             Assume that a company’s COGS as a percentage of sales equals 25% and that
                             the quantity sold is the same in Period 2 as in Period 1. If input costs double
                             in Period 2 and the company can pass the entire increase on to its customers
                             through a 25% price increase, COGS as a percentage of sales will increase (to
                             40%) because an equal absolute amount has been added to the numerator and
                             to the denominator.

                                                                              Period 1         Period 2

                                   Sales                                       100.0           125.0
                                   COGS                                         25.0             50.0
                                   Gross profit                                 75.0             75.0
                                   COGS as % of sales                           25%              40%
                                   Gross margin %                               75%              60%

                             Thus, although the absolute amount of gross profit will remain constant, the
                             gross margin will decrease (from 75% to 60%).

                              Analysts should incorporate a company’s hedging strategy into a forecast. For
                          example, commodity-driven companies’ gross margins almost automatically decline if
                          input prices of needed commodities increase significantly, because the variable costs
                          increase at a faster rate than output prices. Through hedging strategies, a company
                          can mitigate the impact on profitability. For example, brewers often hedge the cost
                          of barley, a key raw material needed for brewing beer, one year in advance. Although
                          companies usually do not disclose specific hedging positions, their hedging strategy is
                          often disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Further, the negative impact
                          of increasing sales prices on sales volume (if product demand is price elastic) can
                          be mitigated by a policy of gradual sales price increases. For example, if the brewer
                          expects higher barley prices because of a poor harvest, the brewer can slowly increase
                          prices to avoid a strong price jump next year.
                              While competitors’ gross margins can provide a useful cross-check for forecast-
                          ing gross margin, the margins may not be comparable given differences in business
                          models. For example, some retailers own and operate their own stores, whereas other
                          companies operate as wholesalers with franchised retail operations. In the franchise
                          model, most of the operating costs are incurred by the franchisee; the wholesaler sells
                          products with only a small markup to these franchisees. Compared with a retailer
                          with its own stores, a wholesaler will have a much lower gross margin but also much
                          lower operating costs.

SG&A Expenses
SG&A expenses are the other main type of operating costs. In contrast to cost of sales,
SG&A expenses often have a less direct relationship with revenues. As an illustration
of the profit impact of COGS and SG&A, consider the case of a Thai cement and
building materials company, Siam Cement Group, from 2017 to 2018. A summary of
the company’s key income statement items is shown in Exhibit 4.

As shown in Exhibit 4, Siam Cement was affected in 2018 by higher input costs that
could not be fully passed on to customers. Consequently, despite sales growth of 6.1%,
gross profit fell by 6.5% and gross margin declined. The company was able to limit its
other operating costs; SG&A expenses grew 4.8%, declining slightly as a percentage of
revenue. Operating income fell 18.6%. This experience contrasts with the company’s
experience in 2016 (not shown), when lower input costs resulted in a widening of the
gross margin by 240 basis points versus the prior year.
    Although SG&A expenses overall are generally less closely linked to revenue than is
cost of sales, certain SG&A expenses could be more variable than others. Specifically,
selling and distribution expenses often have a large variable component and can be
modeled as a percentage of sales, while general corporate costs are more fixed and
might be better modeled using a fixed growth rate based on expected wage inflation.
    Segment disclosures often include operating and EBITDA margin profitability by
segment, but generally do not include cost items such as cost of sales, SG&A, etc., by
segment. If an analyst is constructing a model based on segment forecasts, the analyst
might instead use summary measures on a segment basis, as shown in Example 1.

                           1. Determine the estimated sales, operating profit, and operating profit margin
                              by using the following two approaches: (A) Assume total sales growth of
                              2.0% and overall underlying operating margin of 19.1% for the next five
                              years, and (B) assume each individual segment’s sales growth and under-
                              lying operating margin continue at the same rate reported in 2019. Which
                              approach will result in a higher estimated underlying operating profit after
                              five years?
                              Solution:
                              Exhibit 6 shows that operating profit after five years will be EUR10,962 mil-
                              lion under Approach A and EUR11,549 million under Approach B.

    2. Compare and explain the results under the two alternative approaches (A
       and B) in Question 1.
        Solution:
        Approach A assumes a constant 2% total sales growth rate and a stable
        19.1% underlying operating margin. Thus, the operating profit growth rate
        is in line with the revenue growth rate and constant at 2%, which therefore
        assumes no difference in growth rates and profitability of the segments.
        Approach B assumes growth rates of 6%, −5%, and 7% of sales for the Beauty
        & Personal Care, Foods & Refreshments, and Home Care segments. This
        approach results in a faster overall compounded growth rate than under
        Approach A (3% versus 2%) and an annual increase, on average, in the total
        underlying operating profit margin of 6 bps due to the mix effect of differ-
        ent segment margins. In 2024E, Approach A yields an underlying operating
        profit margin of 19.1%.

                                   3. Assume the company can grow segment revenues over the next five years at
                                      the following rates: Beauty & Personal Care, 3.0%; Foods & Refreshments,
                                      2.0%; Home Care, 4.0%. But underlying operating profit margins in Beauty
                                      & Personal Care will fall 20 bps annually for the next five years (because
                                      of high competition, limited growth, and costs resulting from the adop-
                                      tion of sustainable packaging), and operating profit margins in the Foods
                                      & Refreshments and Home Care segments will increase by 15 and 50 bps,
                                      respectively, each year for the next five years (helped by increasing demand
                                      for the company’s products and better utilization of its factories). Calculate
                                      the overall underlying operating profit margin in each of the next five years.
                                      Solution:
                                      As shown in Exhibit 7, the overall underlying operating profit margin im-
                                      proves from 19.1% in 2X19 to 19.5% in 2X24, because the margin decline in
                                      Beauty & Personal Care is more than offset by the margin increase in Foods
                                      & Refreshments and the faster-growing Home Care segment.
                                                                                                                                ​

  1. Calculate days sales outstanding (DSO), inventory days on hand (DOH), and
     days payable outstanding (DPO) for years 1, 2, and 3, using year-end balanc-
     es and assuming a 365-day fiscal year.
     Solution:
     Recall that days sales outstanding is equal to accounts receivable/(reve-
     nues/365), inventory days on hand is equal to inventories/(COGS/365), and
     days payable outstanding is equal to accounts payable/(COGS/365). Using
     the data in Exhibit 8, the three ratios for years 1–3 are as follows:

                             3. Liang forecasts that days sales outstanding, inventory days on hand, and
                                days payable outstanding in years 4, 5, and 6 will remain the same as the
                                year 3 amounts. Using Liang’s forecasts as well as forecast revenue and
                                COGS, calculate expected accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts
                                payable year-end balances for years 4, 5, and 6.
                                Solution:
                                Each of the efficiency ratios can be rearranged to yield working capital
                                balances, because we have values for two of the three variables in them: the
                                efficiency ratios are assumed to remain constant from year 3 levels, and
                                revenue and COGS have already been forecast.
                                Days sales outstanding is equal to accounts receivable/(revenues/365); thus,
                                accounts receivable is equal to days sales outstanding × (revenues/365).
                                Similarly, inventories is equal to inventory days on hand × (COGS/365), and
                                accounts payable is equal to days payable outstanding × (COGS/365).
                                Using the data in Exhibit 8 and the revenue and COGS forecasts, year-end
                                working capital account balances are as follows:
                                                                           ​

Gross margin (on net sales)             Historical results         From 2X10 to 2X19, Warehouse’s gross margin increased by

                                     QUESTION SET

                                      Iliso Marketplace Ltd., the e-commerce retailer introduced in prior
                                      modules, reports its GMV by product category: in 2X19, the mix was
                                      55% food and grocery, 20% media and electronics, 8% home goods and décor,
                                      and 17% apparel and beauty products. However, Iliso presents only aggregated
                                      financial results (no segment disclosures).
                                          Iliso’s cost of revenue is primarily composed of the inventory costs of products
                                      sold to customers where Iliso records revenue gross. Inventory costs include
                                      shipping and handling costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes outbound
                                      shipping and logistics-related expenses, as well as delivery service costs from
                                      the third-party merchant business, where Iliso is the delivery service provider.
                                      Cost of revenue also includes depreciation expense related to inventory handling
                                      and shipping assets.
                                          Iliso’s operating, general, and administrative expenses include costs incurred
                                      in operating and staffing its fulfillment centers, customer service costs, payment
                                      processing fees, costs related to the design, execution, and maintenance of Iliso’s
                                      technology infrastructure, and general corporate function costs.
                                          Iliso has minimal accounts receivable, because customers pay with credit cards
                                      that settle in less than a week. Iliso does have significant inventory, accounts
                                      payable, and accrued expenses on its balance sheet.

                                      1. How might an analyst use Iliso’s disclosure of GMV by product category?
                                         Solution:
                                         An analyst could estimate cost of sales/sales and gross profit margin by cat-
                                         egory by looking at other retailers that primarily sell products in the specific
                                         category. Information on those companies could be used to check whether
                                         Iliso’s gross profit margin is consistent with that implied by the product cat-
                                         egory mix. Also, if the mix is expected to change, an analyst can adjust the
                                         aggregate cost of sales/sales and gross profit margins accordingly. The infor-

      mation should probably not be used directly to develop detailed forecasts by
      category, because those forecasts would not be verifiable and would not be
      an efficient use of the analyst’s time.

   2. It is most appropriate to forecast Iliso’s cost of revenue as a percentage of its:
      A. retail sales.
      B. total revenues.
       C. total GMV sales.
      Solution:
      A is correct. Cost of revenue should be based on Iliso’s retail sales. Cost of
      revenue is unaffected by third-party merchandise sales unless the merchant
      uses Iliso’s fulfillment network for warehousing and delivery. The company
      does not provide information on such use by third parties, and it would be
      a small cost compared with cost of revenue for Iliso’s retail sales. Iliso’s cost
      of revenue is primarily composed of the inventory costs of products sold to
      customers where Iliso records revenue gross.

   3. Discuss the use of a historical base rates and convergence approach, calcu-
      lated using other retailers’ financial results, for forecasting Iliso’s operating
      expenses.
      Solution:
      Iliso’s e-commerce business model and the breadth of the retail sales indus-
      try may make industry averages inappropriate to use for Iliso. However, if
      there are larger, more mature e-commerce retailers to calculate statistics for,
      this approach may be appropriate.

   4. If food and grocery increases as a proportion of Iliso’s retail sales, which of
      the following would most likely increase?
      A. Inventory turnover
      B. Gross profit margin
       C. Current assets/sales
      Solution:
      A is correct. Inventory turnover would increase because of the perishable
      nature of food and grocery. Inventory as a percentage of sales would de-
      crease, resulting in a decrease in current assets to sales.

                          amortization expenses. Capital expenditures can be broken down into maintenance
                          capital expenditures necessary to sustain the current business and growth capital
                          expenditures needed to expand the business. Maintenance capital expenditure forecasts
                          are often based on historical depreciation and amortization expenses, usually with
                          a small adjustment upward to account for inflation in capital goods. For businesses
                          with low fixed asset turnover, maintenance capital expenditure requirements can be
                          quite high. Growth capital expenditure forecasts are more discretionary and are tied
                          to management’s expansion plans and revenue growth. Depreciation and amortization
                          forecasts are based on net PP&E and intangibles on the balance sheet (which increase
                          due to capital expenditures) and their useful lives as assumed by management’s
                          accounting policies, which can be approximated by the ratio of gross fixed assets to
                          depreciation and amortization expenses. Information may also be found in the notes
                          to the financial statements.
                              Analysts must also make projections about a company’s future capital structure.
                          Leverage ratios—such as debt to capital, debt to equity, and debt to EBITDA—are often
                          used as the forecast object to project future debt and equity levels. Analysts should
                          consider historical company practice, management’s financial strategy, and the capital
                          requirements implied by the capital expenditure assumptions when projecting the
                          future capital structure. Management may provide guidance on target capital structure,
                          debt covenant ratios (e.g., net debt to EBITDA), and capital expenditures, sometimes
                          broken down into maintenance, growth, and acquisitions. Example 3 demonstrates
                          the use of these forecast objects for YY Ltd., the same company in Example 2.

   2. Given the following assumptions and forecast revenue from Example 2,
      calculate expected total fixed assets for years 4–6.

       ■    Capital expenditures for PP&E as a percentage of revenue to remain at
            the year 3 level
       ■    Capital expenditures for intangibles as a percentage of revenue to
            remain at the year 1 level
       ■    Goodwill to remain at the year 3 level
       ■    Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of beginning-
            of-year PP&E, net, and intangible assets, net, to remain at year 3 levels
      Solution:
      Using the data provided, expected total fixed assets for years 4–6 was calcu-
      lated as CNY12,351 million; CNY15,179 million; and CNY18,662 million,
      respectively. PP&E, net, for each year was calculated as the prior period
      balance plus capital expenditures minus depreciation expense. Intangible
      assets, net, for each year was calculated in a similar fashion. Goodwill was
      held constant at CNY253 million.

                            YY Ltd. management has a year 6 gross debt to EBITDA ratio target of 2.0.

                             A. Assuming an EBITDA margin of 6.0%, revenue forecasts from
                                Example 2, and gross debt to EBITDA ratios of 1.25, 1.50, and 2.0 for
                                years 4, 5, and 6, respectively, calculate expected gross debt for years
                                4–6.
                             B. Given the results of part A, how much incremental borrowing does
                                the forecast imply from year 3 to year 6?
                            Solution:
                            Gross debt of CNY21,579 million; CNY30,289 million; and CNY45,635
                            million are estimated for years 4–6, respectively, for YY Ltd. This forecast is
                            made by first multiplying forecast revenue by the forecast EBITDA margin
                            to calculate forecast EBITDA. Then, the expected gross debt to EBITDA
                            ratio is multiplied by the forecast EBITDA to calculate forecast gross debt.

   1. Which of the following would the analyst most likely use in estimating Iliso’s
      maintenance capital expenditures?
      A. Operating income
      B. Depreciation expense
       C. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
          (EBITDA)
      Solution:
      B is correct. Depreciation expense can serve as the basis for maintenance
      capital expenditures, as it is management’s estimate of the cost of fixed as-
      sets expensed on the income statement in a manner that tracks its use.

   2. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate for forecasting Iliso’s
      capital expenditures?
      A. Historical results
      B. Analyst’s discretionary forecast
       C. Historical base rates and convergence
      Solution:
      A is correct. Capital expenditures have been 4.1% of retail sales for the past
      four years (2X16–2X19). The historical results approach—using the bot-
      tom-up driver retail sales—is most appropriate. An analyst’s discretionary
      forecast is not required, because Iliso is not in a cyclical industry or under-
      going a fundamental change. Iliso’s unique model and the breadth of the
      industry make the approach using historical base rates and convergence to
      the industry inappropriate.

   3. The analyst forecasts 2X20 total revenues of 8,411 million, operating income
      of 2% of total revenues, capital expenditures of 4% of total revenues, depre-
      ciation expense of 20% of opening PP&E (net), and debt/EBITDA of 0.50.
      The analyst’s forecast for debt (in millions) is closest to:
      A. 84.
      B. 161.

                                 C. 195.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct.
                                2X20 operating income = 0.02(8,411) = 168

                                2X20 depreciation expense = 0.20(768) = 154

                                EBITDA = 168 + 154 = 322

                                Debt = 0.50(322) = 161


                             4. The analyst notes that Iliso’s common stock and paid-in capital accounts
                                increased, in total, by 75 million from 2X18 to 2X19, but only 42 million was
                                reported as stock issuance on the statement of cash flows. Retained earnings
                                increased by the amount of net income. Which of the following most likely
                                explains the difference of 33 million?
                                A. A stock split
                                B. A stock dividend
                                 C. Stock-based compensation
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense in the income
                                statement and is reported as an addition to net income in the indirect
                                method of reporting cash flow from operations. The issuance also increases
                                common stock and paid-in capital. A stock split typically simply increases
                                the number of shares outstanding and decreases any stated par value per
                                share. A stock dividend increases common stock and paid-in capital and
                                reduces retained earnings by the same amount.




              6           SCENARIO ANALYSIS

                                        describe the use of scenario analysis in forecasting

                          Recall from earlier lessons that industry and business risks may result in future out-
                          comes that differ from expectations. The final step in forecasting involves incorporating
                          the possibility of different outcomes based on key risk factors as well as judging their
                          likelihood of occurrence. Generic risk factors that affect all companies—but to varying
                          degrees—include changes in the business cycle, competition, inflation and deflation,
                          and technological developments. Rather than develop single point estimate forecasts,
                          analysts make several forecast scenarios that vary based on different outcomes with
                          respect to key risk factors. Investors compare these scenarios with other analysts’
                          (e.g., sell-side analysts) forecasts for a company, as well as forecasts implied by current
                          valuations, to make investment decisions.
                              We demonstrate the use of scenario analysis for technological developments that
                          threaten to cannibalize demand for an existing product in the following historical case
                          study. Technological developments can affect demand for a product, the quantity sup-
                          plied of a product, or both. When changes in technology lead to lower manufacturing

costs, the supply curve will shift to the right as suppliers produce more of the product
at the same price. Conversely, if changes in technology result in the development of
attractive substitute products, the demand curve will shift to the left.

EXAMPLE 4

   Quantifying the Tablet Market’s Potential to Cannibalize
   Demand for Personal Computers
   The worldwide tablet market experienced a major technological development
   with the introduction of the Apple iPad tablet in April 2010, which was expected
   to have (and indeed did have) important implications for the manufacturers of
   desktop and laptop computers. A tablet promised to offer the capabilities of a
   portable personal computer (PC) with a touchscreen interface instead of a key-
   board. Another distinguishing feature of the then-new tablets was that—unlike
   the majority of PCs, which run on the Microsoft Windows platform—they would
   run on a non-Microsoft operating system: Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android.
   Given the tablet’s ability to perform many of the most common tasks of a PC—
   including emailing, browsing the web, sharing photos, playing music, watching
   movies, playing games, keeping a calendar, and managing contacts—an analyst
   at that time might reasonably have wondered to what extent sales of tablets
   might cannibalize demand for PCs and what the potential impact might be on
   Microsoft’s sales and earnings. Exhibit 13 presents one approach to answering
   these questions. It is set at the start of 2012, just over a year after the launch of
   the iPad. It is presented from the position of an analyst assessing the impact of
   the tablet on the PC market and Microsoft.

                          Sources: Based on data from Gartner, JPMorgan, Microsoft, and authors’ analysis.
                              Worldwide market shipments of PCs in FY2011 totaled 350.9 million units,
                          while worldwide shipments of tablets totaled 38.5 million units (source: Gartner
                          Personal Computer Quarterly Statistics Worldwide Database). Shipments to
                          consumers represented 96% of total tablet shipments during fiscal year 2011. We
                          next estimate the magnitude of the potential substitution effect, or cannibaliza-
                          tion factor, that tablets will have on the PC market. Because the cannibalization
                          factor depends on many different variables—including user preferences, end-use
                          application, and whether the purchaser already owns a PC—we use a range of
                          potential estimates. Moreover, we also divide the worldwide PC market into
                          consumer and non-consumer (enterprise, education, and government purchas-
                          ers), because the degree of substitution is likely to differ between the two. For
                          purposes of illustration, we assume a cannibalization factor of 30% for the con-
                          sumer market and 10% for the non-consumer market in our base case scenario.
Scenario Analysis                                                                        321


       In addition, the base case scenario assumes that non-consumer adoption of
   tablets increases to 15% of the market from 4% in 2011. Moreover, although the
   composition of the global PC market is roughly evenly divided between con-
   sumers and non-consumers (48% and 52% in fiscal year 2011, respectively), the
   non-consumer segment is significantly more profitable for Microsoft, because
   approximately 80% of the company’s Office products are sold to enterprise, edu-
   cation, and government institutions. The average selling price (ASP) estimates
   are derived by dividing Microsoft’s estimated average revenue by customer type
   for the prior three years by Microsoft’s estimated PC shipments for each type
   of customer. By multiplying the projected number of PCs cannibalized by tab-
   lets by the estimated ASP, we can derive an estimate of the revenue impact for
   Microsoft. For example, in FY2012, it is projected that 24.8 million consumer
   PCs will be cannibalized by sales of tablets. With a consumer ASP of USD85,
   this cannibalization implies a revenue loss for Microsoft of USD2.1 billion (24.8
   million units × USD85 per unit = USD2.1 billion).
       Once the revenue impact has been projected, the next step is to estimate the
   impact of lower PC unit volumes on operating costs and margins. We begin by
   analyzing the cost structure of Microsoft and, more specifically, the breakdown
   between fixed and variable costs. Most software companies have a cost structure
   with a relatively high proportion of fixed costs and a low proportion of variable
   costs, because costs related to product development and marketing (mostly
   fixed) are sunk and unrecoverable, whereas the cost of producing an additional
   copy of the software (mostly variable) is relatively low. Because very few, if any,
   companies provide an explicit breakdown of fixed versus variable costs, an
   estimate almost always needs to be made. One method is to use the formula
      %∆ (Cost of revenue + Operating expenses)/%∆ revenue,
      where %∆ is “percentage change in,” used as a proxy for variable cost per-
   centage. Another approach is to assign an estimate of the percentage of fixed
   and variable costs to the various components of operating expenses. The two
   approaches are illustrated in Exhibit 14 and Exhibit 15.

                                            As can be seen, Microsoft’s cost structure appears to consist of approximately
                                        70% fixed costs and 30% variable costs. Note, however, that a growing company
                                        like Microsoft will typically re-invest in PP&E to support future growth, so even
                                        those expenses that appear to be “fixed” will increase over time. To adjust for
                                        this expected growth in fixed costs, this example includes an assumption that
                                        the change in fixed costs will be half the rate of the change in sales. Variable
                                        costs are projected to change at the same rate as sales. As shown in Exhibit 16,
                                        after incorporating these assumptions into the projections, an assumed 7.0%
                                        compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue through FY2014 would trans-
                                        late into a 10.6% CAGR in operating income [(36,757/27,161)1/3 − 1 = 0.106,
                                        or 10.6%]. In addition, these assumptions would result in an operating margin
                                        expansion of 410 bps over the same period (42.9% − 38.8% = 4.1 pps, or 410 bps),
                                        because of the significant amount of operating leverage that exists as a result of

   a relatively large fixed cost base. With the further assumptions of no change in
   other income, a constant effective tax rate, and no change in shares outstanding,
   the pre-cannibalization model, shown in Exhibit 16, results in projected revenue
   of USD85.7 billion, operating income of USD36.8 billion, an operating margin
   of 42.9%, and EPS that increases at a CAGR of 10.3% to USD3.62 in FY2014.

        In the post-cannibalization scenario, as shown in Exhibit 17, revenue is
   reduced each year to reflect the expected impact of cannibalization, which
   results in a decrease in the CAGR of revenue over the period to 5.2%, down
   from 7.0% in the pre-cannibalization scenario. Given the reduction in revenue
   growth and holding the cost structure constant at 70/30 fixed versus variable
   costs, operating income growth slows to a CAGR of 8.0%, down from 10.6% in
   the pre-cannibalization scenario. Operating margin at the end of the period is
   reduced by approximately 100 bps, from 42.9% to 41.9%, because the company
   is unable to leverage its fixed cost base to the same degree as a result of slower
   revenue growth. Overall, in the post-cannibalization scenario, Microsoft is

                                       Answer the following questions using the data from the exhibits on
                                       Microsoft:

                                       1. Estimate post-cannibalization global PC shipments in FY2012 assuming a
                                          cannibalization factor of 40% for consumers and 15% for non-consumers.
                                         Solution:
                                         The number of PCs cannibalized by tablets is equal to the product of the
                                         expected number of global tablet shipments, the percentage representation
                                         of each category, and the cannibalization factor for the category. Tablet
Scenario Analysis                                                                         325


      shipments in FY2012 are projected to be 90 million units; (90 million tablets
      × 92% consumer representation × 40% consumer cannibalization factor =
      33.12 million consumer PCs cannibalized by tablets) + (90 million tablets
      × 8% non-consumer representation × 15% cannibalization = 1.08 million
      non-consumer PCs cannibalized by tablets) = 34.2 million total PCs canni-
      balized by tablets. Post-cannibalization shipments are equal to pre-canni-
      balization shipments minus expected cannibalization, or 360 million − 34.2
      million = 325.8 million.

   2. Using the results derived in Question 1, estimate the post-cannibalization
      revenue in FY2012 for Microsoft.
      Solution:
      The estimated impact on revenue is equal to the product of the number of
      PCs cannibalized and the ASP. Using the results obtained in Question 1 and
      the ASP data, the expected revenue impact can be calculated as (33.12 mil-
      lion consumer PCs cannibalized by tablets × USD85 ASP = USD2.815 bil-
      lion) + (1.08 million non-consumer PCs cannibalized by tablets × USD155
      ASP = USD167.4 million) = USD2.983 billion total impact on revenue for
      Microsoft. Post-cannibalization revenue is equal to pre-cannibalization
      revenue minus the estimated impact of cannibalization on revenue, or
      USD74.839 billion − USD2.983 billion = USD71.856 billion.

   3. Using the estimate for post-cannibalization revenue derived in Question 2
      and the cost structure provided, estimate post-cannibalization operating
      income and operating margin in FY2012 for Microsoft. Assume that fixed
      costs change at half the rate of the change in sales.

    Whenever one is estimating something that depends on many different variables
that are difficult to measure, we recommend altering some of the assumptions to
generate a range of estimates based on various scenarios. Thus, having developed a
forecast under a base case cannibalization scenario, we can analyze the sensitivity of
the results by altering the cannibalization assumptions. The base case scenario cor-
responds to the assumptions reflected in the boxed center of the table in Exhibit 20.
Exhibit 21 summarizes the results of both bull and bear case scenarios, showing the
estimated FY2014 EPS under alternative estimated cannibalization factors.

QUESTION SET


   1. For which of the following companies is it most crucial for an
      analyst to conduct scenario analysis to estimate a decline in earnings from a
      recession?
       A. A bank
       B. A chain of large grocery stores
       C. A provider of residential electricity
      Solution:
      A is correct, because both lending volume and interest rates typically fall
      in recessions, which results in declining earnings for banks. Demand for
      both food-at-home and residential electricity is generally not as sensitive to
      changes in the business cycle.

   2. An analyst is preparing scenarios for a company’s gross margin. Selected
      financial data from the prior period include the following:
       Average selling price per product EUR6.50

       Quantity sold (000s) 2,300

       Total revenues (EUR 000s) 14,950

       Cost of sales (EUR 000s) 7,475

       Gross profit (EUR 000s) 7,475

       Gross profit margin 50%


      If input prices increase by 20%, the analyst expects the company to increase
      selling prices by 10%, resulting in a 5% decrease in volume sold. The forecast
      decrease in gross profit margin is closest to:
       A. 4.5%
       B. 7.4%.

                             C. 15.0%
                            Solution:
                            A is correct.
                             Average selling price = EUR6.50(1.10) = EUR7.15

                             Quantity sold in 000s = 2,300(0.95) = 2,185

                             Average input cost = (7,475/2,300)(1.20) = EUR3.90

                             Total revenues in 000s = 2,185(EUR7.15) = 15,622.75

                             Gross profit in 000s = 2,185(EUR7.15 − EUR3.90) = 7,101.25

                             Gross profit margin
                             = 7,101.25/15,622.75 ≈ 45.5%, which is 4.5% less than 50%


                          3. The invention of a new technology that leads to lower product manufactur-
                             ing costs in a highly competitive industry is most likely to result in:
                             A. lower gross profit margins.
                             B. higher gross profit margins.
                             C. no impact on gross profit margins.
                            Solution:
                            C is correct. In a highly competitive industry, savings in manufacturing costs
                            are likely to be passed on to customers through competition in the form of
                            lower prices.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                          1. Forecast objects should be:
                             A. based on independent third-party reports.

                             B. based on individual discrete items, not aggregations.

                             C. disclosed regularly or based on items that are disclosed regularly.

                          2. Management guidance is most appropriately used by analysts in forecasting:
                             A. capital expenditures of a company.

                             B. pricing of commodities sold by a company.

                             C. revenue of a company sensitive to the business cycle.

                          3. Which of the following is an example of a top-down driver of revenues for a
                             passenger airline?
                             A. Market share of routes

                             B. Number of planes in fleet

                             C. Average ticket price per mile flown

                          4. An analyst forecasts a company’s sales using a historical results approach and
                             top-down drivers (expected industry sales and expected market share). The
                             analyst observes that the forecast is within the range of management guidance on
                             sales but is toward the upper end and not closer to the midpoint. Which of the
                             following is the most likely explanation for this observation?
                             A. The analyst has been overly optimistic in estimating the company’s expected
                                market share.

                             B. Management’s true expectations are toward the upper end, but manage-
                                ment has created a range using a pessimistic lower bound that is more easily
                                cleared.

                             C. The midpoint represents management’s true expectations, and management
                                has a lower and better estimate of market growth based on macroeconomic

   A. analyst discretion to forecast all operating costs.

   B. management guidance to forecast all operating costs.

   C. management guidance to forecast fixed operating costs and analyst discre-

7. An analyst notes that a company’s capital expenditures do not follow a discern-
   ible pattern; the company seems to have periods of very low capital expenditures
   and periods of high capital expenditures. Management does not provide any
   guidance on capital expenditures. The analyst should develop a forecast of capital
   expenditures based on:
   A. the company’s usage of PP&E capacity.

   B. the industry’s average capital expenditures.

   C. the company’s average capital expenditures.

8. An analyst predicts that if a company’s technological developments are a success,
   the company’s operating costs will be reduced by 15%. As a result of the reduc-
   tion in costs, the company will reduce the average selling price of its products
   by 5% and the volume of sales will increase by 8%. The company’s current gross
   profit margin is 40%. If technological developments occur, the company’s gross
   profit margin will be closest to:
   A. 44.8%.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. C is correct. Forecast objects should either be disclosed regularly or be directly
                             calculable using what is disclosed regularly. Information that is not disclosed reg-
                             ularly (such as a third-party consultancy’s report) is suitable to inform forecasts
                             but can be problematic for direct use, because forecasts cannot be confirmed in
                             a timely manner. While it may be intuitive to forecast individual discrete items,
                             such as sales and gross margin by individual product line, if gross margin is dis-
                             closed only on a consolidated basis, it will be difficult for analysts to verify their
                             product-line gross margin estimates.

                          2. A is correct. Management has an advantage at the firm level and tends to make
                             more accurate forecasts for objects that are subject to management actions, such
                             as capital expenditures. Management does not have an informational advantage
                             over investors in forecasting macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, the business
                             cycle, or the prices of commodities. Hutton et al. (2012) found that investors have
                             an informational advantage over management at the macroeconomic level.

                          3. A is correct. Market share of routes is a top-down driver of revenues and can be
                             used to estimate an airline’s market share. The number of planes in fleet and the
                             average ticket price per mile flown are bottom-up drivers of revenues.

                          4. B is correct. Management has a tendency to pad its guidance to make it easier to
                             achieve the forecast results for which management will be rewarded. Manage-
                             ment does not have an informational advantage at the macroeconomic level.

                          5. A is correct. Historical results is least appropriate, because the company has
                             changed its competitive strategy. Analyst’s discretionary forecast may be appro-
                             priate, because the company is undergoing a fundamental change. The company
                             is growing and may be transitioning to be more like the industry, in which case
                             historical base rates and convergence may be an appropriate approach.

                          6. C is correct. Management has an advantage in forecasting for objects that are
                             subject to its actions (such as capital expenditures and inventories, which affect
                             fixed costs). The analyst is likely to have an informational advantage when it
                             comes to forecasting economic conditions and commodity prices, which affect
                             revenues and variable costs.

                          7. A is correct. Based on the company’s spending pattern, it most likely makes
                             capital expenditures based on capacity needs as it grows. If it is approaching full
                             usage of existing capacity, it will expand.

                          8. B is correct.
                             Sales = 100(0.95)(1.08) = 102.6

                             Cost of sales = 60(0.85)(1.08) = 55.1

                             Gross profit = 102.2 − 55.1 = 47.5

                             Gross profit margin = 47.5/102.6 = 46.3%

              1           INTRODUCTION
                          Analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions, including
                          buy and sell recommendations. What information is gathered and how it is processed
                          depend on the analyst and the purpose of the analysis. Technical analysis uses such
                          information as stock price and trading volume as the basis for investment decisions.
                          Fundamental analysis uses information about the economy, industry, and company
                          as the basis for investment decisions. Examples of fundamentals are unemployment
                          rates, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, industry growth, and quality of and
                          growth in company earnings. Whereas technical analysts use information to predict
                          price movements and base investment decisions on the direction of predicted change
                          in prices, fundamental analysts use information to estimate the value of a security
                          and to compare the estimated value to the market price and then base investment
                          decisions on that comparison.
                              This reading introduces equity valuation models used to estimate the intrinsic value
                          (synonym: fundamental value) of a security; intrinsic value is based on an analysis
                          of investment fundamentals and characteristics. The fundamentals to be considered
                          depend on the analyst’s approach to valuation. In a top-down approach, an analyst
                          examines the economic environment, identifies sectors that are expected to prosper
                          in that environment, and analyzes securities of companies from previously identified
                          attractive sectors. In a bottom-up approach, an analyst typically follows an industry or
                          industries and forecasts fundamentals for the companies in those industries in order
                          to determine valuation. Whatever the approach, an analyst who estimates the intrinsic
                          value of an equity security is implicitly questioning the accuracy of the market price
                          as an estimate of value. Valuation is particularly important in active equity portfolio
                          management, which aims to improve on the return–risk trade-off of a portfolio’s
                          benchmark by identifying mispriced securities.
                              This reading is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the implications of dif-
                          ferences between estimated value and market price. Section 3 introduces three major
                          categories of valuation model. Section 4 presents an overview of present value models
                          with a focus on the dividend discount model. Section 5 describes and examines the
                          use of multiples in valuation. Section 6 explains asset-based valuation and demon-
                          strates how these models can be used to estimate value. Section 7 states conclusions
                          and summarizes the reading.




              2           ESTIMATED VALUE AND MARKET PRICE

                                        evaluate whether a security, given its current market price and a
                                        value estimate, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued by the
                                        market

                          By comparing estimates of value and market price, an analyst can arrive at one of
                          three conclusions: The security is undervalued, overvalued, or fairly valued in the
                          marketplace. For example, if the market price of an asset is $10 and the analyst esti-
                          mates intrinsic value at $10, a logical conclusion is that the security is fairly valued.
                          If the security is selling for $20, the security would be considered overvalued. If the
                          security is selling for $5, the security would be considered undervalued. Basically, by
                          estimating value, the analyst is assuming that the market price is not necessarily the
                          best estimate of intrinsic value. If the estimated value exceeds the market price, the
Estimated Value and Market Price                                                               337


analyst infers the security is undervalued. If the estimated value equals the market
price, the analyst infers the security is fairly valued. If the estimated value is less than
the market price, the analyst infers the security is overvalued.
    In practice, the conclusion is not so straightforward. Analysts must cope with
uncertainties related to model appropriateness and the correct value of inputs. An
analyst’s final conclusion depends not only on the comparison of the estimated value
and the market price but also on the analyst’s confidence in the estimated value (i.e.,
in the model selected and the inputs used in it). One can envision a spectrum running
from relatively high confidence in the valuation model and the inputs to relatively
low confidence in the valuation model and/or the inputs. When confidence is rela-
tively low, the analyst might demand a substantial divergence between his or her own
value estimate and the market price before acting on an apparent mispricing. For
instance, if the estimate of intrinsic value is $10 and the market price is $10.05, the
analyst might reasonably conclude that the security is fairly valued and that the 1/2
of 1 percent market price difference from the estimated value is within the analyst’s
confidence interval.
    Confidence in the convergence of the market price to the intrinsic value over the
investment time horizon relevant to the objectives of the portfolio must also be taken
into account before an analyst acts on an apparent mispricing or makes a buy, sell,
or hold recommendation: The ability to benefit from identifying a mispriced security
depends on the market price converging to the estimated intrinsic value.
    In seeking to identify mispricing and attractive investments, analysts are treating
market prices with skepticism, but they are also treating market prices with respect. For
example, an analyst who finds that many securities examined appear to be overvalued
will typically recheck models and inputs before acting on a conclusion of overvalu-
ation. Analysts also often recognize and factor into recommendations that different
market segments—such as securities closely followed by analysts versus securities
relatively neglected by analysts—may differ in how common or persistent mispricing
is. Mispricing may be more likely in securities neglected by analysts.

EXAMPLE 1

   Valuation and Analyst Response

   1. An analyst finds that all the securities analyzed have estimated values higher
      than their market prices. The securities all appear to be:
       A. overvalued.
       B. undervalued.
       C. fairly valued.
   Solution to 1:
      B is correct. The estimated intrinsic value for each security is greater than
      the market price. The securities all appear to be undervalued in the market.
      Note, however, that the analyst may wish to reexamine the model and inputs
      to check that the conclusion is valid.

   2. An analyst finds that nearly all companies in a market segment have com-
      mon shares which are trading at market prices above the analyst’s estimate
      of the shares’ values. This market segment is widely followed by analysts.
      Which of the following statements describes the analyst’s most appropriate
      first action?
       A. Issue a sell recommendation for each share issue.
338   Learning Module 8                                                   Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools


                                 B. Issue a buy recommendation for each share issue.
                                 C. Reexamine the models and inputs used for the valuations.
                            Solution to 2:
                                 C is correct. It seems improbable that all the share issues analyzed are over-
                                 valued, as indicated by market prices in excess of estimated value—partic-
                                 ularly because the market segment is widely followed by analysts. Thus, the
                                 analyst will not issue a sell recommendation for each issue. The analyst will
                                 most appropriately reexamine the models and inputs prior to issuing any
                                 recommendations. A buy recommendation is not an appropriate response
                                 to an overvalued security.

                            3. An analyst, using a number of models and a range of inputs, estimates a se-
                               curity’s value to be between ¥250 and ¥270. The security is trading at ¥265.
                               The security appears to be:
                                 A. overvalued.
                                 B. undervalued.
                                 C. fairly valued.
                            Solution to 3:
                                 C is correct. The security’s market price of ¥265 is within the range estimat-
                                 ed by the analyst. The security appears to be fairly valued.

                              Analysts often use a variety of models and inputs to achieve greater confidence
                          in their estimates of intrinsic value. The use of more than one model and a range of
                          inputs also helps the analyst understand the sensitivity of value estimates to different
                          models and inputs.




              3           CATEGORIES OF EQUITY VALUATION MODELS

                                         describe major categories of equity valuation models

                          Three major categories of equity valuation models are as follows:
                             ■    Present value models (synonym: discounted cash flow models). These
                                  models estimate the intrinsic value of a security as the present value of the
                                  future benefits expected to be received from the security. In present value
                                  models, benefits are often defined in terms of cash expected to be distrib-
                                  uted to shareholders (dividend discount models) or in terms of cash flows
                                  available to be distributed to shareholders after meeting capital expendi-
                                  ture and working capital needs (free-cash-flow-to-equity models). Many
                                  models fall within this category, ranging from the relatively simple to the
                                  very complex. In Section 4, we discuss in detail two of the simpler models,
                                  the Gordon (constant) growth model and the two-stage dividend discount

                             ■    Multiplier models (synonym: market multiple models). These models are
                                  based chiefly on share price multiples or enterprise value multiples. The
                                  former model estimates intrinsic value of a common share from a price mul-
                                  tiple for some fundamental variable, such as revenues, earnings, cash flows,

         or book value. Examples of the multiples include price to earnings (P/E,
         share price divided by earnings per share) and price to sales (P/S, share price
         divided by sales per share). The fundamental variable may be stated on a
         forward basis (e.g., forecasted EPS for the next year) or a trailing basis (e.g.,
         EPS for the past year), as long as the usage is consistent across companies
         being examined. Price multiples are also used to compare relative values.
         The use of the ratio of share price to EPS—that is, the P/E multiple—to
         judge relative value is an example of this approach to equity valuation.
         Enterprise value (EV) multiples have the form (Enterprise value)/(Value of
         a fundamental variable). Two possible choices for the denominator are earn-
         ings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and
         total revenue. Enterprise value, the numerator, is a measure of a company’s
         total market value from which cash and short-term investments have been
         subtracted (because an acquirer could use those assets to pay for acquiring
         the company). An estimate of common share value can be calculated indi-
         rectly from the EV multiple; the value of liabilities and preferred shares can
         be subtracted from the EV to arrive at the value of common equity.
    ■    Asset-based valuation models. These models estimate intrinsic value of
         a common share from the estimated value of the assets of a corporation
         minus the estimated value of its liabilities and preferred shares. The esti-
         mated market value of the assets is often determined by making adjustments
         to the book value (synonym: carrying value) of assets and liabilities. The
         theory underlying the asset-based approach is that the value of a business is
         equal to the sum of the value of the business’s assets.
    As already mentioned, many analysts use more than one type of model to esti-
mate value. Analysts recognize that each model is a simplification of the real world
and that there are uncertainties related to model appropriateness and the inputs to
the models. The choice of model(s) will depend on the availability of information to
input into the model(s) and the analyst’s confidence in the information and in the
appropriateness of the model(s).

EXAMPLE 2

   Categories of Equity Valuation Models

   1. An analyst is estimating the intrinsic value of a new company. The analyst
      has one year of financial statements for the company and has calculated the
      average values of a variety of price multiples for the industry in which the
      company operates. The analyst plans to use at least one model from each of
      the three categories of valuation models. The analyst is least likely to rely on
      the estimate(s) from the:
        A. multiplier model(s).
        B. present value model(s).
        C. asset-based valuation model(s).
   Solution to 1:
        B is correct. Because the company has only one year of data available, the
        analyst is least likely to be confident in the inputs for a present value model.
        The values on the balance sheet, even before adjustment, are likely to be
        close to market values because the assets are all relatively new. The multipli-
        er models are based on average multiples from the industry.

                            2. Based on a company’s EPS of €1.35, an analyst estimates the intrinsic value
                               of a security to be €16.60. Which type of model is the analyst most likely to
                               be using to estimate intrinsic value?

                            Solution to 2:
                               A is correct. The analyst is using a multiplier model based on the P/E multi-
                               ple. The P/E multiple used was 16.60/1.35 = 12.3.

                             As you begin the study of specific equity valuation models in the next section, you
                          must bear in mind that any model of value is, by necessity, a simplification of the real
                          world. Never forget this simple fact! You may encounter models much more complicated
                          than the ones discussed here, but even those models will be simplifications of reality.

                                        stock splits, reverse stock splits, and share repurchases
                                        describe dividend payment chronology


                          Present value models follow a fundamental tenet of economics which states that
                          individuals defer consumption—that is, they invest—for the future benefits expected.
                          Individuals and companies make an investment because they expect thereby to earn a
                          rate of return over the investment period. Logically, the value of an investment should
                          be equal to the present value of the expected future benefits. For common shares,
                          an analyst can equate benefits to the cash flows to be generated by the investment.
                          The simplest present value model of equity valuation is the dividend discount model
                          (DDM), which specifies cash flows from a common stock investment to be dividends.
                              The next section describes aspects of dividends that users of dividend discount
                          models should understand.


                          Dividends: Background for the Dividend Discount Model
                          Generally, there are two sources of return from investing in equities: (1) cash divi-
                          dends received by an investor over his or her holding period and (2) the change in
                          the market price of equities over that holding period.
                               A dividend is a distribution paid to shareholders based on the number of shares
                          owned, and a cash dividend is a cash distribution made to a company’s shareholders.
                          Cash dividends are typically paid out regularly at known intervals; such dividends are
                          known as regular cash dividends. By contrast, an extra dividend or special dividend
                          is a dividend paid by a company that does not pay dividends on a regular schedule or a
Background for the Dividend Discount Model                                                                         341


dividend that supplements regular cash dividends with an extra payment. Companies
in cyclical industries and companies undergoing corporate and/or financial restruc-
turing are among those observed to use extra dividends.1
     The payment of dividends is not a legal obligation: dividends must be declared
(i.e., authorized) by a company’s board of directors; in some jurisdictions, they must
also be approved by shareholders. Regular cash dividends are customarily declared
and paid out quarterly in the United States and Canada; semiannually in Europe and
Japan; and annually in some other countries, including China.
     Dividend discount models address discounting expected cash dividends. A stock
dividend (also known as a bonus issue of shares) is a type of dividend in which a
company distributes additional shares of its common stock (typically, 2%–10% of the
shares then outstanding) to shareholders instead of cash. A stock dividend divides the
“pie” (the market value of shareholders’ equity) into smaller pieces without affecting
the value of the pie or any shareholder’s proportional ownership in the company. Thus,
stock dividends are not relevant for valuation. Stock splits and reverse stock splits are
similar to stock dividends in that they have no economic effect on the company or
shareholders. A stock split involves an increase in the number of shares outstanding
with a consequent decrease in share price. An example of a stock split is a two-for-one
stock split in which each shareholder is issued an additional share for each share
currently owned. A reverse stock split involves a reduction in the number of shares
outstanding with a corresponding increase in share price. In a one-for-two reverse
stock split, each shareholder would receive one new share for every two old shares
held, thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding by half.
     In contrast to stock dividends and stock splits, share repurchases are an alternative
to cash dividend payments. A share repurchase (or buyback) is a transaction in which
a company uses cash to buy back its own shares. Shares that have been repurchased
are not considered for dividends, voting, or computing earnings per share. A share
repurchase is viewed as equivalent to the payment of cash dividends of equal value
in terms of the effect on shareholders’ wealth, all other things being equal. Company
managements have expressed several key reasons for engaging in share repurchases—
namely, (1) signaling a belief that their shares are undervalued (or, more generally, to
support share prices), (2) flexibility in the amount and timing of distributing cash to
shareholders, (3) tax efficiency in markets where tax rates on dividends exceed tax
rates on capital gains, and (4) the ability to absorb increases in outstanding shares
because of the exercise of employee stock options.
     The payout of regular cash dividends to common shareholders follows a fairly
standard chronology that is set in motion once the company’s board of directors
votes to pay the dividend. First is the declaration date, the day that the company
issues a statement declaring a specific dividend. Next comes the ex-dividend date
(or ex-date), the first date that a share trades without (i.e., “ex”) the dividend. This is
followed closely (one or two business days later) by the holder-of-record date (also
called the owner-of-record date, shareholder-of-record date, record date, date of
record, or date of book closure), the date that a shareholder listed on the company’s
books will be deemed to have ownership of the shares for purposes of receiving the
upcoming dividend; the amount of time between the ex-date and the holder-of-record
date is linked to the trade settlement cycle in force. The final milestone is the pay-
ment date (or payable date), which is the day that the company actually mails out
(or electronically transfers) a dividend payment to shareholders.




1 Another type of dividend is a liquidating dividend, which is a return of capital rather than a distribution
from earnings or retained earnings. Liquidating dividends are used when a company goes out of business
and distributes its net assets, sells a portion of its business for cash and distributes the sale’s proceeds, or
pays a dividend that exceeds its accumulated retained earnings.

If the issuing company is assumed to be a going concern, the intrinsic value of a share
is the present value of expected future dividends. If a constant required rate of return is
also assumed, then the DDM expression for the intrinsic value of a share is Equation 1:
                ∞           ​Dt​​
   	​V0​ ​ = ​∑​_            ​	
                (​ ​1 + r​)​t​

               t=1

where

    At the shareholder level, cash received from a common stock investment includes
any dividends received and the proceeds when shares are sold. If an investor intends
to buy and hold a share for one year, the value of the share today is the present value
of two cash flows—namely, the expected dividend plus the expected selling price in
one year:
               ​D​ ​+ ​P​ ​                 ​D​ ​                ​P​ ​
   	​V0​ ​ = _
             ​( 1 ) 11​ = _

    where P1 = the expected price per share at t = 1.
    To estimate the expected selling price, P1, the analyst could estimate the price
another investor with a one-year holding period would pay for the share in one year.
If V0 is based on D1 and P1, it follows that P1 could be estimated from D2 and P2:
               ​D​ ​+ ​P​ ​
   	​P1​ ​ = _
             ​​(​12 + r​)2​ ​

    Substituting the right side of this equation for P1 in Equation 2 results in V0
estimated as

Repeating this process, we find the value for n holding periods is the present value
of the expected dividends for the n periods plus the present value of the expected
price in n periods:

                          The expected value of a share at the end of the investment horizon—in effect, the
                          expected selling price—is often referred to as the terminal stock value (or terminal
                          value).

                             Estimating Share Value for a Three-Year Investment
                             Horizon

                             1. For the next three years, the annual dividends of a stock are expected to be
                                €2.00, €2.10, and €2.20. The stock price is expected to be €20.00 at the end of
                                three years. If the required rate of return on the shares is 10 percent, what is
                                the estimated value of a share?

                             Solution:
                                The present values of the expected future cash flows can be written as
                                follows:
                                           2.00           2.10           2.20          20.00

                                          ​( )1
                                                ​+ _
                                                   ​( )2
                                                         ​+ _
                                                            ​( )3
                                                                  ​+ _
                                                                     ​( )3
                                                                           ​
                                       ​ ​1.10​ ​ ​   ​ ​1.10​ ​ ​   ​ ​1.10​ ​ ​   ​ ​1.10​ ​ ​
                                Calculating and summing these present values gives an estimated share
                                value of V0 = 1.818 + 1.736 + 1.653 + 15.026 = €20.23.
                                The three dividends have a total present value of €5.207, and the terminal
                                stock value has a present value of €15.026, for a total estimated value of
                                €20.23.

                              Extending the holding period into the indefinite future, we can say that a stock’s
                          estimated value is the present value of all expected future dividends as shown in
                          Equation 1.
                              Consideration of an indefinite future is valid because businesses established as
                          corporations are generally set up to operate indefinitely. This general form of the DDM
                          applies even in the case in which the investor has a finite investment horizon. For that
                          investor, stock value today depends directly on the dividends the investor expects to
                          receive before the stock is sold and depends indirectly on the expected dividends for
                          periods subsequent to that sale, because those expected future dividends determine
                          the expected selling price. Thus, the general expression given by Equation 1 holds
                          irrespective of the investor’s holding period.
                              In practice, many analysts prefer to use a free-cash-flow-to-equity (FCFE) val-
                          uation model. These analysts assume that dividend-paying capacity should be
                          reflected in the cash flow estimates rather than expected dividends. FCFE is a mea-
                          sure of dividend-paying capacity. Analysts may also use FCFE valuation models for
                          a non-dividend-paying stock. To use a DDM, the analyst needs to predict the timing
                          and amount of the first dividend and all the dividends or dividend growth thereafter.
                          Making these predictions for non-dividend-paying stock accurately is typically difficult,
                          so in such cases, analysts often resort to FCFE models.
                              The calculation of FCFE starts with the calculation of cash flow from operations
                          (CFO). CFO is simply defined as net income plus non-cash expenses minus invest-
                          ment in working capital. FCFE is a measure of cash flow generated in a period that
                          is available for distribution to common shareholders. What does “available for dis-
                          tribution” mean? The entire CFO is not available for distribution; the portion of the
                          CFO needed for fixed capital investment (FCInv) during the period to maintain the
                          value of the company as a going concern is not viewed as available for distribution to
Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and Free-Cash-Flow-to-Equity Model (FCFE)                   345


common shareholders. Net amounts borrowed (borrowings minus repayments) are
considered to be available for distribution to common shareholders. Thus, FCFE can
be expressed as
   FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing  	                                            (4)
The information needed to calculate historical FCFE is available from a company’s
statement of cash flows and financial disclosures. Frequently, under the assumption
that management is acting in the interest of maintaining the value of the company as
a going concern, reported capital expenditure is taken to represent FCInv. Analysts
must make projections of financials to forecast future FCFE. Valuation obtained by
using FCFE involves discounting expected future FCFE by the required rate of return
on equity; the expression parallels Equation 1:
              ∞ ​FCFE​​

  Present Value Models

  1. An investor expects a share to pay dividends of $3.00 and $3.15 at the end
     of Years 1 and 2, respectively. At the end of the second year, the investor ex-
     pects the shares to trade at $40.00. The required rate of return on the shares
     is 8 percent. If the investor’s forecasts are accurate and the market price of
     the shares is currently $30, the most likely conclusion is that the shares are:
       A. overvalued.
       B. undervalued.
       C. fairly valued.
  Solution to 1:
      B is correct.
                       3.00           3.15          40.00
       	​V0​ ​ = _

                       ​+ _

                                ​+ _
                                   ​( )2
                                         ​ = 39.77​
                   ​ ​1.08​ ​ ​   ​ ​1.08​ ​ ​   ​ ​1.08​ ​ ​
      The value estimate of $39.77 exceeds the market price of $30, so the conclu-
      sion is that the shares are undervalued.

  2. Two investors with different holding periods but the same expectations and
     required rate of return for a company are estimating the intrinsic value of a
     common share of the company. The investor with the shorter holding period
     will most likely estimate a:
       A. lower intrinsic value.
       B. higher intrinsic value.
       C. similar intrinsic value.
  Solution to 2:
      C is correct. The intrinsic value of a security is independent of the investor’s
      holding period.

  3. An equity valuation model that focuses on expected dividends rather than
     the capacity to pay dividends is the:
       A. dividend discount model.

                                 B. free cash flow to equity model.
                                 C. cash flow return on investment model.
                             Solution to 3:
                                A is correct. Dividend discount models focus on expected dividends.

                              How is the required rate of return for use in present value models estimated? To
                          estimate the required rate of return on a share, analysts frequently use the capital
                          asset pricing model (CAPM):
                             Required rate of return on share i = Current expected risk
                             −
                             	​ free rate of return​
                               
                                                                                       ​	​                          (5)
                             + ​ Beta​i​​[​Market ​​(​equity​)​​ risk premium​]​​
                          Equation 5 states that the required rate of return on a share is the sum of the current
                          expected risk-free rate plus a risk premium that equals the product of the stock’s beta
                          (a measure of non-diversifiable risk) and the market risk premium (the expected return
                          of the market in excess of the risk-free return, where in practice, the “market” is often
                          represented by a broad stock market index). However, even if analysts agree that the
                          CAPM is an appropriate model, their inputs into the CAPM may differ. Thus, there
                          is no uniquely correct answer to the question: What is the required rate of return?
                              Other common methods for estimating the required rate of return for the stock
                          of a company include adding a risk premium that is based on economic judgments,
                          rather than the CAPM, to an appropriate risk-free rate (usually a government bond)
                          and adding a risk premium to the yield on the company’s bonds. Good business and
                          economic judgment is paramount in estimating the required rate of return. In many
                          investment firms, required rates of return are determined by firm policy.




              6           PREFERRED STOCK VALUATION

                                                calculate the intrinsic value of a non-callable, non-convertible
                                                preferred stock
                                                explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation
                                                model

                          General dividend discount models are relatively easy to apply to preferred shares.
                          In its simplest form, preferred stock is a form of equity (generally, non-voting) that
                          has priority over common stock in the receipt of dividends and on the issuer’s assets
                          in the event of a company’s liquidation. It may have a stated maturity date at which
                          time payment of the stock’s par (face) value is made or it may be perpetual with no
                          maturity date; additionally, it may be callable or convertible.
                              For a non-callable, non-convertible perpetual preferred share paying a level dividend
                          D and assuming a constant required rate of return over time, Equation 1 reduces to
                          the formula for the present value of a perpetuity. Its value is:
                                       ​D0​ ​
                             	​V0​ ​ = _
                                       ​ r ​	                                                                       (6)
                          For example, a $100 par value non-callable perpetual preferred stock offers an annual
                          dividend of $5.50. If its required rate of return is 6 percent, the value estimate would
                          be $5.50/0.06 = $91.67.
Preferred Stock Valuation                                                                      347


    For a non-callable, non-convertible preferred stock with maturity at time n, the
estimated intrinsic value can be estimated by using Equation 3 but using the preferred
stock’s par value, F, instead of Pn:
              n      ​Dt​​     _
   	​V0​ ​ = ​∑​_           ​+ ​
                                   F
                                          ​	
                ​(​1 + r​)​t​ ​(​1 + r​)​n​
                                                                                      (7)
             t=1

When Equation 7 is used, the most precise approach is to use values for n, r, and
D that reflect the payment schedule of the dividends. This method is similar to the
practice of fixed-income analysts in valuing a bond. For example, a non-convertible
preferred stock with a par value of £20.00, maturity in six years, a nominal required
rate of return of 8.20 percent, and semiannual dividends of £2.00 would be valued
by using an n of 12, an r of 4.10 percent, a D of £2.00, and an F of £20.00. The result
would be an estimated value of £31.01. Assuming payments are annual rather than
semiannual (i.e., assuming that n = 6, r = 8.20 percent, and D = £4.00) would result
in an estimated value of £30.84.
    Preferred stock issues are frequently callable (redeemable) by the issuer at some
point prior to maturity, often at par value or at prices in excess of par value that decline
to par value as the maturity date approaches. Such call options tend to reduce the
value of a preferred issue to an investor because the option to redeem will be exercised
by the issuer when it is in the issuer's favor and ignored when it is not. For example,
if an issuer can redeem shares at par value that would otherwise trade (on the basis
of dividends, maturity, and required rate of return) above par value, the issuer has
motivation to redeem the shares.
    Preferred stock issues can also include a retraction option that enables the holder of
the preferred stock to sell the shares back to the issuer prior to maturity on prespecified
terms. Essentially, the holder of the shares has a put option. Such put options tend to
increase the value of a preferred issue to an investor because the option to retract will
be exercised by the investor when it is in the investor's favor and ignored when it is
not. Although the precise valuation of issues with such embedded options is beyond
the scope of this reading, Example 6 includes a case in which Equation 7 can be used
to approximate the value of a callable, retractable preferred share.

   Preferred Share Valuation: Two Cases
   Case 1: Non-callable, Non-convertible, Perpetual Preferred
   Shares
   The following facts concerning the Union Electric Company 4.75 percent per-
   petual preferred shares are as follows:
        ■    Issuer: Union Electric Co. (owned by Ameren)
        ■    Par value: US$100
        ■    Dividend: US$4.75 per year
        ■    Maturity: perpetual
        ■    Embedded options: none
        ■    Credit rating: Moody’s Investors Service/Standard & Poor’s Ba1/BB
        ■    Required rate of return on Ba1/BB rated preferred shares as of valua-
             tion date: 7.5 percent.

                             1. Estimate the intrinsic value of this preferred share.
                                 Solution
                                 Basing the discount rate on the required rate of return on Ba1/BB rat-
                                 ed preferred shares of 7.5 percent gives an intrinsic value estimate of
                                 US$4.75/0.075 = US$63.33.

                             2. Explain whether the intrinsic value of this issue would be higher or lower if
                                the issue were callable (with all other facts remaining unchanged).
                                 Solution
                                 The intrinsic value would be lower if the issue were callable. The option
                                 to redeem or call the issue is valuable to the issuer because the call will be
                                 exercised when doing so is in the issuer’s interest. The intrinsic value of the
                                 shares to the investor will typically be lower if the issue is callable. In this
                                 case, because the intrinsic value without the call is much less than the par
                                 value, the issuer would be unlikely to redeem the issue if it were callable;
                                 thus, callability would reduce intrinsic value, but only slightly.

                             Case 2: Retractable Term Preferred Shares
                             Retractable term preferred shares are a type of preferred share that has been
                             previously issued by Canadian companies,and have now began to be offered by
                             companies in other jurisdictions, including Japan. This type of issue specifies a
                             “retraction date” when the preferred shareholders have the option to sell back
                             their shares to the issuer at par value (i.e., the shares are “retractable” or “putable”
                             at that date).2 At predetermined dates prior to the retraction date, the issuer
                             has the option to redeem the preferred issue at predetermined prices (which
                             are always at or above par value).
                                 An example of a retractable term preferred share currently outstanding is
                             TMC (Toyota Motor Corporation), First Series Model AA class shares, with a
                             0.5 percent dividend rate, increasing by 0.5 percent every year until 2020 and
                             thereafter, becoming fixed at 2.5 percent. TMC is leading global automobile
                             manufacturer, with headquarters in Japan and global operations. The issue is in
                             Japanese Yen. The shares have a ¥10,598 par value and pay a semiannual divi-
                             dend of ¥26.5 [= (0.5 percent × ¥10,598)/2] on 31 March 2016. The semiannual
                             dividend is expected to increase to ¥132.5 [= (2.5 percent × ¥10,598)/2] on 31
                             March 2020 and beyond. As of 31 December 2017 the company carried ratings
                             from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s of Aa3 and AA–, respectively. Thus, the
                             shares are viewed by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s as having “adequate” credit
                             quality, qualified by “Aa3 and AA–,” which means relatively high quality within
                             that group. Beginning from 2 April 2021, the shares are redeemable at the option
                             of TMC at ¥10,598 (par value). The retraction date is the last day of March, June,
                             September, and December of each year, starting from 1 September 2020, with
                             the shares retractable at par value. The Series AA shares have voting rights and
                             may exercise their voting rights and other rights held by holders of common
                             shares of TMC in the same manner. The Series AA shares were issued at a 20%
                             premium to the common shares price in 2015, and since then the share price has
                             decreased to ¥7,243 as at 31 December 2017, and with a current required rate of
                             3.05 per year (1.525 percent semiannual). Because the issue’s market price is so
                             far below the prices at which TMC could redeem or call the issue, redemption is
                             considered to be unlikely by TMC, whereas the retraction option for the Series


                          2 “Retraction” refers to this option, which is a put option. The terminology is not completely settled: The
                          type of share being called “retractable term preferred” is also known as “hard retractable preferred,” with
                          “hard” referring to payment in cash rather than common shares at the retraction date.
The Gordon Growth Model                                                                                       349


   AA holders appears to have a significant value since they will potentially be able
   to put back the shares to TMC at approximately 45 percent over the current
   market value (¥10,598 compared to ¥7,243).

   3. Assume that the issue will be retracted in December 2020; the holders of
      the shares will put the shares to the company in December 2020. Based on
      the information given, estimate the intrinsic value of a share. Assume it is
      December 2017.
      Solution
      An intrinsic value estimate of a share of this preferred issue is ¥10,279.
      Expected semiannual dividends:
       Year ended March 31, 2018: ¥79.5 [= (1.5 percent × ¥10,598)/2]

       Year ended March 31, 2019: ¥106 [= (2.0 percent × ¥10,598)/2]

THE GORDON GROWTH MODEL
                                                                                                          7
               calculate and interpret the intrinsic value of an equity security based
               on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a
               two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate

               explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation
               model

A rather obvious problem when one is trying to implement Equation 1 for common
equity is that it requires the analyst to estimate an infinite series of expected dividends.
To simplify this process, analysts frequently make assumptions about how dividends
will grow or change over time. The Gordon (constant) growth model (Gordon, 1962)
is a simple and well-recognized DDM. The model assumes dividends grow indefinitely
at a constant rate.
     Because of its assumption of a constant growth rate, the Gordon growth model is
particularly appropriate for valuing the equity of dividend-paying companies that are
relatively insensitive to the business cycle and in a mature growth phase. Examples
might include an electric utility serving a slowly growing area or a producer of a staple
food product (e.g., bread). A history of increasing the dividend at a stable growth rate
is another practical criterion if the analyst believes that pattern will hold in the future.
     With a constant growth assumption, Equation 1 can be written as Equation 8,
where g is the constant growth rate:

                          If required return r is assumed to be strictly greater than growth rate g, then the
                          square-bracketed term in Equation 8 is an infinite geometric series and sums to [(1
                          + g)/(r – g)]. Substituting into Equation 8 produces the Gordon growth model as
                          presented in Equation 9:
                                        ​D0​ ​(​ ​1 + g​)​​   ​D​ ​

                                        ​ r−g ​= _          ​r −1g ​	                                                                      (9)

                          For an illustration of the expression, suppose the current (most recent) annual divi-
                          dend on a share is €5.00 and dividends are expected to grow at 4 percent per year. The
                          required rate of return on equity is 8 percent. The Gordon growth model estimate of
                          intrinsic value is, therefore, €5.00(1.04)/(0.08 – 0.04) = €5.20/0.04 = €130 per share.
                          Note that the numerator is D1 not D0. (Using the wrong numerator is a common error.)
                              The Gordon growth model estimates intrinsic value as the present value of a
                          growing perpetuity. If the growth rate, g, is assumed to be zero, Equation 8 reduces
                          to the expression for the present value of a perpetuity, given earlier as Equation 6.
                              In estimating a long-term growth rate, analysts use a variety of methods, including
                          assessing the growth in dividends or earnings over time, using the industry median
                          growth rate, and using the relationship shown in Equation 10 to estimate the sus-
                          tainable growth rate:
                              g = b × ROE  	                                                                                              (10)
                              where

                                    g = dividend growth rate

                                    b = earnings retention rate = (1 – Dividend payout ratio)

                              ROE = return on equity
                              Example 7 illustrates the application of the Gordon growth model to the shares of
                          a large industrial manufacturing company. The analyst believes it will continue to grow
                          at a rate that it achieved in the previous three years and remain stable in the future.
                          The example asks how much the dividend growth assumption adds to the intrinsic
                          value estimate. The question is relevant to valuation because if the amount is high on
                          a percentage basis, a large part of the value of the share depends on the realization of
                          the growth estimate. One can answer the question by subtracting from the intrinsic
                          value estimate determined by Equation 9 the value determined by Equation 6, which
                          assumes no dividend growth.3

      The analyst estimates the growth rate to be approximately 5.4 percent based
  on the dividend growth rate over the period 2013 to 2017 [3(1 + g)4 = 3.7, so g
  = 5.4%]. To verify that the estimated growth rate of 5.4 percent is feasible in the
  future, the analyst also uses the average of Siemens’s retention rate and ROE
  for the previous five years (g ≈ 0.49 × 17.3% ≈ 8.5%) to estimate the sustainable
  growth rate.
      Using a number of approaches, including adding a risk premium to a long-
  term German government bond and using the CAPM, the analyst estimates a
  required return of 7.5 percent. The most recent dividend of €3.70 is used for D0.

  1. Use the Gordon growth model to estimate Siemens’s intrinsic value.

  Solution to 1:
              €3.70​​(​1 + 0.054​)​​
      	​V0​ ​ = _____________

                        − 0.054 ​ = €185.70​


  2. How much does the dividend growth assumption add to the intrinsic value
     estimate?

  Solution to 2:
                    €3.70
      	​€185.70 − _
                  ​0.075 ​ = €136.37​


  3. Based on the estimated intrinsic value, is a share of Siemens undervalued,
     overvalued, or fairly valued?

  Solution to 3:
     A share of Siemens appears to be undervalued. The analyst, before making a
     recommendation, might consider how realistic the estimated inputs are and
     check the sensitivity of the estimated value to changes in the inputs.

  4. What is the intrinsic value if the growth rate estimate is lowered to 4.4
     percent?

                                 The Gordon growth model estimate of intrinsic value is extremely sensitive
                                 to the choice of required rate of return r and growth rate g. It is possible that
                                 the growth rate assumption and the required return assumption used initial-
                                 ly were too high. Worldwide economic growth is typically in the low single
                                 digits, which may mean that a large company such as Siemens may struggle
                                 to grow dividends at 5.4 percent into perpetuity. Exhibit 4 presents a further

                                 Note that no value is shown when the growth rate exceeds the required rate
                                 of return. The Gordon growth model assumes that the growth rate cannot
                                 be greater than the required rate of return.

                             The assumptions of the Gordon model are as follows:
                             ■    Dividends are the correct metric to use for valuation purposes.
                             ■    The dividend growth rate is forever: It is perpetual and never changes.
                             ■    The required rate of return is also constant over time.
                             ■    The dividend growth rate is strictly less than the required rate of return.
                             An analyst might be dissatisfied with these assumptions for many reasons. The
                          equities being examined might not currently pay a dividend. The Gordon assumptions
                          might be too simplistic to reflect the characteristics of the companies being evaluated.
                          Some alternatives to using the Gordon model are as follows:
                             ■    Use a more robust DDM that allows for varying patterns of growth.
                             ■    Use a cash flow measure other than dividends for valuation purposes.
                             ■    Use some other approach (such as a multiplier method) to valuation.
                              Applying a DDM is difficult if the company being analyzed is not currently paying a
                          dividend. A company may not be paying a dividend if 1) the investment opportunities
                          the company has are all so attractive that the retention and reinvestment of funds is
                          preferable, from a return perspective, to the distribution of a dividend to shareholders
                          or 2) the company is in such shaky financial condition that it cannot afford to pay a
                          dividend. An analyst might still use a DDM to value such companies by assuming that
                          dividends will begin at some future point in time. The analyst might further assume
                          that constant growth occurs after that date and use the Gordon growth model for

valuation. Extrapolating from no current dividend, however, generally yields highly
uncertain forecasts. Analysts typically choose to use one or more of the alternatives
instead of or as a supplement to the Gordon growth model.

EXAMPLE 8

  Gordon Growth Model in the Case of No Current Dividend

  1. A company does not currently pay a dividend but is expected to begin to do
     so in five years (at t = 5). The first dividend is expected to be $4.00 and to be
     received five years from today. That dividend is expected to grow at 6 per-
     cent into perpetuity. The required return is 10 percent. What is the estimat-
     ed current intrinsic value?

  Solution:
     The analyst can value the share in two pieces:

      1. The analyst uses the Gordon growth model to estimate the value at t =
         5; in the model, the year-ahead dividend is $4(1.06). Then the analyst
         finds the present value of this value as of t = 0.
      2. The analyst finds the present value of the $4 dividend not “counted”
         in the estimate in Piece 1 (which values dividends from t = 6 onward).
         Note that the statement of the problem implies that D0, D1, D2, D3,
         and D4 are zero.
     Piece 1: The value of this piece is $65.818:
               ​Dn​ ​(​ ​1 + g​)​​  ​Dn+1
                                      ​ ​
      ​Vn​ ​ = _
               ​ r−g ​= _          ​r − g ​
                 $4​​ ​1 + 0.06​ ​​
                  (               ) $4.24
     ​V	​ 5​ ​ = _
        
                 ​ 0.10 − 0.06 ​ = _   ​ ​ = $106​​
                                    ​0.04
                   $106
     ​V0​ ​ = _
              ​( )5
                    ​ = $65.818
              ​ ​1 + 0.10​ ​ ​
     Piece 2: The value of this piece is $2.484:
                      $4
      	​V0​ ​ = _
                ​( )5
                      ​ = $2.484​
                ​ ​1 + 0.10​ ​ ​
     The sum of the two pieces is $65.818 + $2.484 = $68.30.
     Alternatively, the analyst could value the share at t = 4, the point at which
     dividends are expected to be paid in the following year and from which
     point they are expected to grow at a constant rate.
                   $4.00              $4.00
       ​V4​ ​ = _​0.10 − 0.06 ​ = _​0.04 ​ = $100
         
        	​           $100                        ​​
      ​V0​ ​ = _​(         )4
                              ​ = $68.30
               ​ ​1 + 0.10​ ​ ​

                                               on the Gordon (constant) growth dividend discount model or a
                                               two-stage dividend discount model, as appropriate
                                               identify characteristics of companies for which the constant growth
                                               or a multistage dividend discount model is appropriate
                                               explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation
                                               model

                          Multistage growth models are often used to model rapidly growing companies. The
                          two-stage DDM assumes that at some point the company will begin to pay dividends
                          that grow at a constant rate, but prior to that time the company will pay dividends
                          that are growing at a higher rate than can be sustained in the long run. That is, the
                          company is assumed to experience an initial, finite period of high growth, perhaps
                          prior to the entry of competitors, followed by an infinite period of sustainable growth.
                          The two-stage DDM thus makes use of two growth rates: a high growth rate for an
                          initial, finite period followed by a lower, sustainable growth rate into perpetuity. The
                          Gordon growth model is used to estimate a terminal value at time n that reflects the
                          present value at time n of the dividends received during the sustainable growth period.
                              Equation 11 will be used here as the starting point for a two-stage valuation model.
                          The two-stage valuation model is similar to Example 8 except that instead of assuming
                          zero dividends for the initial period, the analyst assumes that dividends will exhibit a
                          high rate of growth during the initial period. Equation 11 values the dividends over
                          the short-term period of high growth and the terminal value at the end of the period
                          of high growth. The short-term growth rate, gS, lasts for n years. The intrinsic value
                          per share in year n, Vn, represents the year n value of the dividends received during
                          the sustainable growth period or the terminal value at time n. Vn can be estimated by
                          using the Gordon growth model as shown in Equation 12, where gL is the long-term
                          or sustainable growth rate. The dividend in year n + 1, Dn+1, can be determined by
                          using Equation 13:
                                          n ​D​ ​​ ​1 + ​g​ ​ ​t​

                            1. The current dividend, D0, is $5.00. Growth is expected to be 10 percent
                               a year for three years and then 5 percent thereafter. The required rate of
                               return is 15 percent. Estimate the intrinsic value.

                            Solution:
                                  D1 = $5.00(1 + 0.10) = $5.50

    The DDM can be extended to as many stages as deemed appropriate. For most
publicly traded companies (that is, companies beyond the start-up stage), practitioners
assume growth will ultimately fall into three stages: 1) growth, 2) transition, and 3)
maturity. This assumption supports the use of a three-stage DDM, which makes use
of three growth rates: a high growth rate for an initial finite period, followed by a
lower growth rate for a finite second period, followed by a lower, sustainable growth
rate into perpetuity.
    One can make the case that a three-stage DDM would be most appropriate for a
fairly young company, one that is just entering the growth phase. The two-stage DDM
would be appropriate to estimate the value of an older company that has already
moved through its growth phase and is currently in the transition phase (a period
with a higher growth rate than the sustainable growth rate) prior to moving to the
maturity phase (the period with a lower, sustainable growth rate).
    However, the choice of a two-stage DDM need not rely solely on the age of a
company. Long-established companies sometimes manage to restart above-average
growth through, for example, innovation, expansion to new markets, or acquisitions.
Or a company’s long-run growth rate may be interrupted by a period of subnormal
performance. If growth is expected to moderate (in the first case) or improve (in the
second case) toward some long-term growth rate, a two-stage DDM may be appro-
priate. Thus, we chose a two-stage DDM to value International Business Machines
Corporation in Example 10.

  Two-Stage Dividend Discount Model: International
  Business Machines Corporation
  International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a US based leading tech-
  nology company. IBM was founded in 1911, initially as a company that manufac-
  tured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial
  time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to punched cards. IBM introduced the
  personal computer in 1981; however, by the 1990s, it began to suffer losses in
  its core computer manufacturing business and by the 2000s, it had begun to
  diversify into business consulting, which was finalized in 2005 when it sold its
  personal computer business to Chinese company Lenovo. IBM now operates
  through five segments: Cognitive Solutions, Global Business Services (GBS),
  Technology Services & Cloud Platforms, Systems, and Global Financing. The
  Cognitive Solutions segment delivers a spectrum of capabilities from descriptive,
  predictive, and prescriptive analytics to cognitive systems. Cognitive Solutions
  includes Watson, a cognitive computing platform that has the ability to interact
  in natural language, process big data, and learn from interactions with people
  and computers. The GBS segment provides clients with consulting, application
  management services, and global process services. The Technology Services
  & Cloud Platforms segment provides information technology infrastructure

                             services. The Systems segment provides clients with infrastructure technologies.
                             The Global Financing segment includes client financing, commercial financing,
                             and remanufacturing and remarketing.
                                 The 30 July 2018 Value Line report on IBM appears in Exhibit 5. IBM has
                             increased its dividends every year over the past 15 years. Information from
                             Value Line shows that the dividend growth is around 17.0 percent for the past 10
                             years, 13.5 percent for the past 5 years, and estimated to be 4.5 percent for 2015
                             to 2023. After a period of growth through acquisition and merger, the pattern
                             suggests that IBM may be transitioning to a mature growth phase.
                                 The two-stage DDM is arguably a good choice for valuing IBM because the
                             company appears to be transitioning from a high-growth phase (note the 13.5
                             percent dividend growth for the past 5 years) to a lower-growth phase (note the
                             forecast of 4.5 percent dividend growth to 2015–2023).
                                 The CAPM can be used to estimate the required return, r, for IBM. The Value
                             Line report (in the top left corner) estimates beta to be 0.95. Using the yield of
                             about 2.0 percent on 10-year US Treasury notes as a proxy for the risk-free rate
                             and assuming an equity risk premium of 5.0 percent, we find the estimate for r
                             would be 6.75 percent [2.0% + 0.95(5.0%)].
                                 To estimate the intrinsic value at the end of 2018, we use the 2018 dividend
                             of US$6.21 from the Value Line report. The dividend is assumed to grow at a
                             rate of 5.0 percent for one year and then 2.33 percent thereafter. The growth rate
                             assumption for the first stage is consistent with the Value Line forecast for the
                             2018 and 2019 dividends. Our assumption of a 2.33 percent perpetual growth
                             rate produces an 8-year growth rate assumption near 4.5%,4 which is consistent
                             with the Value Line forecast of 4.5 percent growth from 2015–2022. Thus:
                                 D2019 = US$6.21(1 + 0.05) = US$6.5205

                                 D2020 = US$6.21(1 + 0.05)(1 + 0.0233) = US$6.6724

                                 D2021 = US$6.21(1 + 0.05)(1 + 0.0233)2 = US$6.8279

                          PRICE MULTIPLES, PRESENT VALUE MODELS, AND
                          FUNDAMENTALS

                                        explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how
                                        the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of
                                        multiples based on comparables
                                        calculate and interpret the following multiples: price to earnings,
                                        price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price
                                        to book value
                                        explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation
                                        model

                          The term price multiple refers to a ratio that compares the share price with some
                          sort of monetary flow or value to allow evaluation of the relative worth of a company’s
                          stock. Some practitioners use price ratios as a screening mechanism. If the ratio falls
                          below a specified value, the shares are identified as candidates for purchase, and if the
                          ratio exceeds a specified value, the shares are identified as candidates for sale. Many
                          practitioners use ratios when examining a group or sector of stocks and consider the
                          shares for which the ratio is relatively low to be attractively valued securities.
                              Price multiples that are used by security analysts include the following:
                              ■   Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). This measure is the ratio of the stock price to
                                  earnings per share. P/E is arguably the price multiple most frequently cited
                                  by the media and used by analysts and investors (Block 1999). The seminal
                                  works of McWilliams (1966), Miller and Widmann (1966), Nicholson (1968),
                                  Dreman (1977), and Basu (1977) presented evidence of a return advantage
                                  to low-P/E stocks.
                              ■   Price-to-book ratio (P/B). The ratio of the stock price to book value per
                                  share. Considerable evidence suggests that P/B multiples are inversely
                                  related to future rates of return (Fama and French 1995).
                              ■   Price-to-sales ratio (P/S). This measure is the ratio of stock price to sales per
                                  share. O’Shaughnessy (2005) provided evidence that a low P/S multiple is
                                  the most useful multiple for predicting future returns.
                              ■   Price-to-cash-flow ratio (P/CF). This measure is the ratio of stock price to
                                  some per-share measure of cash flow. The measures of cash flow include
                                  free cash flow (FCF) and operating cash flow (OCF).
                              A common criticism of all of these multiples is that they do not consider the future.
                          This criticism is true if the multiple is calculated from trailing or current values of the
                          divisor. Practitioners seek to counter this criticism by a variety of techniques, including
                          forecasting fundamental values (the divisors) one or more years into the future. The
                          resulting forward (leading or prospective) price multiples may differ markedly from
                          the trailing price multiples. In the absence of an explicit forecast of fundamental val-
                          ues, the analyst is making an implicit forecast of the future when implementing such
                          models. The choice of price multiple—trailing or forward—should be used consistently
                          for companies being compared.
                              Besides the traditional price multiples used in valuation, just presented, analysts
                          need to know how to calculate and interpret other ratios. Such ratios include those
                          used to analyze business performance and financial condition based on data reported
                          in financial statements. In addition, many industries have specialized measures of
Multipler Models and Relationship Among Price Multiples, Present Value Models, and Fundamentals   359


business performance that analysts covering those industries should be familiar with.
In analyzing cable television companies, for example, the ratio of total market value of
the company to the total number of subscribers is commonly used. Another common
measure is revenue per subscriber. In the oil industry, a commonly cited ratio is proved
reserves per common share. Industry-specific or sector-specific ratios such as these
can be used to understand the key business variables in an industry or sector as well
as to highlight attractively valued securities.


Relationships among Price Multiples, Present Value Models,
and Fundamentals
Price multiples are frequently used independently of present value models. One price
multiple valuation approach, the method of comparables, does not involve cash flow
forecasts or discounting to present value. A price multiple is often related to funda-
mentals through a discounted cash flow model, however, such as the Gordon growth
model. Understanding such connections can deepen the analyst’s appreciation of the
factors that affect the value of a multiple and often can help explain reasons for differ-
ences in multiples that do not involve mispricing. The expressions that are developed
can be interpreted as the justified value of a multiple—that is, the value justified by
(based on) fundamentals or a set of cash flow predictions. These expressions are an
alternative way of presenting intrinsic-value estimates.
    As an example, using the Gordon growth model identified previously in Equation
9 and assuming that price equals intrinsic value (P0 = V0), we can restate Equation
9 as follows:
               ​D​ ​
   	​P0​ ​ = _
             ​r −1g ​	                                                               (14)

To arrive at the model for the justified forward P/E given in Equation 15, we divide
both sides of Equation 14 by a forecast for next year’s earnings, E1. In Equation 15,
the dividend payout ratio, p, is the ratio of dividends to earnings:
   _  ​P0​ ​  ​D​ ​/ ​E​ ​    p
   	​​E​ ​​ = _
              ​r 1− g1 ​ = _
                           ​r − g ​	                                                 (15)
        1

Equation 15 indicates that the P/E is inversely related to the required rate of return and
positively related to the growth rate; that is, as the required rate of return increases,
the P/E declines, and as the growth rate increases, the P/E increases. The P/E and the
payout ratio appear to be positively related. This relationship may not be true, how-
ever, because a higher payout ratio may imply a slower growth rate as a result of the
company retaining a lower proportion of earnings for reinvestment. This phenomenon
is referred to as the dividend displacement of earnings.

                              Explain how the information shown supports a higher P/E for Petrobras
                              than for the industry.

                           Solution:
                              The data support a higher P/E for Petrobras because its (MRQ) EPS growth
                              rate exceed those of the industry. Equation 15 implies a positive relationship
                              between the payout ratio and the P/E multiple. Petrobras has had a nega-
                              tive EPS for the period 2014 to 2017, and has paid no dividend during that
                              period. A higher payout ratio supports a higher P/E. Furthermore, to the
                              extent that higher EPS growth implies a high growth rate in dividends, the
                              high EPS growth rate supports a high P/E. The higher P/E ratio is due to an
                              improvement in the underlying financial performance of the company and
                              the expected higher growth potential of the stock compared to the median
                              firms in the industry.

                           Heinrich Gladisch, CFA, is estimating the justified forward P/E for Nestlé, one
                           of the world’s leading nutrition and health companies. Gladisch notes that sales
                           for 2017 were SFr89.78 billion (US$90.3 billion) and that net income was SFr7.18
                           billion (US$7.25 billion). He organizes the data for EPS, dividends per share,

                               Gladisch calculates that ROE averaged 15.5 percent in the period 2013−2017
                           but was below that level at 11.7 percent in 2017. In that year, however, Nestlé’s
                           reported net income included a large nonrecurring component. The company
                           reported 2017 “underlying earnings,” which it defined as net income “from con-
                           tinuing operations before impairments, restructuring costs, results on disposals
                           and significant one-off items,” to be SFr2.93, giving an adjusted 14.8% ROE.
                           Predicting increasing improvement in Nestlé’s profit margins from growth in
                           its product markets, Gladisch estimates a long-run ROE of 21.5 percent.
Multipler Models and Relationship Among Price Multiples, Present Value Models, and Fundamentals   361


      Gladisch decides that the dividend payout ratios of the 2013–2016 period—
  averaging 67.7 percent—are more representative of Nestlé’s future payout ratio
  than is the high 2017 dividend payout ratio (when based on reported earnings).
  The dividend payout ratio in 2017 was higher because management apparently
  based the 2017 dividend on the components of net income that were expected
  to continue into the future. But basing a dividend on net income including
  non-recurring items creates the potential need to increase dividends in the
  future. Rounding up the 2013−2017 average, Gladisch settles on an estimate of
  68 percent for the dividend payout ratio for use in calculating a justified forward
  P/E using Equation 15.
      Gladisch’s firm estimates that the required rate of return for Nestlé’s shares
  is 9 percent per year. Gladisch also finds the following data at the opposite ends
  of the spectrum of external research analyst forecasts:

  1. Based only on information and estimates developed by Gladisch and his
     firm, estimate Nestlé’s justified forward P/E.

  Solution to 1:
     The estimate of the justified forward P/E is 32.38. The dividend growth rate
     can be estimated by using Equation 10 as (1 – Dividend payout ratio) × ROE
     = (1 – 0.68) × 0.21.5 = 0.069, or 6.9 percent. Therefore,

      _  ​P0​ ​  Payout          0.68
      	​​E​ ​​ = _
                 ​r − g ​ = _
                            ​0.09 − 0.069 ​ = 32.38​
           1



  2. Compare and contrast the justified forward P/E estimate from Question 1
     to the estimates from each end of the spectrum of external research analysts
     forecasts.

  Solution to 2:
     The estimated justified forward P/E of 32.38 is higher than the justified 2018
     P/E estimates of 26.3 and 19.3 of the two analysts. Using a required rate of
     return of 9.5 percent rather than 9 percent results in a justified forward P/E
     estimate of 26.2 = 0.68/(0.095 – 0.069). Using an ROE of 16.5 percent (the
     average ROE of the 2013–2016 period) rather than 21.5 percent results in a
     justified forward P/E estimate of 18.4 = 0.68/[0.09 – (0.32)(0.165)] = 0.68/
     (0.09 – 0.053). The justified forward P/E is very sensitive to changes in the
     inputs.

   Justified forward P/E estimates can be sensitive to small changes in assumptions.
Therefore, analysts can benefit from carrying out a sensitivity analysis, as shown in
Exhibit 6, which is based on Example 12. Exhibit 6 shows how the justified forward

                          P/E varies with changes in the estimates for the dividend payout ratio (columns) and
                          return on equity. The dividend growth rate (rows) changes because of changes in the
                          retention rate (1 – Payout rate) and ROE. Recall g = ROE times retention rate.

                          ON PRICE MULTIPLES

                                           explain the rationale for using price multiples to value equity, how
                                           the price to earnings multiple relates to fundamentals, and the use of
                                           multiples based on comparables
                                           calculate and interpret the following multiples: price to earnings,
                                           price to an estimate of operating cash flow, price to sales, and price
                                           to book value
                                           explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation
                                           model

                          The method of comparables is the most widely used approach for analysts reporting
                          valuation judgments on the basis of price multiples. This method essentially compares
                          relative values estimated using multiples or the relative values of multiples. The eco-
                          nomic rationale underlying the method of comparables is the law of one price: Identical
                          assets should sell for the same price. The methodology involves using a price multiple
                          to evaluate whether an asset is fairly valued, undervalued, or overvalued in relation to
                          a benchmark value of the multiple. Choices for the benchmark multiple include the
                          multiple of a closely matched individual stock or the average or median value of the
                          multiple for the stock’s industry. Some analysts perform trend or time-series analyses
                          and use past or average values of a price multiple as a benchmark.
                              Identifying individual companies or even an industry as the “comparable” may
                          present a challenge. Many large corporations operate in several lines of business,
                          so the scale and scope of their operations can vary significantly. When identifying
                          comparables (sometimes referred to as “comps”), the analyst should be careful to
                          identify companies that are most similar according to a number of dimensions. These

dimensions include (but are not limited to) overall size, product lines, and growth
rate. The type of analysis shown in Section 5.1 relating multiples to fundamentals
is a productive way to identify the fundamental variables that should be taken into
account in identifying comparables.

  Method of Comparables (1)

  1. As noted previously, P/E is a price multiple frequently used by analysts.
     Using P/E in the method of comparables can be problematic, however, as
     a result of business cycle effects on EPS. An alternative valuation tool that
     is useful during periods of economic slowdown or extraordinary growth is
     the P/S multiple. Although sales will decline during a recession and increase
     during a period of economic growth, the change in sales will be less than
     the change in earnings in percentage terms because earnings are heavily
     influenced by fixed operating and financing costs (operating and financial
     leverage).

     Based on the data presented, which stock appears to be undervalued when
     compared with the others?

  Solution:
     The P/S analysis suggests that Peugeot shares offer the best value. An analyst
     must be alert for a range of potential explanations of apparently low or high
     multiples when performing comparables analysis, rather than just assuming
     a relative mispricing.

                             1. Incorporated in the Netherlands, Airbus is active in the aerospace and
                                defense industry. It is a dominant aerospace company in Europe. Its largest
                                business, Airbus Commercial Aircraft, is a manufacturing company with
                                bases in several European countries and accounts for the majority of Airbus
                                SE profits. Airbus and its primary competitor, Boeing, control most of the
                                global commercial airplane industry.

                                 Comparisons are frequently made between Airbus and Boeing. As noted in
                                 Exhibit 7, the companies are broadly similar in size as measured by total rev-
                                 enues. Converting total forecast revenues from euros to US dollars using the
                                 average exchange rate for 2017 of US$1.13/€ results in a value of $75.5 bil-
                                 lion for Airbus’s total revenues. Thus, total revenues for Boeing are expected
                                 to be about a fifth higher than those for Airbus.

                                 The companies do differ, however, in several important areas. Airbus derives
                                 a greater share of its revenue from commercial aircraft production than
                                 does Boeing, and the order backlog for Airbus is much higher than that for
                                 Boeing. Converting the Airbus order backlog from euros to US dollars using
                                 the quarter-end rate for September 2017 of $1.1813/€ results in a value of
                                 $1.12 billion for Airbus’s order backlog. Thus, the order backlog for Airbus
                                 is more than twice as high as the backlog for Boeing.5

Method of Comparables and Valuation Based on Price Multiples                                 365



  Solution:
     Recall from Equation 14 and the discussion that followed it that P/E is
     directly related to the payout ratio and the dividend growth rate. The P/E is
     inversely related to the required rate of return. The only data presented in
     Exhibit 7 that support a higher P/E for Boeing is the company’s higher divi-
     dend payout ratio (expected at 56 percent versus 44 percent for Airbus).
     The following implicitly supports a higher P/E for Airbus: Airbus has higher
     revenue growth (as reported for 2016 and expected for 2017) and a higher
     backlog of orders, suggesting that it may have a higher future growth rate.

  Sources: EPS, year-end prices, and P/E data are from Capital IQ and the Financial Times.

  Solution:
     Trend analysis of Canon’s P/E reveals a peak of 23.9 at the end of 2016.
     The 2013 P/E of 16.6 is the lowest of the five years reported. This finding
     suggests that Canon’s share price may be fairly price as of year-end 2017. A
     bearish case for Canon’s stock can be made if an analyst believes that P/E
     will return to its historical low (16.6 over this five-year period) or be lower.
     Such a bearish prediction requires that a decrease in P/E not be offset by an
     increase in EPS. A bullish case can be made if the analyst believes the stock
     deserves re-rating and an even higher than trend P/E.

                                    Time-series analysis of all price multiples in Exhibit 8 suggests that both companies
                                    are currently attractively valued. For example, the 2017 price-to-revenue ratio (P/R)
                                    of 0.78 for Telefónica is below the 2015–2017 average for this ratio of approximately
                                    0.83. The 2017 P/CF of 3.7 for Deutsche Telekom is below the 2015–2017 average for
                                    this ratio of approximately 4.4.
                                        A comparative analysis produces somewhat mixed results. The 2017 values for
                                    Deutsche Telekom for the P/R, P/CF, P/E multiples are higher than those for Telefónica.
                                    This result suggests that Telefónica is attractively valued when compared with Deutsche
                                    Telekom. The 2017 P/B for Telefónica, however, is higher than for Deutsche Telekom.
                                        An analyst investigating these contradictory results would look for information not
                                    reported in Exhibit 8. For example, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
                                    and amortization (EBITDA) for Telefónica was €16.4 billion in 2017. The EBITDA
                                    value for Deutsche Telekom was €20.7 billion in 2017. The 2017 price-to-EBITDA
Enterprise Value                                                                                   367


ratio for Telefónica is [(7.93 × 5,123)/16,400] or [7.92/(16,400/5,123] = 2.5, whereas
the 2017 price-to-EBITDA ratio for Deutsche Telekom is 3.1. Thus, the higher P/E
for Deutsche Telekom can-not be explained by higher depreciation charges, higher
interest costs, and/or a greater tax burden, but appears to be due to a better quality
of earnings.
    In summary, the major advantage of using price multiples is that they allow for
relative comparisons, both cross-sectional (versus the market or another comparable)
and in time series. The approach can be especially beneficial for analysts who are
assigned to a particular industry or sector and need to identify the expected best per-
forming stocks within that sector. Price multiples are popular with investors because
the multiples can be calculated easily and many multiples are readily available from
financial websites and newspapers.
    Caution is necessary. A stock may be relatively undervalued when compared with
its benchmarks but overvalued when compared with an estimate of intrinsic value
as determined by one of the discounted cash flow methodologies. Furthermore,
differences in reporting rules among different markets and in chosen accounting
methods can result in revenues, earnings, book values, and cash flows that are not
easily comparable. These differences can, in turn, result in multiples that are not easily
comparable. Finally, the multiples for cyclical companies may be highly influenced by
current economic conditions.




ENTERPRISE VALUE
                                                                                              11

              model

An alternative to estimating the value of equity is to estimate the value of the enter-
prise. Enterprise value is most frequently determined as market capitalization plus
market value of preferred stock plus market value of debt minus cash and investments
(cash equivalents and short-term investments). Enterprise value is often viewed as
the cost of a takeover: In the event of a buyout, the acquiring company assumes the
acquired company’s debt but also receives its cash. Enterprise value is most useful
when comparing companies with significant differences in capital structure.
    Enterprise value (EV) multiples are widely used in Europe, with EV/EBITDA
arguably the most common. EBITDA is a proxy for operating cash flow because it
excludes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA may include other non-cash expenses,
however, and non-cash revenues. EBITDA can be viewed as a source of funds to pay
interest, dividends, and taxes. Because EBITDA is calculated prior to payment to
any of the company’s financial stakeholders, using it to estimate enterprise value is
logically appropriate.
    Using enterprise value instead of market capitalization to determine a multiple can
be useful to analysts. Even where the P/E is problematic because of negative earnings,
the EV/EBITDA multiple can generally be computed because EBITDA is usually
positive. An alternative to using EBITDA in EV multiples is to use operating income.
    In practice, analysts may have difficulty accurately assessing enterprise value if they
do not have access to market quotations for the company’s debt. When current market
quotations are not available, bond values may be estimated from current quotations for
bonds with similar maturity, sector, and credit characteristics. Substituting the book

                          value of debt for the market value of debt provides only a rough estimate of the debt’s
                          market value. This is because market interest rates change and investors’ perception
                          of the issuer’s credit risk may have changed since the debt was issued.

      Note from Exhibit 9 that the book value of long-term debt is $1,905,000 and
      its estimated market value is $1,480,170. The book value of total debt and li-
      abilities of $2,919,100 minus the book value of long-term debt of $1,905,000
      is $1,014,100. If we assume that the market value of that remaining debt is
      equal to its book value of $1,014,100 an estimate of the market value of total
      debt and liabilities is that amount plus the estimated market value of long-
      term debt of $1,480,170 or $2,494,270.
      At the end of 2017, Cameco had cash and equivalents of $591,600. Enter-
      prise value can be estimated as the $5,584,640 market value of stock plus the
      $2,494,270 market value of debt minus the $591,600 cash and equivalents,
      or $7,487,310. Cameco’s 2017 EBITDA was $606,000; an estimate of EV/
      EBITDA is, therefore, $7,487,310 divided by $606,000, or 12.4.

                                  Norilsk Nickel and Barrick Gold have the lowest EV/OI and thus appear to
                                  be the most undervalued or favorably priced on the basis of the EV/OI. Note
                                  the negative ratio for Glencore, Freeport-McMoRan, and Newmont Mining.
                                  Negative ratios are difficult to interpret, so other means are used to evaluate
                                  companies with negative ratios.




            12            ASSET-BASED VALUATION

                                          describe asset-based valuation models and their use in estimating
                                          equity value
                                          explain advantages and disadvantages of each category of valuation
                                          model

                          An asset-based valuation of a company uses estimates of the market or fair value of the
                          company’s assets and liabilities. Thus, asset-based valuations work well for companies
                          that do not have a high proportion of intangible or “off the books” assets and that do
                          have a high proportion of current assets and current liabilities. The analyst may be able
                          to value these companies’ assets and liabilities in a reasonable fashion by starting with
                          balance sheet items. For most companies, however, balance sheet values are different
                          from market (fair) values, and the market (fair) values can be difficult to determine.
                              Asset-based valuation models are frequently used together with multiplier models
                          to value private companies. As public companies increase reporting or disclosure of
                          fair values, asset-based valuation may be increasingly used to supplement present
                          value and multiplier models of valuation. Important facts that the practitioner should
                          realize are as follows:
                              ■    Companies with assets that do not have easily determinable market (fair)
                                   values—such as those with significant property, plant, and equipment—are
                                   very difficult to analyze using asset valuation methods.
                              ■    Asset and liability fair values can be very different from the values at which
                                   they are carried on the balance sheet of a company.
Asset-Based Valuation                                                                     371


   ■    Some assets that are “intangible” are shown on the books of the company.
        Other intangible assets, such as the value from synergies or the value of
        a good business reputation, may not be shown on the books. Because
        asset-based valuation may not consider some intangibles, it can give a
        “floor” value for a situation involving a significant amount of intangibles.
        When a company has significant intangibles, the analyst should prefer a
        forward-looking cash flow valuation.
   ■    Asset values may be more difficult to estimate in a hyper-inflationary
        environment.
    We begin by discussing asset-based valuation for hypothetical nonpublic companies
and then move on to a public company example. Analysts should consider the difficul-
ties and rewards of using asset-based valuation for companies that are suited to this
measure. Owners of small privately held businesses are familiar with valuations arrived
at by valuing the assets of the company and then subtracting any relevant liabilities.

EXAMPLE 18

  An Asset-Based Valuation of a Family-Owned Laundry

  1. A family owns a laundry and the real estate on which the laundry stands.
     The real estate is collateral for an outstanding loan of $100,000. How can
     asset-based valuation be used to value this business?

  Solution:
       The analyst should get at least two market appraisals for the real estate
       (building and land) and estimate the cost to extinguish the $100,000 loan.
       This information would provide estimated values for everything except the
       laundry as a going concern. That is, the analyst has market values for the
       building and land and the loan but needs to value the laundry business. The
       analyst can value the assets of the laundry: the equipment and inventory.
       The equipment can be valued at depreciated value, inflation-adjusted depre-
       ciated value, or replacement cost. Replacement cost in this case means the
       amount that would have to be spent to buy equivalent used machines. This
       amount is the market value of the used machines. The analyst will recognize
       that any intangible value of the laundry (prime location, clever market-
       ing, etc.) is being excluded, which will result in an inaccurate asset-based
       valuation.

    Example 18 shows some of the subtleties present in applying asset-based valuation
to determine company value. It also shows how asset-based valuation does not deal
with intangibles. Example 19 emphasizes this point.

EXAMPLE 19

  An Asset-Based Valuation of a Restaurant

  1. The business being valued is a restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch.
     The owner/proprietor wants to sell the business and retire. The restaurant
     space is rented, not owned. This particular restaurant is hugely popular
372   Learning Module 8                                                   Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools


                                because of the proprietor’s cooking skills and secret recipes. How can the
                                analyst value this business?

                             Solution:
                                Because of the intangibles, setting a value on this business is challenging. A
                                multiple of income or revenue might be considered. But even those ap-
                                proaches overlook the fact that the proprietor may not be selling his secret
                                recipes and, furthermore, does not intend to continue cooking. Some (or all)
                                of the intangible assets may vanish when the business is sold. Asset-based
                                valuation for this restaurant would begin with estimating the value of the
                                restaurant equipment and inventory and subtracting the value of any liabili-
                                ties. This approach will provide only a good baseline, however, for a mini-
                                mum valuation.

                              For public companies, the assets will typically be so extensive that a piece-by-piece
                          analysis will be impossible, and the transition from book value to market value is a
                          nontrivial task. The asset-based valuation approach is most applicable when the market
                          value of the corporate assets is readily determinable and the intangible assets, which
                          are typically difficult to value, are a relatively small proportion of corporate assets.
                          Asset-based valuation has also been applied to financial companies, natural resource
                          companies, and formerly going-concerns that are being liquidated. Even for other
                          types of companies, however, asset-based valuation of tangible assets may provide a
                          baseline for a minimal valuation.

                          EXAMPLE 20

                             An Asset-Based Valuation of an Airline

                             1. Consider the value of an airline company that has few routes, high labor and
                                other operating costs, has stopped paying dividends, and is losing millions
                                of dollars each year. Using most valuation approaches, the company will
                                have a negative value. Why might an asset-based valuation approach be
                                appropriate for use by one of the company’s competitors that is considering
                                acquisition of this airline?

                             Solution:
                                The airline’s routes, landing rights, leases of airport facilities, and ground
                                equipment and airplanes may have substantial value to a competitor. An
                                asset-based approach to valuing this company would value the company’s
                                assets separately and aside from the money-losing business in which they
                                are presently being utilized.

                              Analysts recognizing the uncertainties related to model appropriateness and the
                          inputs to the models frequently use more than one model or type of model in valu-
                          ation to increase their confidence in their estimates of intrinsic value. The choice of
                          models will depend on the availability of information to put into the models. Example
                          21 illustrates the use of three valuation methods.

                                Estimate of value = V5 = 2.55/(0.10 – 0.05) = $51.00


                             2. Using a multiplier approach, estimate intrinsic value. Assume that a reason-
                                able estimate of P/E is the average trailing twelve-month (TTM) P/E ratio
                                over Years 1 through 4.

                             Solution to 2:
                                Average P/E = (14.0 + 15.2 + 16.4 + 13.2)/4 = 14.7

                                Estimate of value = $4.00 × 14.7 = $58.80


                             3. Using an asset-based valuation approach, estimate value per share from
                                adjusted book values. Assume that the market values of accounts receivable
                                and inventories are as reported, the market value of net fixed assets is 110
                                percent of reported book value, and the reported book values of liabilities
                                reflect their market values.

                             Solution to 3:
                                Market value of assets = 5,000 + 15,000 + 30,000 + 1.1(50,000) = $105,000

                                Market value of liabilities = $3,000 + 17,000 + 25,000 = $45,000

                                Adjusted book value = $105,000 – 45,000 = $60,000

                                Estimated value (adjusted book value per share) = $60,000 ÷ 1,000 shares
                                = $60.00
                                Given the current share price of $50.80, the multiplier and the asset-based
                                valuation approaches indicate that the stock is undervalued. Given the
                                intrinsic value estimated using the Gordon growth model, the analyst is
                                likely to conclude that the stock is fairly priced. The analyst might examine

                             SUMMARY
                          The equity valuation models used to estimate intrinsic value—present value models,
                          multiplier models, and asset-based valuation—are widely used and serve an import-
                          ant purpose. The valuation models presented here are a foundation on which to base
                          analysis and research but must be applied wisely. Valuation is not simply a numerical
                          analysis. The choice of model and the derivation of inputs require skill and judgment.
                              When valuing a company or group of companies, the analyst wants to choose a
                          valuation model that is appropriate for the information available to be used as inputs.
                          The available data will, in most instances, restrict the choice of model and influence the
                          way it is used. Complex models exist that may improve on the simple valuation models
                          described in this reading; but before using those models and assuming that complexity
                          increases accuracy, the analyst would do well to consider the “law of parsimony:” A
Asset-Based Valuation                                                                      375


model should be kept as simple as possible in light of the available inputs. Valuation
is a fallible discipline, and any method will result in an inaccurate forecast at some
time. The goal is to minimize the inaccuracy of the forecast.
    Among the points made in this reading are the following:
   ■   An analyst estimating intrinsic value is implicitly questioning the market’s
       estimate of value.
   ■   If the estimated value exceeds the market price, the analyst infers the
       security is undervalued. If the estimated value equals the market price, the
       analyst infers the security is fairly valued. If the estimated value is less than
       the market price, the analyst infers the security is overvalued. Because of the
       uncertainties involved in valuation, an analyst may require that value esti-
       mates differ markedly from market price before concluding that a misvalua-
       tion exists.
   ■   Analysts often use more than one valuation model because of concerns
       about the applicability of any particular model and the variability in esti-
       mates that result from changes in inputs.
   ■   Three major categories of equity valuation models are present value, multi-
       plier, and asset-based valuation models.
   ■   Present value models estimate value as the present value of expected future
       benefits.
   ■   Multiplier models estimate intrinsic value based on a multiple of some fun-
       damental variable.
   ■   Asset-based valuation models estimate value based on the estimated value
       of assets and liabilities.
   ■   The choice of model will depend upon the availability of information to
       input into the model and the analyst’s confidence in both the information
       and the appropriateness of the model.
   ■   Companies distribute cash to shareholders using dividend payments and
       share repurchases.
   ■   Regular cash dividends are a key input to dividend valuation models.
   ■   Key dates in dividend chronology are the declaration date, ex-dividend date,
       holder-of-record date, and payment date.
   ■   In the dividend discount model, value is estimated as the present value of
       expected future dividends.
   ■   In the free cash flow to equity model, value is estimated as the present value
       of expected future free cash flow to equity.
   ■   The Gordon growth model, a simple DDM, estimates value as D1/(r – g).
   ■   The two stage dividend discount model estimates value as the sum of the
       present values of dividends over a short-term period of high growth and the
       present value of the terminal value at the end of the period of high growth.
       The terminal value is estimated using the Gordon growth model.
   ■   The choice of dividend model is based upon the patterns assumed with
       respect to future dividends.
   ■   Multiplier models typically use multiples of the form: P/ measure of funda-
       mental variable or EV/ measure of fundamental variable.
   ■   Multiples can be based upon fundamentals or comparables.
   ■   Asset-based valuations models estimate value of equity as the value of the
       assets less the value of liabilities.

                             ity rather than expected dividends will most likely use the:
                             A. dividend discount model.

                             B. free cash flow to equity model.

                          8. An investor expects to purchase shares of common stock today and sell them
                             after two years. The investor has estimated dividends for the next two years, D1
                             and D2, and the selling price of the stock two years from now, P2. According to
                             the dividend discount model, the intrinsic value of the stock today is the present
                             value of:
                             A. next year’s dividend, D1.

                             stock is calculated as:
                             A. the present value of future expected FCFE.

                             B. the present value of future expected FCFE plus net borrowing.

                             C. the present value of future expected FCFE minus fixed capital investment.

                          10. With respect to present value models, which of the following statements is most
                              accurate?
                             A. Present value models can be used only if a stock pays a dividend.

                             B. Present value models can be used only if a stock pays a dividend or is
                                expected to pay a dividend.

                             C. Present value models can be used for stocks that currently pay a dividend,
                                are expected to pay a dividend, or are not expected to pay a dividend.

                              required rate of return on similar issues is 4.49 percent. The intrinsic value of a
                              preferred share is closest to:

      dividends.

   B. Small changes in model assumptions and inputs can result in large changes
      in the computed intrinsic value of the security.

   C. The value of the security depends on the investor’s holding period; thus,
      comparing valuations of different companies for different investors is
      difficult.

                          18. An analyst is attempting to value shares of the Dominion Company. The company
                              has just paid a dividend of $0.58 per share. Dividends are expected to grow by 20
                              percent next year and 15 percent the year after that. From the third year onward,
                              dividends are expected to grow at 5.6 percent per year indefinitely. If the required
                              rate of return is 8.3 percent, the intrinsic value of the stock is closest to:
                             A. $26.00.

                              are expected to grow at the rate of 4 percent per year over the next four years. At
                              the end of four years, shares of Hideki Corporation are expected to sell for ¥9000.
                              If the required rate of return is 12 percent, the intrinsic value of a share of Hideki
                              Corporation is closest to:

                              at a rate of 3 percent annually. Which of the following is most likely to be the best
                              model for determining the intrinsic value of an Omega share?

24. An analyst makes the following statement: “Use of P/E and other multiples for
    analysis is not effective because the multiples are based on historical data and
    because not all companies have positive accounting earnings.” The analyst’s state-

   A. inaccurate with respect to both historical data and earnings.

   B. accurate with respect to historical data and inaccurate with respect to
      earnings.

   C. inaccurate with respect to historical data and accurate with respect to

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. A is correct. The current market price of the stock exceeds the upper bound of
                             the analyst’s estimate of the intrinsic value of the stock.

                          2. A is correct. The market price is less than the estimated intrinsic, or fundamental,
                             value.

                          3. C is correct. Asset-based valuation models calculate the intrinsic value of equity
                             by subtracting liabilities from the market value of assets.

                          4. C is correct. FCFE can be used in a form of present value, or discounted cash
                             flow, model. Both EV and price to free cash flow are forms of multiplier models.

                          5. C is correct. Multiplier valuation models (in the form of P/B) and asset-based
                             valuation models (in the form of adjustments to book value) use book value,
                             whereas present value models typically discount future expected cash flows.

                          6. B is correct. To use a discounted cash flow model, the analyst will require FCFE
                             or dividend data. In addition, the analyst will need data to calculate an appropri-
                             ate discount rate.

                          7. B is correct. The FCFE model assumes that dividend-paying capacity is reflected
                             in FCFE.

                          8. C is correct. According to the dividend discount model, the intrinsic value of a
                             stock today is the present value of all future dividends. In this case, the intrinsic
                             value is the present value of D1, D2, and P2. Note that P2 is the present value at
                             Period 2 of all future dividends from Period 3 to infinity.

                          9. A is correct. In the FCFE model, the intrinsic value of stock is calculated by
                             discounting expected future FCFE to present value. No further adjustments are
                             required.

                          10. C is correct. Dividend discount models can be used for a stock that pays a current
                              dividend or a stock that is expected to pay a dividend. FCFE can be used for both
                              of those stocks and for stocks that do not, or are not expected to, pay dividends in
                              the near future. Both of these models are forms of present value models.

                          11. B is correct. The expected annual dividend is 4.80% × $25 = $1.20. The value of a
                              preferred share is $1.20/0.0449 = $26.73.

                          12. B is correct. The required rate of return, r, can vary widely depending on the
                              inputs and is not unique. A preferred stock with a constant dividend would not
                              have a growth rate to estimate, and the investor’s time horizon would have no
                              effect on the calculation of intrinsic value.

                          13. C is correct. P0 = D1/(r – g) = 1.75(1.092)/(0.123 – 0.092) = $61.65.

                          14. C is correct. According to the Gordon growth model, V0 = D1/(r – g). In this case,
                              D1 = $2.00 × 1.04 = $2.08, so V0 = $2.08/(0.07 – 0.04) = $69.3333 = $69.33.

                          15. B is correct. The Gordon growth model (also known as the constant growth mod-
                              el) can be used to value dividend-paying companies in a mature phase of growth.
                              A stable dividend growth rate is often a plausible assumption for such companies.
Solutions                                                                                     385


16. B is correct. Very small changes in inputs, such as required rate of return or
    dividend growth rate, can result in large changes to the valuation model output.
    Some present value models, such as FCFE models, can be used to value compa-
    nies without dividends. Also, the intrinsic value of a security is independent of
    the investor’s holding period.

17. A is correct. The current price of €22.56 is less than the intrinsic value (V0) of
    €24.64; therefore, the stock appears to be currently undervalued. According to
    the two-stage dividend discount model:

20. C is correct. The Gordon growth model is best suited to valuing mature com-
    panies. The two-stage model is best for companies that are transitioning from a
    growth stage to a mature stage. The three-stage model is appropriate for young
    companies just entering the growth phase.

21. A is correct. The company is a mature company with a steadily growing dividend
    rate. The two-stage (or multistage) model is unnecessary because the dividend
    growth rate is expected to remain stable. Although an FCFE model could be used,
    that model is more often chosen for companies that currently pay no dividends.

                          22. C is correct. The justified forward P/E is calculated as follows:
                                          ​D​ ​
                                          _1

                                  1

                             P/E is inversely related to the required rate of return, r, and directly related to the
                             growth rate, g, and the dividend payout ratio, D/E.

                          23. A is correct. Multiples based on comparables are grounded in the law of one
                              price and take into account historical multiple values. In contrast, P/E multiples
                              based on fundamentals can be based on the Gordon growth model, which takes
                              into account future expected dividends.

                          24. A is correct. The statement is inaccurate in both respects. Although multiples
                              can be calculated from historical data, forecasted values can be used as well. For
                              companies without accounting earnings, several other multiples can be used.
                              These multiples are often specific to a company’s industry or sector and include
                              price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow.

                          25. B is correct.

                          26. A is correct. Tanaka shares are most likely overvalued. As the table below shows,
                              all the 2018 multiples are currently above their 2014–2017 averages.

                          27. B is correct. P/E = Current price/EPS, and Estimated P/E = Current price/Esti-
                              mated EPS.

                                    Alpha P/E = $57.32/$3.82 = 15.01
                                    Alpha estimated P/E = $57.32/4.75 = 12.07
                                    Delta P/E = $18.93/$1.35 = 14.02
                                    Delta estimated P/E = $18.93/$1.40 = 13.52

                          28. C is correct. Relative to the others, Pioneer Trust has the lowest P/E multiple
                              and the P/B multiple is tied for the lowest with Prime Bank. Given the law of one
                              price, similar companies should trade at similar P/B and P/E levels. Thus, based
                              on the information presented, Pioneer is most likely to be undervalued.

                          29. C is correct. Enterprise value is calculated as the market value of equity plus the
                              market value of debt and preferred stock minus short-term investments. There-
                              fore, the market value of equity is enterprise value minus the market value of debt
                              and preferred stock plus short-term investments.

                          30. A is correct. Operating income may be used in place of EBITDA when calculat-
                              ing the enterprise value multiple. EBITDA may be used when company earnings
Solutions                                                                                 387


   are negative because EBITDA is usually positive. The book value of debt cannot
   be used in place of market value of debt.

31. A is correct.
   EV = 10.2 × 22,000,000 = $224,400,000

   Equity value = EV – Debt + Cash

	 = 224,400,000 – 56,000,000 + 1,500,000

	 = $169,900,000

32. B is correct. The market value of debt must be calculated and taken out of the
    enterprise value. Enterprise value, sometimes known as the cost of a takeover, is
    the cost of the purchase of the company, which would include the assumption of
    the company’s debts at market value.

33. B is correct. According to the reading, analysts may have not have access to mar-
    ket quotations for company debt.

34. B is correct. Intangible assets are hard to value. Therefore, asset-based valuation
    models work best for companies that do not have a high proportion of intangible
    assets.

35. A is correct. Asset-based valuations are most often used when an analyst is valu-
    ing private enterprises. Both B and C are considerations in asset-based valua-
    tions but are more likely to be reasons to avoid that valuation model rather than
    reasons to use it.

36. A is correct. Although all models can be used to compare various companies,
    multiplier models have the advantage of reducing varying fundamental data
    points into a format that allows direct comparisons. As long as the analyst applies
    the data in a consistent manner for all the companies, this approach provides
    useful comparative data.
                                                                 G-1
