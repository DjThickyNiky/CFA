                                   How to Use the CFA
                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.
       The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam
       registration
    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the

      knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use
      the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
      later review.
          Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
      exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
      and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




      ERRATA
      The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
      reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
      errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
      updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
      (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
      error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
      reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

                        standards that put a framework around ethical behavior and technical competence.
                        Professions also set the wider goal of gaining and maintaining the trust of society as
                        a whole. In this regard, professions have a sense of purpose that society values.
                             Imagine that you are employed in the research department of a large financial
                        services firm. You and your colleagues spend your days researching, analyzing, and
                        valuing the shares of publicly traded companies and sharing your investment recom-
                        mendations with clients. You love your work and take great satisfaction in knowing
                        that your recommendations can help the firm’s investing clients make informed invest-
                        ment decisions that will help them meet their financial goals and improve their lives.
                             Several months after starting at the firm, you learn that an analyst at the firm has
                        been terminated for writing and publishing research reports that misrepresented the
                        fundamental risks of some companies to investors. You learn that the analyst wrote
                        the reports with the goal of pleasing the management of the companies that were
                        the subjects of the research reports. He hoped that these companies would hire your
                        firm’s investment banking division for its services and he would be rewarded with
                        large bonuses for helping the firm increase its investment banking fees. Some clients
                        bought shares based on the analyst’s reports and suffered losses. They posted stories
                        on the internet about their losses and the misleading nature of the reports. When
                        the media investigated and published the story, the firm’s reputation for investment
                        research suffered. Investors began to question the firm’s motives and the objectivity of
                        its research recommendations. The firm’s investment clients started to look elsewhere
                        for investment advice, and company clients begin to transfer their business to firms
                        with untarnished reputations. With business declining, management is forced to trim
                        staff. Along with many other hard-working colleagues, you lose your job—through
                        no fault of your own.
                             Imagine how you would feel in this situation. Most people would feel upset and
                        resentful that their hard and honest work was derailed by someone else’s unethical
                        behavior. Yet, this type of scenario is not uncommon. Around the world, unsuspecting
                        employees at such companies as SAC Capital, Stanford Financial Group, Everbright
                        Securities, Enron, Satyam Computer Services, Arthur Andersen, and other large com-
                        panies have experienced such career setbacks when someone else’s actions destroyed
                        trust in their companies and industries.
                             Businesses and financial markets thrive on trust—defined as a strong belief in the
                        reliability of a person or institution. In a 2016 study on trust, investors indicated that
                        to earn their trust, the top two attributes of an investment manager should be that it
                        (1) has transparent and open business practices, and (2) has ethical business practices.1
                        Although these attributes are valued by customers and clients in any industry, this
                        reading will explore why they are of particular importance to the investment industry.
                             People may think that ethical behavior is simply about following laws, regulations,
                        and other rules, but throughout our lives and careers we will encounter situations in
                        which there is no definitive rule that specifies how to act, or the rules that exist may be
                        unclear or even in conflict with each other. Responsible people, including investment
                        professionals, must be willing and able to identify potential ethical issues and create
                        solutions to them even in the absence of clearly stated rules.

ETHICS

              explain ethics

Through our individual actions, each of us can affect the lives of others. Our decisions
and behavior can harm or benefit a variety of stakeholders—individuals or groups
of individuals who could be affected either directly or indirectly by a decision and
thus have an interest, or stake, in the decision. Examples of stakeholders in decisions
made by investment industry professionals include our colleagues, our clients, our
employers, the communities in which we live and work, the investment profession,
trade associations, regulators, and other financial market participants. In some cases,
our actions may benefit all of these stakeholder groups; in other cases, our actions
may benefit only some stakeholder groups; and in still other cases, our actions may
benefit some stakeholder groups and harm others. For example, recall the research
analyst in the introduction who wrote misleading research reports with the aim of
increasing the financial benefit to himself and his employer. In the very short term,
his conduct seemed to directly benefit some stakeholders (certain clients, himself,
and his employer) and to harm other stakeholders (clients who invested based on his
reports). Over a longer time period, his conduct resulted in harm to himself and many
other stakeholders—his employer, his employer’s clients, his colleagues, investors,
and through loss of trust when the story was published, the larger financial market.
    Ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide
guidance for our behavior. The word “ethics” comes from the Greek word “ethos,”
meaning character, used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals characterizing a
society or societal group. Beliefs are assumptions or thoughts we hold to be true. A
principle is defined as a belief or fundamental truth that serves as the foundation for
a system of belief or behavior or a chain of reasoning. Our beliefs form our values—
those things we deem to have worth or merit.
    Moral principles or ethical principles are beliefs regarding what is good, accept-
able, or obligatory behavior and what is bad, unacceptable, or forbidden behavior.
Ethical principles may refer to beliefs regarding behavior that an individual expects of
himself or herself, as well as shared beliefs regarding standards of behavior expected
or required by a community or societal group.
    The study of ethics examines the role of consequences and personal character in
defining what is considered good, or ethical, conduct.
    Ethical conduct is behavior that follows moral principles and balances self-interest
with both the direct and the indirect consequences of the behavior on others. Ethical
actions are those actions that are perceived as beneficial and conforming to the ethi-
cal expectations of society. An action may be considered beneficial if it improves the
outcomes or consequences for stakeholders affected by the action. Telling the truth
about the risks or costs associated with a recommended investment, for example, is
an ethical action—that is, one that conforms to the ethical expectations of society in
general and clients in particular. Telling the truth is also beneficial; telling the truth
builds trust with customers and clients and enables them to make more informed
decisions, which should lead to better outcomes for them and higher levels of client/
customer satisfaction for you and your employer.
    Widely acknowledged ethical principles include honesty, transparency, fairness
or justice, diligence, and respect for the rights of others. Most societal groups share
these fundamental ethical principles and build on them, establishing a shared set of
rules regarding how members should behave in certain situations. The principles or
rules may take different forms depending on the community establishing them.

                             Governments and related entities, for example, may establish laws and/or regula-
                        tions to reflect widely shared beliefs about obligatory and forbidden conduct. Laws and
                        regulations are rules of conduct specified by a governing body, such as a legislature
                        or a regulator, identifying how individuals and entities under its jurisdiction should
                        behave in certain situations. Most countries have laws and regulations governing the
                        investment industry and the conduct of its participants. Differences in laws may reflect
                        differences in beliefs and values.
                             In some countries, for example, the law requires that an investment adviser act in
                        the best interests of his or her clients. Other countries require that investment pro-
                        fessionals recommend investments that are suitable for their clients. These differing
                        requirements can also hold true within one country where some advisers are held to
                        a suitability standard and others to the fiduciary standard of the client’s best interests.
                        Investment advisers and portfolio managers who are required by law to act in their
                        clients’ best interests must always put their clients’ interests ahead of their own or
                        their employers’ interests. An investment adviser who is required by law to act in a
                        client’s best interest must understand the client’s financial objectives and risk tolerance,
                        research and investigate multiple investment opportunities, and recommend the invest-
                        ment or investment portfolio that is most suitable for the client in terms of meeting
                        his or her long-term financial objectives. In addition, the investment adviser would
                        be expected to monitor the client’s financial situation and investments to ensure that
                        the investments recommended remain the best overall option for meeting the client’s
                        long-term financial objectives. In countries with only a suitability requirement, it is
                        legal for investment professionals to recommend a suitable investment to a client even
                        if other, similar suitable investments with lower fees are available. These differences
                        in laws reflect differences in beliefs and values.
                             Specific communities or societal groups in which we live and work sometimes cod-
                        ify their beliefs about obligatory and forbidden conduct in a written set of principles,
                        often called a code of ethics. Universities, employers, and professional associations
                        often adopt a code of ethics to communicate the organization’s values and overall
                        expectations regarding member behavior. The code of ethics serves as a general
                        guide for how community members should act. Some communities will also expand
                        on their codes of ethics and adopt explicit rules or standards that identify specific
                        behaviors required of community members. These standards of conduct serve as
                        benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members and can
                        help clarify the code of ethics. Members can choose behaviors that demonstrate even
                        higher standards. By joining the community, members are agreeing to adhere to the
                        community’s code of ethics and standards of conduct. To promote their code of ethics
                        and reduce the incidence of violations, communities frequently display their codes in
                        prominent locations and in written materials. In addition, most communities require
                        that members commit to their codes in writing on an annual or more frequent basis.
                             Violations of a community’s established code of ethics and/or standards of con-
                        duct can harm the community in a variety of ways. Violations have the potential to
                        damage the community’s reputation among external stakeholders and the general
                        public. Violations can also damage the community’s reputation internally and lead to
                        reduced trust among community members and can cause the organization to fracture
                        or splinter from within. To protect the reputation of its membership and limit potential
                        harm to innocent members, the community may take corrective actions to investigate
                        possible violations, repair any damages, and attempt to discipline the violator or, in
                        severe cases, revoke the violator’s membership in the community.

EXAMPLE 1

  Ethics

  1. Which of the following statements is most accurate? Ethics can be described
     as:
      A. a commitment to upholding the law.
      B. an individual’s personal opinion about right and wrong.
      C. a set of moral principles that provide guidance for our behavior.
  Solution:
     C is correct. Ethics can be described as a set of moral principles that provide
     guidance for our behavior; these may be moral principles shared by a com-
     munity or societal group.

  2. Which of the following statements is most accurate? Standards of conduct:
      A. are a necessary component of any code of ethics.
      B. serve as a general guide regarding proper conduct by members of a
         group.
      C. serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior required of
         members of a group.
  Solution:
     C is correct. Standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally
     acceptable behavior required of members of a group. Some organizations
     will adopt only a code of ethics, which communicates the organization’s
     values and overall expectations regarding member behavior. Others may
     adopt both a code of ethics and standards of conduct. Standards of conduct
     identify specific behavior required of community members and serve as
     benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members.

A profession is an occupational community that has specific education, expert
knowledge, and a framework of practice and behavior that underpins community
trust, respect, and recognition. Most professions emphasize an ethical approach, the
importance of good service, and empathy with the client.
    Professions have grown in size and number over the last century: the rise of new
specialist areas of expertise has created new professions. Driving forces of a new
profession include governments and regulators, which encourage the formation of an

                        ethical relationship between professionals and society at large. There is also demand
                        for professions from individuals who see an advantage in working as a professional
                        and from clients who desire to work with professionals.
                            Professions have not developed in every country. But in most countries, those
                        who work in specialized areas—such as doctors, lawyers, actuaries, accountants,
                        architects, and engineers—are subject to some combination of licensed status and
                        technical standards. These standards distinguish professions from the craft guilds and
                        trade bodies that were established in many countries. In particular, the requirement
                        for members of professions to uphold high ethical standards is one clear difference.
                        Another difference is that trade bodies do not normally have a mission to serve society
                        or to set and enforce professional conduct rules for practitioners.


                        How Professions Establish Trust
                        For a profession to be credible, a primary goal is to establish trust among clients
                        and among society in general. In doing so, professions have a number of common
                        characteristics that, when combined, greatly increase confidence and credibility in
                        professionals and their organizations.

                        Professions normalize practitioner behavior.
                        Professionalism is underpinned by codes and standards developed by professional
                        bodies. Regulators typically support professional ethics and recognize the frame-
                        work for ethics that professions can provide. Many regulators around the world have
                        engaged closely with professional bodies to understand their codes and standards, as
                        well as how they are enforced. Codes and standards developed by practitioners can
                        be complementary to regulations, codifying many more individual practices than the
                        high-level principles set by regulation.
                            Many governments have recognized that a profession can develop a more sophis-
                        ticated system of standards than a regulator can, via continuous practitioner input
                        and a strong mutual interest within the profession to maintain good standards and
                        adopt best practices. Government support of professions is attributable to the role
                        of professions in helping the public and ensuring expert and principled performance
                        of complex services.

                        Professions provide a service to society.
                        There is an obligation for professionals to go beyond codes and standards. Professionals
                        should advocate for higher educational and ethical standards in the industry, indi-
                        vidually and through their companies. Professions can widen access to services and
                        support economic activity by encouraging trust in the industries they serve. Professions
                        have realized that earning community trust not only creates professional pride and
                        acceptance but also delivers commercial benefits. A profession that earns trust may
                        ultimately have greater flexibility and independence from government regulators to
                        manage its own affairs, which allows members of the profession to develop service
                        models that are both useful to clients and beneficial to members.

                        Professions are client focused.
                        An integral part of a profession’s mission is to develop and administer codes, best
                        practice guidelines, and standards that guide an industry. These codes, standards, and
                        guidelines help ensure that all professionals place the integrity of their profession and
                        the interests of clients above their own personal interests. At a minimum, professionals
                        must act in the best interest of the client, exercising a reasonable level of care, skill,
                        and diligence. The obligation to deliver a high standard of care when acting for the

regulators, trade associations, and not-for-profit organizations, may also support
an industry but are not the same as professional bodies. Unlike professions, these
other entities generally do not exist to set and maintain professional standards. Most
employers encourage employees to be members of relevant professions, and many give
financial support for this membership to ideally improve the quality of client service
and reinforce ethical awareness.

Professions have high entry standards.
Membership in a profession is a signal to the market that the professional will deliver
high-quality service of a promised standard, going beyond simply academic creden-
tials. Professions develop curricula that equip future professionals with competence,
including technical skills, knowledge, and ethics.

Professions possess a body of expert knowledge.
A repository of knowledge, developed by experienced and skilled practitioners, is
made available to all members of a profession. This knowledge helps members work
effectively and ethically and is based on best practice.

Professions encourage and facilitate continuing education.
Entry into a profession does not, on its own, guarantee that an individual will main-
tain competency and continue to uphold professional standards. After qualification
and throughout the working life of a professional, there will be changes in knowledge
and technical skills to perform certain jobs, in technology and standards of ethical
behavior, in services that can be offered, and in the legal and business environment
in which professional services are delivered. These all require the development of
competence and ethical awareness. Most professional bodies make it a condition of
membership that a specific amount of new learning is undertaken each year. Typically,
such conditions specify a time commitment, which may be separated into different
competencies and types of learning activity. This is often referred to as continuing
professional development and is seen as an important part of maintaining professional
standards. The training and education that professionals undertake increase the value
of human capital, which can contribute to economic growth and social mobility.

Professions monitor professional conduct.
Members of a profession must be held accountable for their conduct to maintain the
integrity and reputation of an industry. Doing so often involves self-regulation by
professional bodies through monitoring and imposition of sanctions on members.

Professions are collegial.
Professionals should be respectful to each other, even when they are competing. At
the very least, they must respect the rights, dignity, and autonomy of others.

Professions are recognized oversight bodies.
Many professional bodies are not-for-profit organizations with a mission emphasizing
excellence, integrity, and public service. Although it is the responsibility of individual
professionals to remain competent, an oversight body typically monitors this responsi-
bility. Such bodies provide individuals with ongoing educational resources and access
to information about changes in standards and imposes a framework of discipline.
Continuing membership indicates sustained competence in (and updating of ) prac-
tical skills while maintaining ongoing compliance with an ethical code of conduct.

                         Professions encourage the engagement of members.
                         Participation by members as volunteers is part of the essence of a profession.
                         Professionals are more likely to refer to, use, and adhere to values that they have
                         helped develop, and they typically have the power as members to revise these values.
                         A good professional will want to mentor and inspire others who recently entered or
                         wish to enter the profession. Professionals should be willing to volunteer to advance
                         the profession and engage with peers to develop expertise and ethics. Professionals
                         should volunteer to help educate new generations in ethical knowledge and ethical
                         decision making and to foster a productive debate about new areas of ethics. Most
                         professionals find that the experience of volunteering within the profession enhances
                         their skills and widens their contacts within the industry. Membership in a professional
                         body allows the necessary engagement with other professionals.


                         Professions Are Evolving
                         No profession stands still. Such trends as greater transparency and public account-
                         ability force professions to adapt to change. Meanwhile, technology opens up pos-
                         sibilities for new services and different ways of working. In addition, key processes
                         of a profession’s responsibilities may need to be reviewed by a government agency
                         or independent public body. In general, professions often engage with non-member
                         individuals. This can help a profession evaluate the viewpoints of the public, clients,
                         or other stakeholders when determining policy and practice and can encourage public
                         trust for a profession’s conduct and disciplinary process.
                             Effective professions continue to develop their role to account for changing best
                         practices. Some medical professional bodies, for instance, have been established for
                         more than 500 years but may now have the same need to adapt as the much younger
                         investment management profession. This means that at any point in time, society
                         may recognize an area of work as a profession even if it has not fully or universally
                         implemented all the expectations. As the requirements for a profession evolve, gaps
                         open up that may take time to remedy. Effective professions also actively learn from
                         other professions, particularly in the area of ethics. New standards of conduct in the
                         accounting profession might be an influence on standards considered in investment
                         management, for example.


                         Professionalism in Investment Management
                                Successful investing professionals are disciplined and consistent and they
                                think a great deal about what they do and how they do it.
                                —Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (1949)

                         Investment management is a relatively young profession, which means that public
                         understanding of its practice and codes is still developing. Recognition by regulators
                         and employers also lags established professions. Not everyone engaged in investment
                         management is a professional; some practitioners have not undertaken specific invest-
                         ment training or are not members of a professional body. That creates a challenge for
                         the investment management profession to gain trust, because not all practitioners need
                         to be committed to high ethical standards. However, key elements of the profession
                         have been steadily established over several decades. For example, the publication of
                         Graham and Dodd’s Security Analysis in 1934 was an important step in establishing
                         a body of knowledge for investment.
                             The investment management profession meets most, but currently not all, of the
                         expectations of a profession. In most countries, some form of certification or licensing
                         is needed to practice, but there may not be a requirement to join a professional body.

Ethics and Professionalism                                                                                   11


Globally, the trend is to require examined entry to practice investment management
and to maintain competence. But few professions have perfect implementation of
all the expected attributes. The investment management profession, similar to other
professions, is on a journey to improve implementation and keep up with changing
demands.
     The investment management profession has become increasingly global as capital
markets have opened up around the world. Investment management professionals
may seek cross-border opportunities or may need to relocate between offices within
multinational asset management firms. Regulatory coordination across borders and the
emergence of technology are contributing factors to this globalization of investment
management. Various investment management professional bodies have developed
in individual countries, and several of these bodies have expanded internationally.
In addition, several other professional bodies, including those focused on actuarial
and accountancy services, have investment management professionals as members.


Trust in Investment Management
The investment management professional today has similarities with professionals
in longer-established professions, such as medicine and law. Like doctors and law-
yers, investment management professionals are trusted to draw on a body of formal
knowledge and apply that knowledge with care and judgement. In comparison to
clients, investment professionals are also expected to have superior financial expertise,
technical knowledge, and knowledge of the applicable laws and regulations. There is
a risk that clients may not be fully aware of the conflicts, risks, and fees involved, so
investment management professionals must always handle and fully disclose these
issues in a way that serves the best interests of clients. Compliance with codes of
ethics and professional standards is essential, and practice must be guided by care,
transparency, and integrity.
    The investment management profession and investment firms must be interde-
pendent to maintain trust. Employers and regulators have their own standards and
practices that may differ from regulations and standards set by professional bodies.
The investment management professional bodies typically direct professionals in how
to resolve these differences.
    In many developed economies, the investment management profession affects
many key aspects of the economy, including savings, retirement planning, and the
pricing and allocation of capital. In most countries, skilled evaluation of securities
leads to more efficient capital allocation and, combined with ethical corporate gover-
nance, can assist in attracting investment from international investors. The investment
management profession can deliver more value to society when higher levels of trust
and better capital allocation reduce transaction costs and help meet client objectives.
These reasons explain why practitioners, clients, regulators, and governments have
supported the development of an investment management profession.


CFA Institute as an Investment Management Professional Body
CFA Institute is the largest body for investment management professionals.2 Reflecting
the globalization of investment management, CFA Institute moved beyond North
America in the 1980s. CFA Institute initiated a number of other changes in line with
the growth of investment management. One significant change occurred in 2015,
when CFA Institute decided to implement the highest standards of governance in the

                         US not-for-profit sector. The Board of Governors resolved “to implement US Public
                         Company Standards and US not-for-profit leading practices, unless the Board deter-
                         mines that it is not in the best interest of the membership or organization to do so.”
                             The mission of CFA Institute is “to lead the investment profession globally, by
                         promoting the highest standards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for
                         the ultimate benefit of society.” The CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of
                         Professional Conduct (Code and Standards) promote the integrity of charterholders
                         and establish a model for ethical behavior. CFA Institute candidates and charterholders
                         must meet the highest standards among those established by CFA Institute, regulators,
                         or the employer. If candidates and charterholders do not meet these standards, there
                         are negative consequences. Where client interests and market interests conflict, the
                         Code and Standards set an investment management professional’s duty to market
                         integrity as the overriding obligation. The advocacy efforts of CFA Institute aim to build
                         market integrity by calling for regulations that align the interests of firms and clients.
                             As a professional body, CFA Institute gathers knowledge from practicing investment
                         professionals, conducts rigorous examinations, and ensures practitioner involvement
                         in developing its codes and values. The CFA Institute Global Body of Investment
                         Knowledge (GBIK) and Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK) are updated on an
                         ongoing basis through a process known as practice analysis. Through interactions with
                         practicing investment management professionals, practice analysis helps ensure that
                         the body of knowledge for the investment management profession remains current and
                         globally relevant. The CFA Program ensures that candidates have sufficiently mastered
                         the core knowledge, skills, and abilities (competencies) necessary that are generally
                         accepted and applied by investment professionals. CFA Institute also contributes to
                         the dissemination of new research and ideas in finance with the publication of the
                         Financial Analysts Journal; CFA Institute Research Foundation books, research briefs,
                         and reviews; and CFA Institute Magazine.
                             CFA Institute encourages charterholders to engage in their professional com-
                         munities and involves charterholders in its initiatives. CFA Institute local societies
                         keep charterholders connected and engaged in their communities. CFA Institute
                         assists local societies with providing continuing education programs and events that
                         facilitate charterholders engagement. For CFA charterholders, a local CFA society
                         is an important route to maintaining professionalism, particularly for continuing
                         professional development.
                             CFA charterholders and CFA Program candidates are required to adhere to the
                         Code and Standards and to sign annually a statement attesting to that continued
                         adherence. Charterholders and candidates must maintain and improve their pro-
                         fessional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other
                         investment professionals.

                            1. Which of the following statements is most accurate? Investment profession-
                               als have a special responsibility to act ethically because:
                                A. the industry is heavily regulated.
                                B. they are entrusted to protect clients’ assets.
                                C. the profession requires compliance with its code of ethics.
                            Solution:
                               B is correct. Investment professionals have a special responsibility because
                               clients entrust them to protect the clients’ assets.

   2. Which of the following statements best completes the following sentence?
      Professionals use their specialized knowledge and skills:
      A. in service to others.
      B. to advance their career.
      C. for the exclusive benefit of their employers.
   Solution:
      A is correct. Professionals use specialized knowledge and skills in service to
      others. Their career and employer may benefit, but those results are not the
      primary focus of a professional’s use of his or her specialized knowledge and
      skills.

   3. Which of the following statements is most accurate? A profession’s code of
      ethics:
      A. includes standards of conduct or specific benchmarks for behavior.
      B. ensures that all members of a profession will act ethically at all times.
      C. publicly communicates the shared principles and expected behaviors
         of a profession’s members.
   Solution:
      C is correct. A profession’s code of ethics publicly communicates the shared
      principles and expected behaviors of a profession’s members. The existence
      of a code of ethics does not ensure that all members will behave in a manner
      consistent with the code and act ethically at all times. A profession will often
      establish a disciplinary process to address alleged violations of the code of
      ethics. A profession may adopt standards of conduct to enhance and clarify
      the code of ethics.




CHALLENGES TO ETHICAL CONDUCT
                                                                                             4
               identify challenges to ethical behavior

Professionals generally aim to be responsible and to adhere to high moral standards, so
what is the benefit of studying ethics? Throughout our careers, we may find ourselves
in difficult or at least unfamiliar situations in which an appropriate course of action is
not immediately clear and/or there may be more than one seemingly acceptable choice;
studying ethics helps us prepare for such situations. This section addresses challenges
to engaging in ethical conduct. Failure to acknowledge, understand, or consider these
challenges can lead to poor decision making, resulting in unintentional consequences,
such as unethical conduct and potential violations of the Code and Standards.
    Several challenges can make adherence to ethical conduct difficult. First, people
tend to believe that they are ethical people and that their ethical standards are higher
than average. Of course, everyone cannot be above average. However, surveys show
this belief in above averageness remains.
    These survey results illustrate overconfidence, a common behavioral bias that can
lead to faulty decision making. Studies have shown that our beliefs and emotions fre-
quently interfere with our cognitive reasoning and result in behavioral bias, a tendency

                         to behave in a way that is not strictly rational. As a result of the overconfidence bias,
                         we are more likely to overestimate the morality of our own behavior, particularly
                         in situations that we have not faced before. The overconfidence bias can result in a
                         failure to consider, explicitly or implicitly, important inputs and variables needed to
                         form the best decision from an ethical perspective. In general, the overconfidence bias
                         leads us to place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations,
                         such as “I’m honest and would not lie,” even though studies have shown that internal
                         traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave
                         ethically in a given situation.
                             A second challenge is that decision makers often fail to recognize and/or signifi-
                         cantly underestimate the effect of situational influences, such as what other people
                         around them are doing. Situational influences are external factors, such as environ-
                         mental or cultural elements, that shape our thinking, decision making, and behavior.
                         Social psychologists have studied how much situational influences affect our behavior
                         and have found that even good people with honorable motives can and often will be
                         influenced to do unethical things when put into difficult situations. Experiments have
                         shown that even people who consider themselves strong, independent, free thinkers
                         will conform to social pressures in many situations. The bystander effect, for example,
                         demonstrates that people are less likely to intervene in an emergency when others
                         are present. Fortunately, experiments have also shown that situational influences can
                         induce people to act more ethically. For example, people tend to behave more ethically
                         when they think someone else is watching or when there is a mirror placed close to
                         them. The important concept to understand is that situational influences have a very
                         powerful and often unrecognized effect on our thinking and behavior. Thus, learning
                         to recognize situational influences is critical to making good decisions.
                             Common situational influences in the investment industry that can shape think-
                         ing and behavior include money and prestige. One experiment found that simply
                         mentioning money can reduce ethical behavior. In the experiment, participants were
                         less likely to cooperate when playing a game if the game was called the Wall Street
                         Game, rather than the Community Game. In the investment industry, large financial
                         rewards—including individual salaries, bonuses, and/or investment gains—can induce
                         honest and well-intentioned individuals to act in ways that others might not consider
                         ethical. Large financial rewards and/or prestige can motivate individuals to act in their
                         own short-term self-interests, ignoring possible short-term risks or consequences to
                         themselves and others as well as long-term risks or consequences for both themselves
                         and others. Another extremely powerful situational influence is loyalty. Loyalty to
                         supervisors or organizations, fellow employees, and other colleagues can tempt indi-
                         viduals to make compromises and take actions that they would reject under different
                         situational influences or judge harshly when taken by others.
                             Situational influences often blind people to other important considerations.
                         Bonuses, promotions, prestige, and loyalty to employer and colleagues are examples
                         of situational influences that frequently have a disproportionate weight in our decision
                         making. Our brains more easily and quickly identify, recognize, and consider these
                         short-term situational influences than longer-term considerations, such as a commit-
                         ment to maintaining our integrity and contributing to the integrity of the financial
                         markets. Although absolutely important, these long-term considerations often have
                         less immediate consequences than situational influences, making them less obvious
                         as factors to consider in a decision and, therefore, less likely to influence our overall
                         decision making. Situational influences shift our brain’s focus from the long term to
                         the short or immediate term. When our decision making is too narrowly focused
                         on short-term factors and/or self-interest, we tend to ignore and/or minimize the
                         longer-term risks and/or costs and consequences to ourselves and others, and the
                         likelihood of suffering ethical lapses and making poor decisions increases.

    Loyalty to employer and/or colleagues is an extremely powerful situational influence.
Our colleagues can influence our thinking and behavior in both positive and negative
ways. For example, colleagues may have encouraged you to signal your commitment
to your career and high ethical standards by enrolling in the CFA Program. If you
work for or with people who are not bound by the Code and Standards, they might
encourage you to take actions that are consistent with local law, unaware that the
recommended conduct falls short of the Code and Standards.
    Well-intentioned firms may adopt or develop strong compliance programs to
encourage adherence to rules, regulations, and policies. A strong compliance policy
is a good start to developing an ethical culture, but a focus on adherence to rules
may not be sufficient. A compliance approach may not encourage decision makers
to consider the larger picture and can oversimplify decision making. Taken to the
extreme, a strong compliance culture can become another situational influence that
blinds employees to other important considerations. In a firm focused primarily on
compliance, employees may adopt a “check the box” mentality rather than an ethical
decision-making approach. Employees may ask the question “What can I do?” rather
than “What should I do?”

EXAMPLE 3

   Challenges to Ethical Conduct

   1. Which of the following will most likely determine whether an individual will
      behave unethically?
      A. The person’s character
      B. The person’s internal traits and intrinsic motivation
      C. External factors, such as environmental or cultural elements
   Solution:
      C is correct. Social psychologists have shown that even good people may
      behave unethically in difficult situations. Situational influences, which are
      external factors (e.g., environmental or cultural elements), can shape our
      thinking, decision making, and behavior and are more likely to lead to un-
      ethical behavior than internal traits or character.

   2. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
      A. Large financial rewards, such as bonuses, are the most powerful situa-
         tional influences.
      B. When decision making focuses on short-term factors, the likelihood of
         ethical conduct increases.
      C. Situational influences can motivate individuals to act in their short-
         term self-interests without recognizing the long-term risks or conse-
         quences for themselves and others.
   Solution:
      C is correct. Situational influences can motivate individuals to act in their
      short-term self-interests without recognizing the long-term risks or con-
      sequences for themselves and others. Large financial rewards are powerful
      situational influences, but in some situations, other situational influences,
      such as loyalty to colleagues, may be even more powerful.

             5           ETHICAL VS. LEGAL STANDARDS

                                       compare and contrast ethical standards with legal standards

                         Many times, stakeholders have common ethical expectations. Other times, different
                         stakeholders will have different perceptions and perspectives and use different criteria
                         to decide whether something is beneficial and/or ethical.
                              Laws and regulations often codify ethical actions that lead to better outcomes for
                         society or specific groups of stakeholders. For example, some laws and regulations
                         require businesses and their representatives to tell the truth. They require specific
                         written disclosures in marketing and other materials. Complying with such rules is
                         considered an ethical action; it creates a more satisfactory outcome that conforms to
                         stakeholders’ ethical expectations. As an example, consider disclosure requirements
                         mandated by securities regulators regarding the risks of investing. Complying with
                         such rules creates better outcomes for you, your clients, and your employer. First,
                         compliance with the rule reduces the risk that clients will invest in securities without
                         understanding the risks involved, which, in turn, reduces the risk that clients will file
                         complaints and/or take legal action if their investments decline in value. Complying
                         with the rules also reduces the risk that regulators will initiate an investigation, file
                         charges, or/and discipline or sanction you and/or your employer. Any of these actions
                         could jeopardize the reputation and future prospects of you and your employer. Conduct
                         that reduces these risks (e.g., following disclosure rules) would be considered ethical;
                         it leads to better outcomes for you, your clients, and your employer and conforms to
                         the ethical expectations of various stakeholders.
                              Although laws frequently codify ethical actions, legal and ethical conduct are not
                         always the same. Think about the diagram in Exhibit 1. Many types of conduct are
                         both legal and ethical, but some conduct may be one and not the other. Some legal
                         behaviors or activities may be considered unethical, and some behaviors or activi-
                         ties considered ethical may be deemed illegal in certain jurisdictions. Acts of civil
                         disobedience, such as peaceful protests, may be in response to laws that individuals
                         consider unethical. The act of civil disobedience may itself be considered ethical, and
                         yet it violates existing local laws.
                              The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but considered
                         by some to be unethical. Some countries, for example, do not have laws prohibiting
                         trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, but many investment
                         professionals and CFA Institute consider such trading unethical.
                              Another area in which ethics and laws may conflict is the area of “whistleblowing.”
                         Whistleblowing refers to the disclosure by an individual of dishonest, corrupt, or
                         illegal activity by an organization or government. Depending on the circumstances,
                         a whistleblower may violate organizational policies and even local laws with the dis-
                         closure; thus, a whistleblower’s actions may be deemed illegal and yet considered by
                         some to be ethical.

Some people advocate that increased regulation and monitoring of the behavior of
participants in the investment industry will increase trust in the financial markets.
Although this approach may work in some circumstances, the law is not always the
best mechanism to reduce unethical behavior for several reasons. First, laws typically
follow market practices; regulators may proactively design laws and regulations to
address existing or anticipated practices that may adversely affect the fairness and
efficiency of markets or reactively design laws and regulations in response to a crisis
or an event that resulted in significant monetary losses and loss of confidence/trust
in the financial system. Regulators’ responses typically take significant time, during
which the problematic practice may continue or even grow. Once enacted, a new law
may be vague, conflicting, and/or too narrow in scope. A new law may reduce or even
eliminate the existing activity while simultaneously creating an opportunity for a dif-
ferent, but similarly problematic, activity. Additionally, laws vary across countries or
jurisdictions, allowing questionable practices to move to places that lack laws relevant
to the questionable practice. Laws are also subject to interpretation and compliance
by market participants, who may choose to interpret the law in the most advanta-
geous way possible or delay compliance until a later date. For these reasons, laws and
regulations are insufficient to ensure the ethical behavior of investment professionals
and market participants.
    Ethical conduct goes beyond what is legally required and encompasses what dif-
ferent societal groups or communities, including professional associations, consider
to be ethically correct behavior. To act ethically, individuals need to be able to think
through the facts of the situation and make good choices even in the absence of
clear laws or rules. In many cases, there is no simple algorithm or formula that will
always lead to an ethical course of action. Ethics requires judgment—the ability to
make considered decisions and reach sensible conclusions. Good ethical judgment
requires actively considering the interests of stakeholders and trying to benefit mul-
tiple stakeholders—clients, family, colleagues, employers, market participants, and so
forth—and minimize risks, including reputational risk.

                            1. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
                                A. All legal behavior is ethical behavior.
                                B. Some ethical behavior may be illegal.
                                C. Legal standards represent the highest standard.
                            Solution:
                               B is correct. Some ethical behavior may be illegal. Civil disobedience is an
                               example of what may be illegal behavior that some consider to be ethical.
                               Legal and ethical behavior often coincide but not always. Standards of con-
                               duct based on ethical principles may represent a higher standard of behavior
                               than the behavior required by law.

                            2. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
                                A. Increased regulations are the most useful means to reduce unethical
                                   behavior by market participants.
                                B. Regulators quickly design and implement laws and regulations to
                                   address practices that adversely affect the fairness and efficiency of
                                   markets.
                                C. New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely
                                   affects the markets can create opportunities for different, but similarly
                                   problematic, conduct.
                            Solution:
                               C is correct. New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that ad-
                               versely affects the markets can create opportunities for different, but simi-

             6           ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKS

                                        describe a framework for ethical decision making

                         Laws, regulations, professional standards, and codes of ethics can guide ethical behav-
                         ior, but individual judgment is a critical ingredient in making principled choices and
                         engaging in appropriate conduct. One strategy to increase trust in the investment
                         industry is to increase the ability and motivation of market participants to act ethically
                         and help them minimize the likelihood of unethical actions. By integrating ethics into
                         the decision-making activities of employees, firms can enhance the ability and the
                         motivation of employees to act ethically, thereby reducing the likelihood of unethi-
                         cal actions. The ability to relate an ethical decision-making framework to a firm’s or
                         profession’s code of ethics allows investment professionals to bring the principles of
                         the code of ethics to life. An investment professional’s natural desire to “do the right
                         thing” can be reinforced by building a culture of integrity and accountability in the

workplace. Development, maintenance, and demonstration of a strong culture of
integrity within the firm by senior management may be the single most important
factor in promoting ethical behavior among the firm’s employees.
    Adopting a code that clearly lays out the ethical principles that guide the thought
processes and conduct the firm expects from its employees is a critical first step. But
a code of ethics, although necessary, is insufficient. Simply nurturing an inclination to
do right is no match for the multitude of daily decisions that investment professionals
make. We need to exercise ethical decision-making skills to develop the muscle memory
necessary for fundamentally ethical people to make good decisions despite the reality
of conflicts and our natural instinct for self-preservation. Just as coaching and practice
transform our natural ability to run across a field into the technique and endurance
required to run a race, teaching, reinforcing, and practicing ethical decision-making
skills prepare us to confront the hard issues effectively. It is good for business, indi-
viduals, firms, the industry, and the markets, as well as society as a whole, to engage
in the investment management profession in a highly ethical manner. A strong ethical
culture, built on a defined set of principles, that helps honest, ethical people engage
in ethical behavior will foster the trust of investors, lead to robust global financial
markets, and ultimately benefit society. That is why ethics matter.


The Framework for Ethical Decision-Making
When faced with decisions that can affect multiple stakeholders, investment profes-
sionals must have a well-developed set of principles; otherwise, their thought processes
can lead to, at best, indecision and, at worst, fraudulent conduct and destruction of
the public trust. Establishing an ethical framework to guide your internal thought pro-
cess regarding how to act is a crucial step to engaging in ethical conduct. Investment
professionals are generally comfortable analyzing and making decisions from an eco-
nomic (profit/loss) perspective. Given the importance of ethical behavior in carrying
out professional responsibilities, it is also important to analyze decisions and their
potential consequences from an ethical perspective. Using a framework for ethical
decision making will help investment professionals to effectively examine their choices
in the context of conflicting interests common to their professional obligations (e.g.,
researching and gathering information, developing investment recommendations, and
managing money for others). Such a framework will allow investment professionals
to analyze and choose options in a way that allows them to meet high standards of
ethical behavior. An ethical decision-making framework provides investment profes-
sionals with a tool to help them adhere to a code of ethics. By applying the framework
and analyzing the particular circumstances of each available alternative, investment
professionals are able to determine the best course of action to fulfill their responsi-
bilities in an ethical manner.
    An ethical decision-making framework will help a decision maker see the situation
from multiple perspectives and pay attention to aspects of the situation that may be
less evident with a short-term, self-focused perspective. The goal of getting a broader
picture of a situation is to be able to create a plan of action that is less likely to harm
stakeholders and more likely to benefit them. If a decision maker does not know or
understand the effects of his or her actions on stakeholders, the likelihood of making
a decision and taking action that harms stakeholders is more likely to occur, even if
unintentionally. Finally, an ethical decision-making framework helps decision makers
explain and justify their actions to a broader audience of stakeholders.
    Ethical decision-making frameworks are designed to facilitate the decision-making
process for all decisions. They help people look at and evaluate a decision from mul-
tiple perspectives, enabling them to identify important issues they might not oth-
erwise consider. Using an ethical decision-making framework consistently will help
you develop sound judgment and decision-making skills and avoid making decisions

                         that have unanticipated ethical consequences. Ethical decision-making frameworks
                         come in many forms with varying degrees of detail. A general ethical decision-making
                         framework is shown in Exhibit 2.

                             The ethical decision-making process includes multiple phases, each of which has
                         multiple components. The process is often iterative, and you, the decision maker, may
                         move between phases in an order different from what is presented. For simplicity, we
                         will discuss the phases sequentially. In the initial phase, you will want to identify the
                         important facts that you have available to you, as well as information that you may
                         not have but would like to have to give yourself a more complete understanding of
                         the situation. It is helpful to distinguish between facts and personal opinion, judge-
                         ments, and biases. You will also want to identify the stakeholders—clients, family,
                         colleagues, your employer, market participants, and so forth—and the duties you
                         have to each of them. You will then want to identify relevant ethical principles and/
                         or legal requirements that might apply to the situation. You should also identify any
                         potential conflicts of interest inherent in the situation or conflicts in the duties you
                         hold to others. For example, your duty to your client may conflict with your duty to
                         your employer.
                             In the second phase of ethical decision making, you will take time to consider
                         the situational influences as well as personal behavioral biases that could affect your
                         thinking and thus decision making. These situational influences and biases could
                         include a desire to please your boss, to be seen as successful by your peers and family,
                         to gain acceptance, to earn a large bonus, and so on. During this phase, you may seek
                         additional guidance from trusted sources—perhaps a family member, colleague, or
                         mentor who can help you think through the situation and help you identify and evaluate
                         alternative actions. You may turn to your compliance department for assistance or
                         you may even consult outside legal counsel. Seeking additional guidance is a critical
                         step in viewing the situation from different perspectives. You should seek guidance
                         from someone, possibly external to the firm, who is not affected by the same situa-
                         tional influences and behavioral biases as you are and can, therefore, provide a fresh
                         perspective. You should also seek guidance from your firm’s policies and procedures
                         and the CFA Institute Code and Standards. A helpful technique might be to imagine
                         how an ethical peer or role model might act in the situation.
                             The next phase of the framework is to make a decision and act. After you have
                         acted on your decision, you should take the time to reflect on and assess your deci-
                         sion and its outcome. Was the outcome what you anticipated? Why or why not? Had
                         you properly identified all the important facts, stakeholders, duties to stakeholders,
                         conflicts of interest, and relevant ethical principles? Had you considered the situa-
                         tional influences? Did you identify personal behavioral biases that might affect your
                         thinking? Had you sought sufficient guidance? Had you considered and properly
                         evaluated a variety of alternative actions? You may want to reflect on the decision
                         multiple times as the immediate and longer-term consequences of your decision and
                         actions become apparent.

Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks                                                         21


    The process is often iterative. After identifying the relevant facts and considering
situational influences, you may, for example, decide that you cannot make a decision
without more information. You may seek additional guidance on how to obtain the
information you need. You may also begin considering alternative actions regarding
how to proceed based on expectations of what the additional information will reveal,
or you may wait until you have more information, reflect on what you have done and
learned so far, and start the process over again. Sometimes cases can be complicated
and multiple iterations may reveal that no totally acceptable solution can be created.
Applying an ethical decision-making framework can help you evaluate the situation
so you can make the best possible decision. The next section shows applications of
the framework shown in Exhibit 2.


Applying the Framework
To illustrate how the framework could be applied in your career, consider the scenario
in Example 5.

EXAMPLE 5

  Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Framework I

  1. You have been hired as a junior analyst with a major investment bank.
     When you join the bank, you receive a copy of the firm’s policies as well as
     training on the policies. Your supervisor is the senior technology analyst for
     the investment bank. As part of your duties, you gather information, draft
     documents, conduct analysis, and perform other support functions for the
     senior analyst.

     Your employer is one of several investment banks working on the initial
     public offering (IPO) of a well-known technology company. The IPO is ex-
     pected to generate significant revenues for the investment banks participat-
     ing in the offering. The IPO has been highly anticipated and is in the news
     every day.

     You are thrilled when your supervisor asks you to work on several research
     projects related to analyzing and valuing the upcoming IPO for investors.
     You eagerly compile information and draft a one-page outline. You stop to
     consider what other information you could add to improve the report before
     proceeding. You realize that you have two excellent contacts in the tech-
     nology industry who could review your work and provide some additional
     and potentially valuable perspectives. You draft an email to your contacts
     reading:

       I am working on an analysis and valuation of Big Tech Company for inves-
       tors. My employer is one of the banks participating in the IPO, and I want
       to make sure I have considered everything. I was hoping you could give
       me feedback on the prospects and risks facing Big Tech. Please treat all
       the attached material as confidential.


     Before hitting the send button, you stop and think about the ethical deci-
     sion-making framework you have studied. You decide to apply the frame-
     work and jot down some notes as you work through the process: On the
     first page, you work through the identification phase and make a list of the

                                ■   Conflicts or potential conflicts of interest include the following:
                                    ●   Gathering additional research from external sources versus
                                        maintaining confidentiality

                                    ●   Duty to supervisor versus desire to impress

                                    ●   Duty to corporate client versus duty to other clients of the firm

                                    ●   The firm’s corporate client benefits from a high IPO price whereas
                                        the firm’s asset management clients would benefit from a low IPO

          ●   My bonus, compensation, and career prospects are tied to my
              supervisor’s and the IPO’s success; duty to employer, employer’s
              investing clients, profession

      ■   Ethical principles that are relevant to this situation include the
          following:
          ●   Duty of loyalty to employer

          ●   Client interests come first

          ●   Maintain confidences and confidentiality of information

          ●   Objectivity of analysis

          ●   Fairness to market participants


     On the next page, you write notes relating to the second phase of the frame-
     work, considering the various situational factors and the guidance available
     to you before considering alternative actions. These notes are shown in
     Exhibit 4.


     Exhibit 4: Consideration Phase

      ■   Situational influences:
          ●   The firm’s written policies

          ●   The bank will earn big fees from the IPO

          ●   I want to impress my boss—and potential future bosses

          ●   My bonus, compensation, and career prospects will be influenced
              by my contribution to the success of this deal and other deals

          ●   I am one of very few people working on this deal; it is a real
              honor, and others would be impressed that I am working on this
              deal

          ●   My employer is filled with successful and wealthy people who are
              go-getters; I want to be successful and wealthy like them

      ■   Additional guidance. I could seek guidance from the following:
          ●   The firm’s code of ethics

          ●   The firm’s written policies

          ●   A peer in my firm

          ●   My supervisor, the senior analyst

          ●   The compliance department

          ●   A mentor either at the firm or perhaps from university or
              industry

                                    ●   Outside legal counsel

                                ■   Alternative actions. I could consider the following:
                                    ●   Asking contacts what they have heard

                                    ●   Submitting the report as a draft and suggesting that contacts in
                                        the industry might be able to provide more perspective

                                    ●   Sending a survey to various technology industry veterans solicit-
                                        ing their viewpoints on developments


                               After completing these steps, you decide to check the firm’s policies. Un-
                               der a section entitled “Research Analyst Role in Securities Offerings,” the
                               manual states, “You may not distribute any written (which include email,
                               fax, electronic, and other means) material related to companies and/or their
                               offerings . . . during the course of any offering and the related quiet period.”

                               You read further and note a section entitled “Wall Crossing Policy and
                               Procedures” that states that “employees with confidential information may
                               not communicate the information to anyone who does not have a valid need
                               to know” without first obtaining clearance from the legal and compliance
                               department.

                               You decide that your contacts do not have a “valid need to know” and that it
                               is unlikely the firm’s legal and compliance professionals would approve shar-
                               ing the information. You then decide to mention your contacts to the senior
                               research analyst. He suggests that they may have some useful perspective
                               and that you might talk to them to hear their perspective and cautions you
                               not to disclose any information about any of the firm’s clients, pending
                               deals, or research. You return to your desk, delete the email, and following
                               the senior research analyst’s advice, call your contacts on the telephone to
                               discuss the technology sector, its prospects, and its challenges. During the
                               calls, you take care not to reveal any details about Big Tech Company or its
                               offering.
                               Whatever action you take, you should take time afterward to reflect on the
                               decision and the outcome. Was the outcome as anticipated? Why or why
                               not?

                             The initial facts presented in the example are based on the real-life experience of
                         a young junior analyst working on a highly anticipated IPO. The junior analyst may
                         or may not have used an ethical decision-making framework to evaluate his situation.
                         Without seeking additional guidance, the junior analyst sent an email similar to the
                         one in the example with an attachment that included confidential, proprietary infor-
                         mation, including the senior analyst’s analysis and forecasts. Months later, long after
                         the IPO offering, the junior analyst’s email was discovered by his employer. When
                         questioned, he admitted that he had received training regarding the firm’s policies
                         and that he did not discuss or seek approval from anyone before sending the email.
                         Two days later, the firm terminated the junior analyst’s employment and reported to
                         regulatory authorities that he had been terminated for distributing written materials,
                         by email, during a securities offering in violation of firm policies that prohibit the
                         dissemination of any written materials during the course of a securities offering and
                         related periods. The junior analyst’s supervisor also lost his job for failing to properly
                         supervise the analyst. Multiple regulators investigated the matter, and the firm was

Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks                                                           25


fined millions of dollars for failing to supervise its employees properly. The information
regarding the junior analyst’s termination was posted and remains available on the
regulator’s website for all to see. Future employers conducting routine background
checks will know that the analyst was terminated for violating firm policies relating
to a securities offering.
    The example presented is similar to situations faced by many analysts. Using an
ethical decision-making framework will help you evaluate situations from multiple
perspectives, avoid poor decision making, and avoid the consequences that can result
from taking an ill-conceived course of action. Using an ethical decision-making
framework is no guarantee of a positive outcome but may help you avoid making
unethical decisions.

EXAMPLE 6

   Applying an Ethical Decision-Making Framework II
   A financial adviser has been saving a portion of his salary to purchase a new
   vehicle. He is on track to have enough saved within the next three months. His
   employer has offered a special bonus for this quarter, which will go to the team
   that attracts the most new investors into the firm’s investment funds. In addi-
   tion to the potential bonus, the firm pays a 5% commission to employees who
   sell shares in the firm’s investment funds. Several of the funds are highly rated,
   including one designed to provide steady income to investors.
       The financial adviser has added only a few new investors to the firm’s funds,
   but his teammates have been very successful in their efforts. The end of the
   quarter is one week away, and his team is competing closely with another team
   for the bonus. One of his teammates informs the financial adviser that he really
   needs the bonus so his elderly mother can receive medical treatment.
       Later that day, the financial adviser meets with an elderly client on a limited
   income who is seeking more income from his investment portfolio. The client
   is 89 years old and in poor health. According to the client’s will, the client’s
   investment portfolio will go to his favorite charity upon his death.

   1. Which of the following situational influences is likely to have the most effect
      on the financial adviser’s efforts to get new clients to invest in the funds? His
      relationship with his:
      A. client.
      B. employer.
      C. teammates.
   Solution:
      C is correct. The financial adviser’s relationship with his teammates is likely
      to have the most effect on the financial adviser’s efforts. The teammates
      share in earning the bonus from the employer. In addition, the team works
      with each other on a regular basis where there is a likelihood that social
      influences of working together play a role in decision making and effort.

   2. Which of the following statements is most accurate? An ethical deci-
      sion-making framework:
      A. is only beneficial when a firm lacks a code of ethics.
      B. is used to improve compliance with laws and regulations.

                               the potential alternative actions and consequences of a decision.

                            3. Which of the following is most accurate? Ethical decision-making
                               frameworks:
                                A. raise awareness of different perspectives.
                                B. focus attention on short-term consequences.
                                C. allocate more weight to those who will directly benefit from the
                                   decision.
                            Solution:
                               A is correct. Ethical decision-making frameworks raise awareness of differ-
                               ent perspectives. The framework should consider short-term consequences,
                               but they are not the focus of the framework. Similarly, the framework may
                               allocate more weight to those who directly benefit from decisions, but this is
                               not the primary goal of an ethical decision-making framework.

                            4. Which of the following is most accurate? Ethical decision-making
                               frameworks:
                                A. are not needed if behavior is legal.
                                B. identify who gains the most from a decision.
                                C. can help reduce unanticipated ethical lapses and unexpected
                                   consequences.
                            Solution:
                               C is correct. Ethical decision-making frameworks can help avoid unantic-
                               ipated ethical consequences. As it relates to A, ethics standards are often
                               higher than legal standards so an ethical decision-making framework would
                               be needed. Although B is accurate, identifying who gains most from the
                               decision is a small component of the framework.

                            5. Using an ethical decision-making framework, which of the following duties
                               would most likely take precedence in the scenario described? The financial
                               adviser’s duty to his:
                                A. client.
                                B. employer.
                                C. colleagues.
                            Solution:
                               A is correct. Using an ethical decision-making framework, the financial ad-
                               viser’s relationship with his client would most likely take precedence in this
                               scenario. The adviser should put his client’s interests first. The exception to
                               client interests taking precedence occurs when market integrity effects take
                               precedence.

Conclusion                                                                                       27


   6. Using an ethical decision-making framework, the financial adviser would
      most likely:
        A. recommend that the elderly client invest at least some of his assets in
           the highly rated fund.
        B. research other investments that can provide steady income before
           making a recommendation to his elderly client.
        C. disclose the commission he would earn before recommending that the
           elderly client invest at least some of his assets in the highly rated fund.
   Solution:
        B is correct. Using an ethical decision-making framework, the financial
        adviser would identify the relevant facts, stakeholders, duties owed, and
        potential conflicts. In this scenario, the financial adviser owes a duty to his
        client as well as his employer. His client’s interests take precedence over all
        other interests. The bonus and his colleague’s desire to help his mother are
        situational influences. To navigate this situation, the financial adviser should
        seek additional information; he should research the risk and return parame-
        ters and fee structures of other investments that can provide steady income
        before making a recommendation to his client.




CONCLUSION
This reading introduced ideas and concepts that will help you understand the impor-
                                                                                             7
tance of ethical behavior in the investment industry as well as the challenges to adhering
to high ethical standards. A code of ethics will communicate an organization’s values
and the expected behavior of its members as well as provide guidance for decision
making. A code of ethics may be further enhanced and clarified by the adoption of
standards of conduct. Professions and professional organizations, such as the CFA
Institute, can help to establish codes and standards that provide a framework and
technical competence for practitioners. An ethical decision-making framework com-
bined with a code of ethics may help investment professionals analyze their decisions
in a way that identifies potential conflicts and negative consequences.
    Knowing the rules to apply in a particular situation, although important, may not
be sufficient to ensure ethical conduct if used alone. Responsible professionals in the
investment industry must be able both to recognize areas that are prone to ethical
pitfalls and to identify and process those circumstances and influences that can impair
judgment and lead to ethical lapses.




   SUMMARY
    ■    Ethics refers to the study of making good choices. Ethics encompasses a
         set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our
         behavior.
    ■    Situational influences are external factors that may shape our behavior.

                             ■   Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in our own
                                 morality, underestimating the effect of situational influences, and focusing
                                 on the immediate rather than long-term outcomes or consequences of a
                                 decision.
                             ■   In any given profession, the code of ethics publicly communicates the estab-
                                 lished principles and expected behavior of its members.
                             ■   Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills to serve
                                 others; they share and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics to serve
                                 others and advance the profession.
                             ■   A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members of the profes-
                                 sion will use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve their clients and
                                 others.
                             ■   A profession is an occupational group that has specific education, expert
                                 knowledge, and a framework of practice and behavior that underpins com-
                                 munity trust, respect, and recognition.
                             ■   The requirement to uphold high ethical standards is one clear difference
                                 between professions and craft guilds or trade bodies.
                             ■   A primary goal of professions is to establish trust among clients and among
                                 society in general.
                             ■   Common characteristics of professions include normalization of practi-
                                 tioner behavior, service to society, client focus, high entry standards, a body
                                 of expert knowledge, encouragement and facilitation of continuing educa-
                                 tion, monitoring of professional conduct, collegiality, recognized overseeing
                                 bodies, and encouragement of member engagement.
                             ■   The investment management profession has become increasingly global,
                                 driven by the opening of capital markets, coordination of regulation across
                                 borders, and the emergence of technology.
                             ■   Investment management professionals are trusted to draw on a body of
                                 formal knowledge and apply that knowledge with care and judgement. In
                                 comparison to clients, investment professionals are also expected to have
                                 superior financial expertise, technical knowledge, and knowledge of the
                                 applicable laws and regulations.
                             ■   As a professional body, CFA Institute gathers knowledge from practicing
                                 investment professionals, conducts rigorous examinations, and ensures
                                 practitioner involvement in developing its codes and values.
                             ■   Investment management professionals are likely to encounter dilemmas,
                                 including those with ethical implications. Professionals should consider
                                 carefully how to determine the facts of the issue and assess the implications.
                             ■   High ethical standards always matter and are of particular importance in the
                                 investment management profession, which is based almost entirely on trust.
                                 Clients trust investment professionals to use their specialized skills and
                                 knowledge to serve clients and protect client assets. All stakeholders gain
                                 long-term benefits when investment professionals adhere to high ethical
                                 standards.
                             ■   Legal standards are often rule based. Ethical conduct goes beyond legal
                                 standards, balancing self-interest with the direct and indirect consequences
                                 of behavior on others.
                             ■   A framework for ethical decision making can help people look at and evalu-
                                 ate a decision from different perspectives, enabling them to identify import-
                                 ant issues, make wise decisions, and limit unintended consequences.

                             B. focus exclusively on confirmable facts and relationships.

                             C. help avoid a decision that has unanticipated ethical consequences.

                         12. When an ethical dilemma occurs, an investment professional should most likely
                             first raise the issue with a:

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. Standards of conduct are applied to specific communities or societal
   groups and identify specific behaviors required of community members. These
   standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behav-
   ior of community members. Codes of ethics serve as a general guide for how
   community members should act; they communicate the organization’s values
   and overall expectations regarding member behavior, but they do not identify
   specific behaviors required of community members. Laws and regulations are
   rules of conduct defined by governments and related entities about obligatory
   and forbidden conduct broadly applicable for individuals and entities under their
   jurisdiction.

2. B is correct. A profession has several characteristics that distinguish it from an
   occupation or vocation, such as specialized knowledge and skills, service to oth-
   ers, and a code of ethics shared by its members. A profession is the ultimate evo-
   lution of an occupation, resulting from excellence in practice, a mastery mindest,
   and expected adherence to a code of ethics and standards of practice.

3. C is correct. Unethical behavior ultimately harms investment firms. Clients are
   not attracted if they suspect unethical behavior, leading to less business and low-
   er revenues. Investment firms may also experience higher relative costs because
   regulators are more likely to have cause to initiate costly investigations.

4. C is correct. High ethical standards distinguish professions from the craft guilds
   or trade bodies. Unlike trade bodies, professional bodies also typically have a
   mission to serve society and enforce professional conduct rules for practitioners.

5. B is correct. Fiduciary duty is an obligation to deliver a high standard of care
   when acting for the benefit of another party. Professionals must act in the best in-
   terest of the client, exercising a reasonable level of care, skill, and diligence. Other
   entities—including employers, regulators, trade associations, and not-for-profit
   bodies—may also support an industry but are not the same as professional
   bodies. Unlike professions, these other entities generally do not exist to set and
   maintain professional standards.

6. A is correct. An overconfidence bias can lead individuals to put too much impor-
   tance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations, such as their own perceptions
   of personal honesty, that can lead to faulty decision making. Loyalty to an em-
   ployer and promise of money or prestige are situational influences that can lead
   to faulty decision making.

7. B is correct. Consciously considering long-term consequences will help offset
   situational influences. We more easily recognize and consider short-term situa-
   tional influences than longer-term considerations because longer-term consider-
   ations have fewer immediate consequences than situational influences do. When
   decision making is too narrowly focused on short-term factors, we tend to ignore
   longer-term risks and consequences, and the likelihood of poor ethical decision
   making increases. A strong compliance policy is a good first step toward develop-
   ing an ethical culture; a focus on rules adherence may not be sufficient. Emphasis
   on compliance may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture
   and can oversimplify decision making. Taken to the extreme, a strong compliance
   culture can become another situational influence that blinds employees to other
   important considerations. An overconfidence bias can place too much impor-
   tance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations, such as “I’m honest and would

                             not lie,” even though studies have shown that internal traits are generally not the
                             main determinant of whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given
                             situation.

                         8. B is correct. A compliance approach can oversimplify decision making and may
                            not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture. A strong compli-
                            ance culture may be a good start in developing an ethical culture but can become
                            another situational influence that may result in employees failing to consider
                            other important factors.

                         9. C is correct. The investment management profession and investment firms must
                            be interdependent to maintain trust. Employers and regulators have their own
                            standards and practices, which may differ from regulations and standards set by
                            professional bodies.

                         10. B is correct. The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal
                             but that CFA Institute considers unethical. Trading while in possession of mate-
                             rial nonpublic information is not prohibited by law worldwide and can, therefore,
                             be legal, but CFA Institute considers such trading unethical.

                         11. C is correct. Using an ethical decision-making framework consistently will help
                             you develop sound judgment and decision-making skills and avoid making
                             decisions that have unanticipated ethical consequences. The decision-making
                             process is often iterative, and the decision maker may move between phases of
                             the framework. A decision maker should consider more than confirmable facts
                             and relationships; for example, the decision maker should consider situational
                             influences and personal biases.

                         12. C is correct. When a dilemma occurs, raising an issue internally with a senior
                             employee is often a good starting place and creates an opportunity for an inde-
                             pendent internal review. Protecting the client and the firm may take priority over
                             the position of an individual professional raising a concern.

PREFACE
                                                                                            1

              Program and the process for the enforcement of the Code and
              Standards

The Standards of Practice Handbook (Handbook) provides guidance to the people
who grapple with real ethical dilemmas in the investment profession on a daily basis;
the Handbook addresses the professional intersection where theory meets practice
and where the concept of ethical behavior crosses from the abstract to the concrete.
The Handbook is intended for a diverse and global audience: CFA Institute members
navigating ambiguous ethical situations; supervisors and direct/indirect reports
determining the nature of their responsibilities to each other, to existing and poten-
tial clients, and to the broader financial markets; and candidates preparing for the
Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) examinations.
    Events in global financial markets test the ethical mettle of financial market par-
ticipants, including CFA Institute members and candidates. The standards taught in
the CFA Program and by which CFA Institute members and candidates must abide
represent timeless ethical principles and professional conduct for all market conditions.
Through adherence to these standards, which continue to serve as the model for eth-
ical behavior in the investment profession globally, each market participant does his
or her part to improve the integrity and efficient operations of the financial markets.

                             The Handbook provides guidance for understanding the interconnectedness of
                         the aspirational and practical principles and provisions of the Code of Ethics and
                         Standards of Professional Conduct (Code and Standards). The Code contains high-level
                         aspirational ethical principles that drive members and candidates to create a positive
                         and reputable investment profession. The Standards contain practical ethical prin-
                         ciples of conduct that members and candidates must follow to achieve the broader
                         industry expectations. However, applying the principles individually may not capture
                         the complexity of ethical requirements related to the investment industry. The Code
                         and Standards should be viewed and interpreted as an interwoven tapestry of ethical
                         requirements. Through members’ and candidates’ adherence to these principles as a
                         whole, the integrity of and trust in the capital markets are improved.


                         Evolution of the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of
                         Professional Conduct
                         The Code and Standards are regularly reviewed and updated so that they remain effec-
                         tive and continue to represent the highest ethical standards in the global investment
                         industry. CFA Institute strongly believes that revisions of the Code and Standards are
                         undertaken not for cosmetic purposes but to add value by addressing legitimate con-
                         cerns and improving comprehension. In 2023, the CFA Institute Board of Governors
                         approved revisions to the Code and Standards that are fully described later in this
                         learning module.
                             Changes to the Code and Standards have far-reaching implications for the CFA
                         Institute membership, the CFA Program, and the investment industry as a whole. CFA
                         Institute members and candidates are required to adhere to the Code and Standards.
                         In addition, the Code and Standards are often adopted, in whole or in part, by firms
                         and regulatory authorities. Their relevance goes well beyond CFA Institute members
                         and candidates.


                         Standards of Practice Handbook
                         The periodic revisions of the Standards of Practice Handbook have come in conjunction
                         with updates of the Code and Standards. The Handbook is the fundamental element
                         of the ethics education effort of CFA Institute and the primary resource for guidance
                         in interpreting and implementing the Code and Standards. The Handbook seeks to
                         educate members and candidates on how to apply the Code and Standards to their
                         professional lives and thereby benefit their clients, employers, and the investing public
                         in general. The Handbook explains the purpose of the Code and Standards and how
                         they apply in a variety of situations. The sections discuss and amplify each standard
                         and suggest procedures for compliance.
                             Examples in the “Application of the Standard” sections are meant to illustrate how
                         the standard applies to hypothetical but factual situations. The names contained in the
                         examples are fictional and are not meant to refer to any actual person or entity. Unless
                         otherwise stated (e.g., one or more people are specifically identified), individuals in
                         each example are subject to the requirements of the Code and Standards. Because
                         factual circumstances vary so widely and often involve gray areas, the explanatory
                         material and examples are not intended to be all inclusive. Many examples set forth
                         in the application sections involve standards that have legal counterparts; members
                         are strongly urged to discuss with their supervisors and legal and compliance
                         departments the content of the Code and Standards and the members’ general
                         obligations under the Code and Standards.

Preface                                                                                     35


    CFA Institute recognizes that the presence of any set of ethical standards may
create a false sense of security unless the documents are fully understood, enforced,
and made a meaningful part of everyday professional activities. The Handbook is
intended to provide a useful frame of reference that outlines ethical professional
conduct for the organization’s members and candidates. The Handbook cannot cover
every contingency or circumstance, however, and it does not attempt to do so. The
development and interpretation of the Code and Standards are evolving processes;
the Code and Standards will be subject to continuing refinement.


Summary of the 2023 Revisions to the Code and Standards
In 2023, the CFA Institute Board of Governors revised the Standards of Professional
Conduct in three areas, resulting in the inclusion of one new standard and revisions
to two existing standards. The following is a summary of the changes:
   1. Within Standard I: Professionalism, the Board approved a new standard
      requiring members to act with and maintain the competence necessary to
      fulfill their professional responsibilities, thus reinforcing the principle set
      forth in the Code of Ethics.
   2. Within Standard V: Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions,
      the Board revised Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and
      Prospective Clients to require disclosures about the nature of the services
      provided by members and candidates and the costs to the client associated
      with those services.
   3. Within Standard VI: Conflicts of Interest, the Board changed the name of
      Standard VI(A) to “Standard VI(A) Avoid or Disclose Conflicts” and revised
      the standard to require members and candidates to either avoid conflicts
      of interest or disclose those conflicts. Previously, there was no mention of
      avoiding conflicts of interest in the standard.
   New guidance and examples have been added to the Handbook to fully explain
these new requirements.


New and Revised Standards of Professional Conduct

Competence Standard

   I. PROFESSIONALISM
   E. Competence
   Members and Candidates must:

      1. Act with and maintain the competence necessary to fulfill their profes-
         sional responsibilities.

Given the diverse range of professional services engaged in by members and candi-
dates, the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to successfully fulfill their role
will vary according to the nature of their professional duties. Over time, a member’s
role may expand, requiring new or different knowledge, skills, and abilities. Members
will develop and refine their skills and abilities throughout their professional careers.
Requiring members and candidates to act with and maintain appropriate levels of
competence will help ensure they provide a high standard of professional service for
their clients and employers.

36   Learning Module 2                                     Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct


                             Currently, the Code of Ethics requires members and candidates to “act with integrity,
                         competence, and diligence” and to “maintain and improve their professional compe-
                         tence and strive to improve the competence of other investment professionals.” This
                         new standard is consistent with and directly supports the requirements of the Code
                         of Ethics. Standard I(E) makes these requirements of the Code of Ethics more explicit
                         and emphasizes the need for members and candidates to continuously maintain or
                         improve the competence required by their professional position.
                             The skills and abilities necessary for members and candidates to successfully fulfill
                         their role vary according to the nature and complexity of their professional duties.
                         As a result, there will be different criteria for competence for different members. An
                         examination of the facts and circumstances of each member or candidate will dictate
                         their expected conduct under this standard.
                             Finally, Standard I(E) does not require members and candidates to engage in any
                         specific program of professional development or continuing education. There are a
                         variety of ways members and candidates can demonstrate and maintain competence
                         when engaging in their professional responsibilities.

                         Disclosure of Nature of Services and Costs to Client

                            V. INVESTMENT ANALYSIS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND
                            ACTIONS
                            B. Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients
                            Members and Candidates must:

                                1. Disclose to clients and prospective clients the nature of the services
                                   provided, along with information about the costs to the client associ-
                                   ated with those services.

                         A fundamental goal of the Code and Standards is to protect client interests and
                         allow clients to make fully informed decisions about their investments and financial
                         well-being. Providing clients with information about the nature of the services they
                         can expect from investment professionals and the financial impact they can expect
                         from those services is critical to achieving this goal. The disclosures required by this
                         new standard will permit clients to make informed decisions as to whether to engage
                         with the member or candidate and their firm.
                              Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients also requires
                         members to disclose the basic format and general principles of the investment pro-
                         cesses they use to analyze investments, select securities, and construct portfolios and
                         to promptly disclose any material changes to these processes. The associated financial
                         impact is an important part of the investment process but, until now, was not explic-
                         itly addressed as part of this disclosure. The revision to Standard V(B) fills this gap.

                         Revised Standard Relating to Conflicts

                            VI. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
                            Avoid or Disclose Conflicts
                            Members and Candidates must:

                                1. Avoid or make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could rea-
                                   sonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity and
                                   interfere with respective duties to their clients, prospective clients, and
                                   employer.

Preface                                                                                     37


      2. Ensure that such disclosures are prominent, are delivered in plain lan-
         guage, and communicate the relevant information effectively.

Standard VI(A) has always required members and candidates to disclose conflicts,
but previously, the language of the standard made no mention of avoiding conflicts.
Nevertheless, the guidance for Standard VI: Conflicts of Interest has long stated that
best practice is to avoid conflicts or the appearance of conflicts. Including the option
to avoid versus simply disclosing conflicts in the language of the standard emphasizes
that members and candidates should avoid conflicts of interest whenever reasonably
possible. While avoiding conflicts altogether is preferred, often in the investment
industry it may not be reasonable for members and candidates to avoid a conflict or
the perception of a conflict. When it is not reasonable for members and candidates
to avoid a conflict, Standard VI(A) continues to require clear and complete disclosure
of the conflict.


CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program
All CFA Institute members and candidates enrolled in the CFA Program are required
to comply with the Code and Standards. The CFA Institute Board of Governors main-
tains oversight and responsibility for the Professional Conduct Program (PCP), which,
in conjunction with the Disciplinary Review Committee (DRC), is responsible for
enforcement of the Code and Standards. The DRC is a volunteer committee of CFA
charterholders who serve on panels to review conduct and partner with Professional
Conduct staff to establish and review professional conduct policies. The CFA Institute
Bylaws and Rules of Procedure for Professional Conduct (Rules of Procedure) form
the basic structure for enforcing the Code and Standards. The Professional Conduct
division is also responsible for enforcing testing policies of other CFA Institute edu-
cation programs, as well as the professional conduct of Certificate in Investment
Performance Measurement (CIPM) certificants.
    Professional Conduct inquiries come from a number of sources. First, members
and candidates must self-disclose on the annual Professional Conduct Statement all
matters that question their professional conduct, such as involvement in civil litigation
or a criminal investigation or being the subject of a written complaint. Second, written
complaints received by Professional Conduct staff can bring about an investigation.
Third, CFA Institute staff may become aware of questionable conduct by a member
or candidate through the media, regulatory notices, or another public source. Fourth,
candidate conduct is monitored by proctors who complete reports on candidates
suspected to have violated testing rules on exam day. Lastly, CFA Institute may also
conduct analyses of scores and exam materials after the exam, as well as monitor online
and social media to detect disclosure of confidential exam information.
    When an inquiry is initiated, the Professional Conduct staff conducts an investiga-
tion that may include requesting a written explanation from the member or candidate;
interviewing the member or candidate, complaining parties, and third parties; and
collecting documents and records relevant to the investigation. Upon reviewing the
material obtained during the investigation, the Professional Conduct staff may con-
clude the inquiry with no disciplinary sanction, issue a cautionary letter, or continue
proceedings to discipline the member or candidate. If the Professional Conduct staff
believes a violation of the Code and Standards or testing policies has occurred, the
member or candidate has the opportunity to reject or accept any charges and the
proposed sanctions.

38   Learning Module 2                                     Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct


                             If the member or candidate does not accept the charges and proposed sanction,
                         the matter is referred to a panel composed of DRC members. Panels review materials
                         and presentations from Professional Conduct staff and from the member or candidate.
                         The panel’s task is to determine whether a violation of the Code and Standards or
                         testing policies occurred and, if so, what sanction should be imposed.
                             Sanctions imposed by CFA Institute may have significant consequences; they
                         include public censure, suspension of membership and use of the CFA designation,
                         and revocation of the CFA charter. Candidates enrolled in the CFA Program who have
                         violated the Code and Standards or testing policies may be suspended or prohibited
                         from further participation in the CFA Program.


                         Adoption of the Code and Standards
                         The Code and Standards apply to individual members of CFA Institute and candi-
                         dates in the CFA Program. CFA Institute does encourage firms to adopt the Code
                         and Standards, however, as part of their code of ethics. Those who claim compliance
                         should fully understand the requirements of each of the principles of the Code and
                         Standards.
                             Once a party—nonmember or firm—ensures its code of ethics meets the principles
                         of the Code and Standards, that party should make the following statement whenever
                         claiming compliance:
                                [Insert name of party] claims compliance with the CFA Institute Code of
                                Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct. This claim has not been
                                verified by CFA Institute.
                             CFA Institute welcomes public acknowledgement, when appropriate, that firms
                         are complying with the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional
                         Conduct. For firms that would like to distribute the Code and Standards to clients
                         and potential clients, attractive one-page copies of the Code and Standards, including
                         translations, are available on the CFA Institute website (www​.cfainstitute​.org).
                             CFA Institute has also published the Asset Manager Code, which is designed,
                         in part, to help asset managers comply with regulations mandating codes of ethics
                         for investment advisers. Whereas the Code and Standards are aimed at individual
                         investment professionals who are members of CFA Institute or candidates in the
                         CFA Program, the Asset Manager Code applies to firms. The Asset Manager Code
                         provides specific, practical guidelines for asset managers in six areas: loyalty to clients,
                         the investment process, trading, compliance, performance, and disclosure. The Asset
                         Manager Code and the appropriate steps to acknowledge compliance can be found
                         on the CFA Institute website (www​.cfainstitute​.org).


                         Acknowledgments
                         CFA Institute is a not-for-profit organization that is heavily dependent on the exper-
                         tise and intellectual contributions of member volunteers. Members devote their time
                         because they share a mutual interest in the organization’s mission to promote and
                         achieve ethical practice in the investment profession. CFA Institute owes much to the
                         volunteers’ abundant generosity and energy in extending ethical integrity.
                             The CFA Institute Standards of Practice Council (SPC), a group consisting of CFA
                         charterholder volunteers from many different countries, is charged with maintaining
                         and interpreting the Code and Standards and ensuring that they are effective. The SPC
                         draws its membership from a broad spectrum of organizations in the securities field,
                         including brokers, investment advisers, banks, and insurance companies.

    The SPC continually evaluates the Code and Standards, as well as the guidance in
the Handbook, to ensure that they are
   ■   representative of high standards of professional conduct,
   ■   relevant to the changing nature of the investment profession,
   ■   globally applicable,
   ■   sufficiently comprehensive, practical, and specific,
   ■   enforceable, and
   ■   testable for the CFA Program.
    Over the years, many volunteer members of the SPC have spent countless hours
reviewing and discussing revisions to the Code and Standards and updates to the
guidance that make up the Handbook. CFA Institute would like to thank all the cur-
rent and former members of the SPC who generously donated their time and energy
to this effort.




ETHICS AND THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY
Society ultimately benefits from efficient markets where capital can freely flow to
                                                                                            2
the most productive or innovative destination. Well-functioning capital markets
efficiently match those needing capital with those seeking to invest their assets in
revenue-generating ventures. In order for capital markets to be efficient, investors
must be able to trust that the markets are fair and transparent and offer them the
opportunity to be rewarded for the risk they choose to take. Laws, regulations, and
enforcement play a vital role but are insufficient alone to guarantee fair and trans-
parent markets. The markets depend on an ethical foundation to guide participants’
judgment and behavior. CFA Institute maintains and promotes the Code of Ethics
and Standards of Professional Conduct in order to create a culture of ethics for the
ultimate benefit of society.


Why Ethics Matters
Ethics can be defined as a set of moral principles or rules of conduct that provide
guidance for our behavior when it affects others. Widely acknowledged fundamental
ethical principles include honesty, fairness, diligence, and care and respect for others.
Ethical conduct follows those principles and balances self-interest with both the direct
and the indirect consequences of that behavior for other people.
    Not only does unethical behavior by individuals have serious personal
consequences—ranging from job loss and reputational damage to fines and even
jail—but unethical conduct from market participants, investment professionals, and
those who service investors can damage investor trust and thereby impair the sus-
tainability of the global capital markets as a whole. Unfortunately, there seems to be
an unending parade of stories bringing to light accounting frauds and manipulations,
Ponzi schemes, insider-trading scandals, and other misdeeds. Not surprisingly, this
has led to erosion in public confidence in investment professionals. Empirical evidence
from numerous surveys documents the low standing in the eyes of the investing public
of banks and financial services firms—the very institutions that are entrusted with
the economic well-being and retirement security of society.
    Governments and regulators have historically tried to combat misconduct in the
industry through regulatory reform, with various levels of success. Global capital
markets are highly regulated to protect investors and other market participants.

                         However, compliance with regulation alone is insufficient to fully earn investor trust.
                         Individuals and firms must develop a “culture of integrity” that permeates all levels
                         of operations and promotes the ethical principles of stewardship of investor assets
                         and working in the best interests of clients, above and beyond strict compliance with
                         the law. A strong ethical culture that helps honest, ethical people engage in ethical
                         behavior will foster the trust of investors, lead to robust global capital markets, and
                         ultimately benefit society. That is why ethics matters.

                         Ethics, Society, and the Capital Markets
                         CFA Institute includes the concept “for the ultimate benefit of society” as part of its
                         mission. The premise is that we want to live in a socially, politically, and financially
                         stable society that fosters individual well-being and welfare of the public. A key
                         ingredient for this goal is global capital markets that facilitate the efficient allocation
                         of resources so that the available capital finds its way to places where it most benefits
                         that society. These investments are then used to produce goods and services, to fund
                         innovation and jobs, and to promote improvements in standards of living. Indeed,
                         such a function serves the interests of the society. Efficient capital markets, in turn,
                         provide a host of benefits to those providing the investment capital. Investors are
                         provided the opportunity to transfer and transform risk because the capital markets
                         serve as an information exchange, create investment products, provide liquidity, and
                         limit transaction costs.
                             However, a well-functioning and efficient capital market system is dependent
                         on trust of the participants. If investors believe that capital market participants—
                         investment professionals and firms—cannot be trusted with their financial assets or
                         that the capital markets are unfair such that only insiders can be successful, they will
                         be unlikely to invest or, at the very least, will require a higher risk premium. Decreased
                         investment capital can reduce innovation and job creation and hurt the economy and
                         society as a whole. Reduced trust in capital markets can also result in a less vibrant,
                         if not smaller, investment industry.
                             Ethics for a global investment industry should be universal and ultimately support
                         trust and integrity above acceptable local or regional customs and culture. Universal
                         ethics for a global industry strongly supports the efficiency, values, and mission of
                         the industry as a whole. Different countries may be at different stages of development
                         in establishing standards of practice, but the end goal must be to achieve rules, reg-
                         ulations, and standards that support and promote fundamental ethical principles on
                         a global basis.

                         Capital Market Sustainability and the Actions of One
                         Individuals and firms also have to look at the indirect impacts of their actions on the
                         broader investment community. The increasingly interconnected nature of global
                         finance brings to the fore an added consideration of market sustainability that was,
                         perhaps, less appreciated in years past. In addition to committing to the highest lev-
                         els of ethical behavior, today’s investment professionals and their employers should
                         consider the long-term health of the market as a whole.
                             Apparently isolated and unrelated decisions, however innocuous when considered
                         on an individual basis, in aggregate can precipitate a market crisis. In an intercon-
                         nected global economy and marketplace, each participant should strive to be aware
                         of how his or her actions or the products he or she distributes may have an impact
                         on capital market participants in other regions or countries.
                             Investment professionals should consider how their investment decision-making
                         processes affect the global financial markets in the broader context of how they apply
                         their ethical and professional obligations. Those in positions of authority have a spe-
                         cial responsibility to consider the broader context of market sustainability in their
                         development and approval of corporate policies, particularly those involving risk

management and product development. In addition, corporate compensation strategies
should not encourage otherwise ethically sound individuals to engage in unethical or
questionable conduct for financial gain. Ethics, sustainability, and properly functioning
capital markets are components of the same concept of protecting the best interests
of all. To always place the interests of clients ahead of both investment professionals’
own interests and those of their employer remains a key ethos.

The Relationship between Ethics and Regulations
Some equate ethical behavior with legal behavior: If you are following the law, you
must be acting appropriately. Ethical principles, like laws and regulations, prescribe
appropriate constraints on our natural tendency to pursue self-interest that could harm
the interests of others. Laws and regulations often attempt to guide people toward
ethical behavior, but they do not cover all unethical behavior. Ethical behavior is often
distinguished from legal conduct by describing legal behavior as what is required and
ethical behavior as conduct that is morally correct. Ethical principles go beyond that
which is legally sufficient and encompass what is the right thing to do.
    Given many regulators’ lack of sufficient resources to enforce well-conceived rules
and regulations, relying on a regulatory framework to lead the charge in establishing
ethical behavior has its challenges. Therefore, reliance on compliance with laws and
regulation alone is insufficient to ensure ethical behavior of investment professionals
or to create a truly ethical culture in the industry.
    Inevitably, some individuals will succeed at circumventing the regulatory rules
for their personal gain. Only the application of strong ethical principles, at both the
individual level and the firm level, will limit abuses. Knowing the rules or regulations
to apply in a particular situation, although important, may not be sufficient to ensure
ethical conduct. Individuals must be able both to recognize areas that are prone to
ethical pitfalls and to identify and process those circumstances and influences that
can impair ethical judgment.

Applying an Ethical Framework
Laws, regulations, professional standards, and codes of ethics can guide ethical behav-
ior, but individual judgment is a critical ingredient in making principled choices and
engaging in appropriate conduct. When faced with an ethical dilemma, individuals
must have a well-developed set of principles; otherwise, their thought processes can
lead to, at best, equivocation and indecision and, at worst, fraudulent conduct and
destruction of the public trust. Establishing an ethical framework for an internal
thought process prior to deciding to act is a crucial step in engaging in ethical conduct.
     Most investment professionals are used to making decisions from a business
(profit/loss) outlook. But given the importance of ethical behavior in carrying out
professional responsibilities, it is critical to also analyze decisions and potential con-
duct from an ethical perspective. Utilizing a framework for ethical decision making
will help investment professionals effectively examine their conduct in the context
of conflicting interests common to their professional obligations (e.g., researching
and gathering information, developing investment recommendations, and managing
money for others). Such a framework will allow investment professionals to analyze
their conduct in a way that meets high standards of ethical behavior.
     An ethical decision-making framework can come in many forms but should provide
investment professionals with a tool for following the principles of the firm’s code of
ethics. Through analyzing the particular circumstances of each decision, investment
professionals are able to determine the best course of action to fulfill their responsi-
bilities in an ethical manner.

                         Commitment to Ethics by Firms
                         A firm’s code of ethics risks becoming a largely ignored, dusty compilation if it is
                         not truly integrated into the fabric of the business. The ability to relate an ethical
                         decision-making framework to a firm’s code of ethics allows investment professionals
                         to bring the aspirations and principles of the code of ethics to life—transforming it
                         from a compliance exercise to something that is at the heart of a firm’s culture.
                             An investment professional’s natural desire to “do the right thing” must be reinforced
                         by building a culture of integrity in the workplace. Development, maintenance, and
                         demonstration of a strong culture of integrity within the firm by senior management
                         may be the single most important factor in promoting ethical behavior among the
                         firm’s employees. Adopting a code of ethics that clearly lays out the ethical principles
                         that guide the thought processes and conduct the firm expects from its employees is
                         a critical first step. But a code of ethics, while necessary, is insufficient.
                             Simply nurturing an inclination to do right is no match for the multitude of daily
                         decisions that investment managers make. We need to exercise ethical decision-making
                         skills to develop the muscle memory necessary for fundamentally ethical people to make
                         good decisions despite the reality of conflicts of interest. Just as coaching and practice
                         transform our natural ability to run across a field into the technique and endurance
                         required to run a race, teaching, reinforcing, and practicing ethical decision-making
                         skills prepare us to confront the hard issues effectively. It is good for business, indi-
                         viduals, firms, the industry, and the markets, as well as society as a whole, to engage
                         in the investment management profession in a highly ethical manner.

                         Ethical Commitment of CFA Institute
                         An important goal of CFA Institute is to ensure that the organization and its mem-
                         bers and candidates develop, promote, and follow the highest ethical standards in
                         the investment industry. The CFA Institute Code of Ethics (Code) and Standards of
                         Professional Conduct (Standards) are the foundation supporting the organization’s quest
                         to uphold the industry’s highest standards of individual and corporate practice and to
                         help serve the greater good. The Code is a set of principles that define the overarching
                         conduct CFA Institute expects from its members and CFA Program candidates. The
                         Code works in tandem with the Standards, which outline professional conduct that
                         constitutes fair and ethical business practices.
                             For more than 60 years, CFA Institute members and candidates have been required
                         to abide by the organization’s Code and Standards. Periodically, CFA Institute has
                         revised and updated its Code and Standards to ensure that they remain relevant to
                         the changing nature of the investment profession and representative of the highest
                         standard of professional conduct. Within the Standards of PracticeHandbook, CFA
                         Institute addresses ethical principles for the profession, including individual profes-
                         sionalism; responsibilities to capital markets, clients, and employers; ethics involved in
                         investment analysis, recommendations, and actions; and possible conflicts of interest.
                         Although the investment world has become a far more complex place since the first
                         publication of the Standards of Practice Handbook, distinguishing right from wrong
                         remains the paramount principle of the Code and Standards.
                             New challenges will continually arise for members and candidates in applying the
                         Code and Standards because many decisions are not unambiguously right or wrong.
                         The dilemma exists because the choice between right and wrong is not always clear.
                         Even well-intentioned investment professionals can find themselves in circumstances
                         that may tempt them to cut corners. Situational influences can overpower the best
                         of intentions.
                             CFA Institute has made a significant commitment to providing members and
                         candidates with the resources to extend and deepen their understanding of how to
                         appropriately apply the principles of the Code and Standards. The product offerings

    Markets function to an important extent on trust. Investment professionals
should remain mindful of the long-term health of financial markets and incorporate
this concern for the market’s sustainability in their investment decision making. CFA

Preamble
The CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct are funda-
mental to the values of CFA Institute and essential to achieving its mission to con-
tinue to lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards
of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society.
High ethical standards are critical to maintaining the public’s trust in financial mar-
kets and in the investment profession. Since their creation in the 1960s, the Code
and Standards have promoted the integrity of CFA Institute members and served
as a model for measuring the ethics of investment professionals globally, regardless
of job function, cultural differences, or local laws and regulations. All CFA Institute
members (including holders of the Chartered Financial Analyst [CFA] designation)
and CFA candidates have the personal responsibility to embrace and uphold the
provisions of the Code and Standards and are encouraged to notify their employer
of this responsibility. Violations may result in disciplinary sanctions by CFA Institute.
Sanctions can include revocation of membership, revocation of candidacy in the CFA
Program, and revocation of the right to use the CFA designation.

50   Learning Module 2                                     Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct




                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. C is correct. When an inquiry is initiated, the Professional Conduct staff con-
                            ducts an investigation that may include requesting a written explanation from the
                            member or candidate.
                            A is incorrect because Professional Conduct inquiries can be initiated in re-
                            sponse to information provided by the media. CFA Institute staff may become
                            aware of questionable conduct by a member or candidate through the media, reg-
                            ulatory notices, or other public sources.
                            B is incorrect because although the Disciplinary Review Committee (DRC) is
                            responsible for enforcement of the Code and Standards in conjunction with the
                            Professional Conduct Program (PCP), only in the event that a member or candi-
                            date does not accept the charges and proposed sanction is the matter referred to
                            a panel composed of DRC members.

                         2. C is correct. One of the principles in the Code of Ethics reflects the role that the
                            capital markets have in society as a whole.
                            A is incorrect because it is incomplete, missing the additional language to reflect
                            the role that the capital markets have in society as a whole.
                            B is incorrect because the principle as written in the Code of Ethics reflects the
                            role of the capital markets in society as a whole.

                         3. C is correct. Given the constant development of new and exotic financial in-
                            struments and strategies, the standard regarding communicating with clients
                            includes an implicit requirement to disclose to clients the risks and limitations of
                            recommendations being made to clients.
                            A is incorrect because the standard for members and candidates with supervision
                            or authority over others within their firms stresses broader compliance expecta-
                            tions beyond the detection and prevention aspects of violations.
                            B is incorrect because the standards have evolved over time to remain represen-
                            tative of the highest standards of professional conduct and relevant to the chang-
                            ing nature of the investment profession.

                         4. B is correct. The Standards of Professional Conduct require members and can-
                            didates to promptly disclose any changes that might materially affect investment
                            processes.
                            A is incorrect because under Standard III(C) Suitability, when members and can-
                            didates are responsible for managing a portfolio according to a specific mandate,
                            they must take only investment actions that are consistent with the stated objec-
                            tives of the portfolio and not be concerned with whether the mandate is suitable
                            for all investors.
                            C is incorrect because under Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality,
                            members and candidates must keep information about current clients confiden-
                            tial unless the information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client,
                            disclosure is required by law, or the client permits disclosure. No decisions on
                            confidentiality are required, with the “reasonable and adequate basis” criterion
                            related to Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis.

                         5. B is correct. Under Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information, members
                            who possess material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an
                            investment must not cause others to act on the information.
                            A is incorrect because price distortion is mentioned in Standard II(B) Market
                            Manipulation, not Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information.

Solutions                                                                                51


   C is incorrect because the maintenance of appropriate records to support invest-
   ment analyses is noted in Standard V(C) Record Retention, not Standard II(A)
   Material Nonpublic Information.

6. B is correct. Standard III(C) Suitability states that when members and candidates
   are in an advisory relationship with a client, they must judge the suitability of
   investments in the context of the client’s total portfolio.
   A is incorrect because this requirement is addressed under Standard III(A) Loyal-
   ty, Prudence, and Care, not Standard III(C) Suitability.
   C is incorrect because this requirement is addressed under Standard I(C) Misrep-
   resentation, not Standard III(C) Suitability.

7. C is correct. Under Standard III(B) Fair Dealing, members and candidates must
   deal fairly and objectively with all clients when providing investment analysis,
   making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in
   other professional activities.
   A is incorrect because under Standard III(C) Suitability, members and candidates
   in an advisory relationship must make a reasonable inquiry into a client’s finan-
   cial constraints prior to (not after) taking investment action and must reassess
   and update this regularly.
   B is incorrect because under Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care,
   members and candidates must act for the benefit of their clients and place their
   clients’ interests before (not maintain an equal balance with) their employer’s or
   their own interests.

8. B is correct. Standard IV(A) Loyalty states that members and candidates cannot
   deprive their employer of the advantage of their skills and abilities in matters
   related to their employment.
   A is incorrect because accepting gifts that might compromise a member’s or can-
   didate’s independence and objectivity is addressed by Standard I: Professionalism,
   not Standard IV: Duties to Employers.
   C is incorrect because Standard IV(B) Additional Compensation Arrangements
   permits members and candidates to accept compensation that competes with
   their employer’s interest if they obtain written consent from all parties involved.

9. C is correct. Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients
   states that members and candidates must distinguish between fact and opinion in
   the presentation of investment analysis and recommendations.
   A is incorrect because this standard is discussed in Standard III: Duties to
   Clients.
   B is incorrect because performance presentation is discussed in Standard III:
   Duties to Clients.

10. C is correct. Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation,
    and the CFA Program explicitly states the appropriate manner to make reference
    to CFA Institute, CFA Institute membership, the CFA designation, or candidacy
    in the CFA Program.
    A is incorrect because Standard VII: Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member
    or CFA Candidate does not refer to loyalty. Loyalty is addressed in two other
    standards, Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care and as part of Standard
    IV: Duties to Employers.
    B is incorrect because Standard VII does not refer to the responsibility of super-
    visors. The responsibility of supervisors is addressed in Standard IV(C) Responsi-
    bility of Supervisors.

54   Learning Module 3                                                           Guidance for Standards I–VII


                         Members and candidates must understand the applicable laws and regulations of
                         the countries and jurisdictions where they engage in professional activities. These
                         activities may include, but are not limited to, trading of securities or other financial
                         instruments, providing investment advice, conducting research, or performing other
                         investment services. On the basis of their reasonable and good faith understanding,
                         members and candidates must comply with the laws and regulations that directly
                         govern their professional activities and resulting outcomes and that protect the
                         interests of the clients.
                             When questions arise, members and candidates should know their firm’s policies
                         and procedures for accessing compliance guidance. This standard does not require
                         members and candidates to become experts, however, in compliance. Additionally,
                         members and candidates are not required to have detailed knowledge of or be experts
                         on all the laws that could potentially govern their activities.
                             During times of changing regulations, members and candidates must remain vigilant
                         in maintaining their knowledge of the requirements for their professional activities.
                         New financial products and processes, along with uncovered ethical missteps, create an
                         environment for recurring and potentially wide-ranging regulatory changes. Members
                         and candidates are also continually provided improved and enhanced methods of
                         communicating with both clients and potential clients, such as mobile applications
                         and web-based social networking platforms. As new local, regional, and global
                         requirements are updated to address these and other changes, members, candidates,
                         and their firms must adjust their procedures and practices to remain in compliance.

                         Relationship between the Code and Standards and Applicable Law
                         Some members or candidates may live, work, or provide investment services to clients
                         living in a country that has no law or regulation governing a particular action or that
                         has laws or regulations that differ from the requirements of the Code and Standards.
                         When applicable law and the Code and Standards require different conduct, mem-
                         bers and candidates must follow the more strict of the applicable law or the Code
                         and Standards.
                             “Applicable law” is the law that governs the member’s or candidate’s conduct.
                         Which law applies will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each
                         case. The “more strict” law or regulation is the law or regulation that imposes greater
                         restrictions on the action of the member or candidate or calls for the member or
                         candidate to exert a greater degree of action that protects the interests of investors.
                         For example, applicable law or regulation may not require members and candidates
                         to disclose referral fees received from or paid to others for the recommendation of
                         investment products or services. Because the Code and Standards impose this obli-
                         gation, however, members and candidates must disclose the existence of such fees.
                             Members and candidates must adhere to the following principles:
                             ■   Members and candidates must comply with applicable laws or regulations
                                 related to their professional activities.
                             ■   Members and candidates must not engage in conduct that constitutes a vio-
                                 lation of the Code and Standards, even though it may otherwise be legal.
                             ■   In the absence of any applicable law or regulation or when the Code and
                                 Standards impose a higher degree of responsibility than applicable laws
                                 and regulations, members and candidates must adhere to the Code and
                                 Standards. Applications of these principles are outlined in Exhibit 1.
                            The applicable laws governing the responsibilities of a member or candidate should
                         be viewed as the minimal threshold of acceptable actions. When members and can-
                         didates take actions that exceed the minimal requirements, they further support the
                         conduct required of Standard I(A).

Standard I: Professionalism                                                                    55


    CFA Institute members are obligated to abide by the CFA Institute Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws, Code of Ethics, Standards of Professional Conduct, Rules of
Procedure, Membership Agreement, and other applicable rules promulgated by CFA
Institute, all as amended periodically. CFA candidates who are not members must
also abide by these documents (except for the Membership Agreement) as well as
rules and regulations related to the administration of the CFA® exam, the Candidate
Responsibility Statement, and the Candidate Pledge.

Participation in or Association with Violations by Others
Members and candidates are responsible for violations in which they knowingly par-
ticipate or assist. Although members and candidates are presumed to have knowledge
of all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, CFA Institute acknowledges that mem-
bers may not recognize violations if they are not aware of all the facts giving rise to
the violations. Standard I(A) applies when members and candidates know or should
know that their conduct may contribute to a violation of applicable laws, rules, or
regulations or the Code and Standards.
     If a member or candidate has reasonable grounds to believe that imminent or
ongoing client or employer activities are illegal or unethical, the member or candi-
date must dissociate, or separate, from the activity. In extreme cases, dissociation
may require a member or candidate to leave his or her employment. Members and
candidates may take the following intermediate steps to dissociate from ethical vio-
lations of others when direct discussions with the person or persons committing the
violation are unsuccessful. The first step should be to attempt to stop the behavior by
bringing it to the attention of the employer through a supervisor or the firm’s compli-
ance department. If this attempt is unsuccessful, then members and candidates have
a responsibility to step away and dissociate from the activity. Dissociation practices
will differ on the basis of the member’s or candidate’s role in the investment industry.
It may include removing one’s name from written reports or recommendations, asking
for a different assignment, or refusing to accept a new client or continue to advise a
current client. Inaction combined with continuing association with those involved
in illegal or unethical conduct may be construed as participation or assistance in the
illegal or unethical conduct.
     CFA Institute strongly encourages members and candidates to report potential
violations of the Code and Standards committed by fellow members and candidates.
Although a failure to report is less likely to be construed as a violation than a failure to
dissociate from unethical conduct, the impact of inactivity on the integrity of capital
markets can be significant. Although the Code and Standards do not compel members
and candidates to report violations to their governmental or regulatory organizations
unless such disclosure is mandatory under applicable law (voluntary reporting is
often referred to as whistleblowing), such disclosure may be prudent under certain
circumstances. Members and candidates should consult their legal and compliance
advisers for guidance.
     Additionally, CFA Institute encourages members, nonmembers, clients, and the
investing public to report violations of the Code and Standards by CFA Institute
members or CFA candidates by submitting a complaint in writing to the CFA Institute
Professional Conduct Program via e-mail (pcprogram@​cfainstitute​.org) or the CFA
Institute website (www​.cfainstitute​.org).

Investment Products and Applicable Laws
Members and candidates involved in creating or maintaining investment services or
investment products or packages of securities and/or derivatives should be mindful
of where these products or packages will be sold as well as their places of origina-
tion. The applicable laws and regulations of the countries or regions of origination
and expected sale should be understood by those responsible for the supervision of

                         the services or creation and maintenance of the products or packages. Members or
                         candidates should make reasonable efforts to review whether associated firms that
                         are distributing products or services developed by their employing firm also abide by
                         the laws and regulations of the countries and regions of distribution. Members and
                         candidates should undertake the necessary due diligence when transacting cross-border
                         business to understand the multiple applicable laws and regulations in order to protect
                         the reputation of their firm and themselves.
                             Given the complexity that can arise with business transactions in today’s market,
                         there may be some uncertainty surrounding which laws or regulations are considered
                         applicable when activities are being conducted in multiple jurisdictions. Members
                         and candidates should seek the appropriate guidance, potentially including the firm’s
                         compliance or legal departments and legal counsel outside the organization, to gain
                         a reasonable understanding of their responsibilities and how to implement them
                         appropriately.

                          Exhibit 1: Global Application of the Code and Standards

                            Members and candidates who practice in multiple jurisdictions may be subject
                            to varied securities laws and regulations. If applicable law is stricter than the
                            requirements of the Code and Standards, members and candidates must adhere
                            to applicable law; otherwise, they must adhere to the Code and Standards. The
                            following chart provides illustrations involving a member who may be subject

             2           STANDARD I(A): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES


                         Members and Candidates
                         Suggested methods by which members and candidates can acquire and maintain
                         understanding of applicable laws, rules, and regulations include the following:
                             ■   Stay informed: Members and candidates should establish or encourage
                                 their employers to establish a procedure by which employees are regularly
                                 informed about changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, and case law.
                                 In many instances, the employer’s compliance department or legal counsel
                                 can provide such information in the form of memorandums distributed to
                                 employees in the organization. Also, participation in an internal or external
                                 continuing education program is a practical method of staying current.
                             ■   Review procedures: Members and candidates should review, or encourage
                                 their employers to review, the firm’s written compliance procedures on a
                                 regular basis to ensure that the procedures reflect current law and provide
                                 adequate guidance to employees about what is permissible conduct under
                                 the law and/or the Code and Standards. Recommended compliance pro-
                                 cedures for specific items of the Code and Standards are discussed in this
                                 Handbook in the “Guidance” sections associated with each standard.
                             ■   Maintain current files: Members and candidates should maintain or encour-
                                 age their employers to maintain readily accessible current reference copies
                                 of applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and important cases.



                         Distribution Area Laws
                         Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to understand the applicable
                         laws—both country and regional—for the countries and regions where their investment
                         products are developed and are most likely to be distributed to clients.


                         Legal Counsel
                         When in doubt about the appropriate action to undertake, it is recommended that
                         a member or candidate seek the advice of compliance personnel or legal counsel
                         concerning legal requirements. If a potential violation is being committed by a fellow
                         employee, it may also be prudent for the member or candidate to seek the advice of
                         the firm’s compliance department or legal counsel.


                         Dissociation
                         When dissociating from an activity that violates the Code and Standards, members
                         and candidates should document the violation and urge their firms to attempt to
                         persuade the perpetrator(s) to cease such conduct. To dissociate from the conduct, a
                         member or candidate may have to resign his or her employment.

Standard I(A): Application of the Standard                                                      59



Firms
The formality and complexity of compliance procedures for firms depend on the nature
and size of the organization and the nature of its investment operations. Members
and candidates should encourage their firms to consider the following policies and
procedures to support the principles of Standard I(A):
   ■   Develop and/or adopt a code of ethics: The ethical culture of an organization
       starts at the top. Members and candidates should encourage their super-
       visors or managers to adopt a code of ethics. Adhering to a code of ethics
       facilitates solutions when people face ethical dilemmas and can prevent the
       need for employees to resort to a “whistleblowing” solution publicly alleging
       concealed misconduct. CFA Institute has published the Asset Manager Code
       of Professional Conduct, which firms may adopt or use as the basis for their
       codes (visit www​.cfainstitute​.org).
   ■   Provide information on applicable laws: Pertinent information that high-
       lights applicable laws and regulations might be distributed to employees
       or made available in a central location. Information sources might include
       primary information developed by the relevant government, governmen-
       tal agencies, regulatory organizations, licensing agencies, and professional
       associations (e.g., from their websites); law firm memorandums or news-
       letters; and association memorandums or publications (e.g., CFA Institute
       Magazine).
   ■   Establish procedures for reporting violations: Firms might provide written
       protocols for reporting suspected violations of laws, regulations, or com-
       pany policies.




STANDARD I(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                            3
Example 1 (Notification of Known Violations):
Michael Allen works for a brokerage firm and is responsible for an underwriting of
securities. A company official gives Allen information indicating that the financial
statements Allen filed with the regulator overstate the issuer’s earnings. Allen seeks
the advice of the brokerage firm’s general counsel, who states that it would be difficult
for the regulator to prove that Allen has been involved in any wrongdoing.
       Comment: Although it is recommended that members and candidates seek
       the advice of legal counsel, the reliance on such advice does not absolve
       a member or candidate from the requirement to comply with the law or
       regulation. Allen should report this situation to his supervisor, seek an
       independent legal opinion, and determine whether the regulator should
       be notified of the error.



Example 2 (Dissociating from a Violation):
Lawrence Brown’s employer, an investment banking firm, is the principal underwriter
for an issue of convertible debentures by the Courtney Company. Brown discovers
that the Courtney Company has concealed severe third-quarter losses in its foreign
operations. The preliminary prospectus has already been distributed.

                                Comment: Knowing that the preliminary prospectus is misleading, Brown
                                should report his findings to the appropriate supervisory persons in his
                                firm. If the matter is not remedied and Brown’s employer does not dissociate
                                from the underwriting, Brown should sever all his connections with the
                                underwriting. Brown should also seek legal advice to determine whether
                                additional reporting or other action should be taken.



                         Example 3 (Dissociating from a Violation):
                         Kamisha Washington’s firm advertises its past performance record by showing the
                         10-year return of a composite of its client accounts. Washington discovers, however,
                         that the composite omits the performance of accounts that have left the firm during
                         the 10-year period, whereas the description of the composite indicates the inclusion of
                         all firm accounts. This omission has led to an inflated performance figure. Washington
                         is asked to use promotional material that includes the erroneous performance number
                         when soliciting business for the firm.
                                Comment: Misrepresenting performance is a violation of the Code and
                                Standards. Although she did not calculate the performance herself,
                                Washington would be assisting in violating Standard I(A) if she were to
                                use the inflated performance number when soliciting clients. She must
                                dissociate herself from the activity. If discussing the misleading number
                                with the person responsible is not an option for correcting the problem, she
                                can bring the situation to the attention of her supervisor or the compliance
                                department at her firm. If her firm is unwilling to recalculate performance,
                                she must refrain from using the misleading promotional material and should
                                notify the firm of her reasons. If the firm insists that she use the material,
                                she should consider whether her obligation to dissociate from the activity
                                requires her to seek other employment.



                         Example 4 (Following the Highest Requirements):
                         James Collins is an investment analyst for a major Wall Street brokerage firm. He
                         works in a developing country with a rapidly modernizing economy and a growing
                         capital market. Local securities laws are minimal—in form and content—and include
                         no punitive prohibitions against insider trading.
                                Comment: Collins must abide by the requirements of the Code and

                         Example 5 (Following the Highest Requirements):
                         Laura Jameson works for a multinational investment adviser based in the United
                         States. Jameson lives and works as a registered investment adviser in the tiny, but
                         wealthy, island nation of Karramba. Karramba’s securities laws state that no invest-
                         ment adviser registered and working in that country can participate in initial public
                         offerings (IPOs) for the adviser’s personal account. Jameson, believing that, as a US

citizen working for a US-based company, she should comply only with US law, has
ignored this Karrambian law. In addition, Jameson believes that as a charterholder,
as long as she adheres to the Code and Standards requirement that she disclose her
participation in any IPO to her employer and clients when such ownership creates a
conflict of interest, she is meeting the highest ethical requirements.
       Comment: Jameson is in violation of Standard I(A). As a registered invest-
       ment adviser in Karramba, Jameson is prevented by Karrambian securities
       law from participating in IPOs regardless of the law of her home country.
       In addition, because the law of the country where she is working is stricter
       than the Code and Standards, she must follow the stricter requirements
       of the local law rather than the requirements of the Code and Standards.



Example 6 (Laws and Regulations Based on Religious Tenets):
Amanda Janney is employed as a fixed-income portfolio manager for a large interna-
tional firm. She is on a team within her firm that is responsible for creating and man-
aging a fixed-income hedge fund to be sold throughout the firm’s distribution centers
to high-net-worth clients. Her firm receives expressions of interest from potential
clients from the Middle East who are seeking investments that comply with Islamic
law. The marketing and promotional materials for the fixed-income hedge fund do
not specify whether or not the fund is a suitable investment for an investor seeking
compliance with Islamic law. Because the fund is being distributed globally, Janney
is concerned about the reputation of the fund and the firm and believes disclosure
of whether or not the fund complies with Islamic law could help minimize potential
mistakes with placing this investment.
       Comment: As the financial market continues to become globalized, members
       and candidates will need to be aware of the differences between cultural
       and religious laws and requirements as well as the different governmental
       laws and regulations. Janney and the firm could be proactive in their efforts
       to acknowledge areas where the new fund may not be suitable for clients.



Example 7 (Reporting Potential Unethical Actions):
Krista Blume is a junior portfolio manager for high-net-worth portfolios at a large
global investment manager. She observes a number of new portfolios and relationships
coming from a country in Europe where the firm did not have previous business and
is told that a broker in that country is responsible for this new business. At a meeting
on allocation of research resources to third-party research firms, Blume notes that this
broker has been added to the list and is allocated payments for research. However, she
knows the portfolios do not invest in securities in the broker’s country, and she has
not seen any research come from this broker. Blume asks her supervisor about the
name being on the list and is told that someone in marketing is receiving the research
and that the name being on the list is OK. She believes that what may be going on
is that the broker is being paid for new business through the inappropriate research
payments, and she wishes to dissociate from the misconduct.
       Comment: Blume should follow the firm’s policies and procedures for
       reporting potential unethical activity, which may include discussions with
       her supervisor or someone in a designated compliance department. She
       should communicate her concerns appropriately while advocating for dis-
       closure between the new broker relationship and the research payments.

                         Example 8 (Failure to Maintain Knowledge of the Law):
                         Colleen White is excited to use new technology to communicate with clients and
                         potential clients. She recently began posting investment information, including per-
                         formance reports and investment opinions and recommendations, to her Facebook
                         page. In addition, she sends out brief announcements, opinions, and thoughts via her
                         X account (for example, “Prospects for future growth of XYZ company look good!
                         #makingmoney4U”). Prior to White’s use of these social media platforms, the local
                         regulator had issued new requirements and guidance governing online electronic
                         communication. White’s communications appear to conflict with the recent regula-
                         tory announcements.
                                 Comment: White is in violation of Standard I(A) because her communica-
                                 tions do not comply with the existing guidance and regulation governing
                                 use of social media. White must be aware of the evolving legal requirements
                                 pertaining to new and dynamic areas of the financial services industry that
                                 are applicable to her. She should seek guidance from appropriate, knowl-
                                 edgeable, and reliable sources, such as her firm’s compliance department,
                                 external service providers, or outside counsel, unless she diligently follows
                                 legal and regulatory trends affecting her professional responsibilities.

Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity                                                   63


    ■   Influence during the Manager Selection/Procurement Process
    ■   Issuer-Paid Research
    ■   Travel Funding
Standard I(B) states the responsibility of CFA Institute members and candidates in
the CFA Program to maintain independence and objectivity so that their clients will
have the benefit of their work and opinions unaffected by any potential conflict of
interest or other circumstance adversely affecting their judgment. Every member and
candidate should endeavor to avoid situations that could cause or be perceived to
cause a loss of independence or objectivity in recommending investments or taking
investment action.
     External sources may try to influence the investment process by offering analysts
and portfolio managers a variety of benefits. Corporations may seek expanded research
coverage, issuers and underwriters may wish to promote new securities offerings,
brokers may want to increase commission business, and independent rating agencies
may be influenced by the company requesting the rating. Benefits may include gifts,
invitations to lavish functions, tickets, favors, or job referrals. One type of benefit
is the allocation of shares in oversubscribed IPOs to investment managers for their
personal accounts. This practice affords managers the opportunity to make quick
profits that may not be available to their clients. Such a practice is prohibited under
Standard I(B). Modest gifts and entertainment are acceptable, but special care must
be taken by members and candidates to resist subtle and not-so-subtle pressures to
act in conflict with the interests of their clients. Best practice dictates that members
and candidates reject any offer of gift or entertainment that could be expected to
threaten their independence and objectivity.
     Receiving a gift, benefit, or consideration from a client can be distinguished from
gifts given by entities seeking to influence a member or candidate to the detriment
of other clients. In a client relationship, the client has already entered some type of
compensation arrangement with the member, candidate, or his or her firm. A gift
from a client could be considered supplementary compensation. The potential for
obtaining influence to the detriment of other clients, although present, is not as great
as in situations where no compensation arrangement exists. When possible, prior to
accepting “bonuses” or gifts from clients, members and candidates should disclose to
their employers such benefits offered by clients. If notification is not possible prior to
acceptance, members and candidates must disclose to their employer benefits previ-
ously accepted from clients. Disclosure allows the employer of a member or candidate
to make an independent determination about the extent to which the gift may affect
the member’s or candidate’s independence and objectivity.
     Members and candidates may also come under pressure from their own firms to, for
example, issue favorable research reports or recommendations for certain companies
with potential or continuing business relationships with the firm. The situation may be
aggravated if an executive of the company sits on the bank or investment firm’s board
and attempts to interfere in investment decision making. Members and candidates
acting in a sales or marketing capacity must be especially mindful of their objectivity
in promoting appropriate investments for their clients.
     Left unmanaged, pressures that threaten independence place research analysts in a
difficult position and may jeopardize their ability to act independently and objectively.
One of the ways that research analysts have coped with these pressures in the past
is to use subtle and ambiguous language in their recommendations or to temper the
tone of their research reports. Such subtleties are lost on some investors, however,
who reasonably expect research reports and recommendations to be straightforward
and transparent and to communicate clearly an analyst’s views based on unbiased
analysis and independent judgment.

                             Members and candidates are personally responsible for maintaining independence
                         and objectivity when preparing research reports, making investment recommendations,
                         and taking investment action on behalf of clients. Recommendations must convey the
                         member’s or candidate’s true opinions, free of bias from internal or external pressures,
                         and be stated in clear and unambiguous language.
                             Members and candidates also should be aware that some of their professional or
                         social activities within CFA Institute or its member societies may subtly threaten their
                         independence or objectivity. When seeking corporate financial support for conventions,
                         seminars, or even weekly society luncheons, the members or candidates responsible
                         for the activities should evaluate both the actual effect of such solicitations on their
                         independence and whether their objectivity might be perceived to be compromised
                         in the eyes of their clients.

                         Buy-Side Clients
                         One source of pressure on sell-side analysts is buy-side clients. Institutional clients
                         are traditionally the primary users of sell-side research, either directly or with soft
                         dollar brokerage. Portfolio managers may have significant positions in the security
                         of a company under review. A rating downgrade may adversely affect the portfolio’s
                         performance, particularly in the short term, because the sensitivity of stock prices
                         to ratings changes has increased in recent years. A downgrade may also affect the
                         manager’s compensation, which is usually tied to portfolio performance. Moreover,
                         portfolio performance is subject to media and public scrutiny, which may affect the
                         manager’s professional reputation. Consequently, some portfolio managers implicitly
                         or explicitly support sell-side ratings inflation.
                             Portfolio managers have a responsibility to respect and foster the intellectual hon-
                         esty of sell-side research. Therefore, it is improper for portfolio managers to threaten
                         or engage in retaliatory practices, such as reporting sell-side analysts to the covered
                         company in order to instigate negative corporate reactions. Although most portfolio
                         managers do not engage in such practices, the perception by the research analyst
                         that a reprisal is possible may cause concern and make it difficult for the analyst to
                         maintain independence and objectivity.

                         Fund Manager and Custodial Relationships
                         Research analysts are not the only people who must be concerned with maintaining
                         their independence. Members and candidates who are responsible for hiring and
                         retaining outside managers and third-party custodians should not accepts gifts,
                         entertainment, or travel funding that may be perceived as impairing their decisions.
                         The use of secondary fund managers has evolved into a common practice to manage
                         specific asset allocations. The use of third-party custodians is common practice for
                         independent investment advisory firms and helps them with trading capabilities and
                         reporting requirements. Primary and secondary fund managers, as well as third-party
                         custodians, often arrange educational and marketing events to inform others about
                         their business strategies, investment process, or custodial services. Members and
                         candidates must review the merits of each offer individually in determining whether
                         they may attend yet maintain their independence.

                         Investment Banking Relationships
                         Some sell-side firms may exert pressure on their analysts to issue favorable research
                         reports on current or prospective investment banking clients. For many of these firms,
                         income from investment banking has become increasingly important to overall firm
                         profitability because brokerage income has declined as a result of price competition.
                         Consequently, firms offering investment banking services work hard to develop and
                         maintain relationships with investment banking clients and prospects. These companies

are often covered by the firm’s research analysts because companies often select their
investment banks on the basis of the reputation of their research analysts, the quality
of their work, and their standing in the industry.
     In some countries, research analysts frequently work closely with their investment
banking colleagues to help evaluate prospective investment banking clients. In other
countries, because of past abuses in managing the obvious conflicts of interest, regula-
tors have established clear rules prohibiting the interaction of these groups. Although
collaboration between research analysts and investment banking colleagues may
benefit the firm and enhance market efficiency (e.g., by allowing firms to assess risks
more accurately and make better pricing assumptions), it requires firms to carefully
balance the conflicts of interest inherent in the collaboration. Having analysts work
with investment bankers is appropriate only when the conflicts are adequately and
effectively managed and disclosed. Firm managers have a responsibility to provide an
environment in which analysts are neither coerced nor enticed into issuing research
that does not reflect their true opinions. Firms should require public disclosure of
actual conflicts of interest to investors.
     Members, candidates, and their firms must adopt and follow perceived best
practices in maintaining independence and objectivity in the corporate culture and
protecting analysts from undue pressure by their investment banking colleagues. The
“firewalls” traditionally built between these two functions must be managed to minimize
conflicts of interest; indeed, enhanced firewall policies may go as far as prohibiting
all communications between these groups. A key element of an enhanced firewall
is separate reporting structures for personnel on the research side and personnel
on the investment banking side. For example, investment banking personnel should
not have any authority to approve, disapprove, or make changes to research reports
or recommendations. Another element should be a compensation arrangement that
minimizes the pressures on research analysts and rewards objectivity and accuracy.
Compensation arrangements should not link analyst remuneration directly to invest-
ment banking assignments in which the analyst may participate as a team member.
Firms should also regularly review their policies and procedures to determine whether
analysts are adequately safeguarded and to improve the transparency of disclosures
relating to conflicts of interest. The highest level of transparency is achieved when
disclosures are prominent and specific rather than marginalized and generic.

Performance Measurement and Attribution
Members and candidates working within a firm’s investment performance measurement
department may also be presented with situations that challenge their independence
and objectivity. As performance analysts, their analyses may reveal instances where
managers may appear to have strayed from their mandate. Additionally, the perfor-
mance analyst may receive requests to alter the construction of composite indexes
owing to negative results for a selected account or fund. The member or candidate
must not allow internal or external influences to affect their independence and objec-
tivity as they faithfully complete their performance calculation and analysis-related
responsibilities.

Public Companies
Analysts may be pressured to issue favorable reports and recommendations by the
companies they follow. Not every stock is a “buy,” and not every research report is
favorable—for many reasons, including the cyclical nature of many business activities
and market fluctuations. For instance, a “good company” does not always translate into
a “good stock” rating if the current stock price is fully valued. In making an invest-
ment recommendation, the analyst is responsible for anticipating, interpreting, and
assessing a company’s prospects and stock price performance in a factual manner.
Many company managers, however, believe that their company’s stock is undervalued,

                         and these managers may find it difficult to accept critical research reports or ratings
                         downgrades. Company managers’ compensation may also be dependent on stock
                         performance.
                             Due diligence in financial research and analysis involves gathering information
                         from a wide variety of sources, including public disclosure documents (such as proxy
                         statements, annual reports, and other regulatory filings) and also company manage-
                         ment and investor-relations personnel, suppliers, customers, competitors, and other
                         relevant sources. Research analysts may justifiably fear that companies will limit
                         their ability to conduct thorough research by denying analysts who have “negative”
                         views direct access to company managers and/or barring them from conference calls
                         and other communication venues. Retaliatory practices include companies bringing
                         legal action against analysts personally and/or their firms to seek monetary damages
                         for the economic effects of negative reports and recommendations. Although few
                         companies engage in such behavior, the perception that a reprisal is possible is a rea-
                         sonable concern for analysts. This concern may make it difficult for them to conduct

                         information and guidance, members and candidates should refer to the CFA Institute

                         Credit Rating Agency Opinions
                         Credit rating agencies provide a service by grading the fixed-income products offered
                         by companies. Analysts face challenges related to incentives and compensation
                         schemes that may be tied to the final rating and successful placement of the product.
                         Members and candidates employed at rating agencies should ensure that procedures
                         and processes at the agencies prevent undue influences from a sponsoring company
                         during the analysis. Members and candidates should abide by their agencies’ and the
                         industry’s standards of conduct regarding the analytical process and the distribution
                         of their reports.
                             The work of credit rating agencies also raises concerns similar to those inherent
                         in investment banking relationships. Analysts may face pressure to issue ratings at a
                         specific level because of other services the agency offers companies—namely, advis-
                         ing on the development of structured products. The rating agencies need to develop
                         the necessary firewalls and protections to allow the independent operations of their
                         different business lines.
                             When using information provided by credit rating agencies, members and can-
                         didates should be mindful of the potential conflicts of interest. And because of the
                         potential conflicts, members and candidates may need to independently validate the
                         rating granted.

                         Influence during the Manager Selection/Procurement Process
                         Members and candidates may find themselves on either side of the manager selection
                         process. An individual may be on the hiring side as a representative of a pension
                         organization or an investment committee member of an endowment or a charitable
                         organization. Additionally, other members may be representing their organizations in
                         attempts to earn new investment allocation mandates. The responsibility of members
                         and candidates to maintain their independence and objectivity extends to the hiring
                         or firing of those who provide business services beyond investment management.
                             When serving in a hiring capacity, members and candidates should not solicit
                         gifts, contributions, or other compensation that may affect their independence and
                         objectivity. Solicitations do not have to benefit members and candidates personally to
                         conflict with Standard I(B). Requesting contributions to a favorite charity or political
                         organization may also be perceived as an attempt to influence the decision-making

process. Additionally, members and candidates serving in a hiring capacity should
refuse gifts, donations, and other offered compensation that may be perceived to
influence their decision-making process.
    When working to earn a new investment allocation, members and candidates
should not offer gifts, contributions, or other compensation to influence the decision
of the hiring representative. The offering of these items with the intent to impair the
independence and objectivity of another person would not comply with Standard I(B).
Such prohibited actions may include offering donations to a charitable organization
or political candidate referred by the hiring representative.
    A clear example of improperly influencing hiring representatives was displayed
in the “pay-to-play” scandal involving government-sponsored pension funds in the
United States. Managers looking to gain lucrative allocations from the large funds
made requested donations to the political campaigns of individuals directly respon-
sible for the hiring decisions. This scandal and other similar events have led to new
laws requiring additional reporting concerning political contributions and bans on
hiring—or hiring delays for—managers that made campaign contributions to repre-
sentatives associated with the decision-making process.

Issuer-Paid Research
In light of the recent reduction of sell-side research coverage, many companies, seeking
to increase visibility both in the financial markets and with potential investors, have
hired analysts to produce research reports analyzing their companies. These reports
bridge the gap created by the lack of coverage and can be an effective method of
communicating with investors.
     Issuer-paid research conducted by independent analysts, however, is fraught with
potential conflicts. Depending on how the research is written and distributed, investors
may be misled into believing that the research is from an independent source when,
in reality, it has been paid for by the subject company.
     Members and candidates must adhere to strict standards of conduct that govern
how the research is to be conducted and what disclosures must be made in the report.
Analysts must engage in thorough, independent, and unbiased analysis and must fully
disclose potential conflicts of interest, including the nature of their compensation.
Otherwise, analysts risk misleading investors.
     Investors need clear, credible, and thorough information about companies, and
they need research based on independent thought. At a minimum, issuer-paid research
should include a thorough analysis of the company’s financial statements based on
publicly disclosed information, benchmarking within a peer group, and industry anal-
ysis. Analysts must exercise diligence, independence, and thoroughness in conducting
their research in an objective manner. Analysts must distinguish between fact and
opinion in their reports. Conclusions must have a reasonable and adequate basis and
must be supported by appropriate research.
     Independent analysts must also strictly limit the type of compensation that they
accept for conducting issuer-paid research. Otherwise, the content and conclusions
of the reports could reasonably be expected to be determined or affected by com-
pensation from the sponsoring companies. Compensation that might influence the
research report could be direct, such as payment based on the conclusions of the
report, or indirect, such as stock warrants or other equity instruments that could
increase in value on the basis of positive coverage in the report. In such instances,
the independent analyst has an incentive to avoid including negative information
or making negative conclusions. Best practice is for independent analysts, prior to
writing their reports, to negotiate only a flat fee for their work that is not linked to
their conclusions or recommendations.

                         Travel Funding
                         The benefits related to accepting paid travel extend beyond the cost savings to the
                         member or candidate and his firm, such as the chance to talk exclusively with the
                         executives of a company or learning more about the investment options provided
                         by an investment organization. Acceptance also comes with potential concerns; for
                         example, members and candidates may be influenced by these discussions when fly-
                         ing on a corporate or chartered jet or attending sponsored conferences where many
                         expenses, including airfare and lodging, are covered. To avoid the appearance of com-
                         promising their independence and objectivity, best practice dictates that members and
                         candidates always use commercial transportation at their expense or at the expense
                         of their firm rather than accept paid travel arrangements from an outside company.
                         Should commercial transportation be unavailable, members and candidates may
                         accept modestly arranged travel to participate in appropriate information-gathering
                         events, such as a property tour.




             5           STANDARD I(B): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                         Members and candidates should adhere to the following practices and should encourage
                         their firms to establish procedures to avoid violations of Standard I(B):
                             ■   Protect the integrity of opinions: Members, candidates, and their firms
                                 should establish policies stating that every research report concerning the
                                 securities of a corporate client should reflect the unbiased opinion of the
                                 analyst. Firms should also design compensation systems that protect the
                                 integrity of the investment decision process by maintaining the indepen-
                                 dence and objectivity of analysts.
                             ■   Create a restricted list: If the firm is unwilling to permit dissemination of
                                 adverse opinions about a corporate client, members and candidates should
                                 encourage the firm to remove the controversial company from the research
                                 universe and put it on a restricted list so that the firm disseminates only
                                 factual information about the company.
                             ■   Restrict special cost arrangements: When attending meetings at an issuer’s
                                 headquarters, members and candidates should pay for commercial transpor-
                                 tation and hotel charges. No corporate issuer should reimburse members or
                                 candidates for air transportation. Members and candidates should encour-
                                 age issuers to limit the use of corporate aircraft to situations in which com-
                                 mercial transportation is not available or in which efficient movement could
                                 not otherwise be arranged. Members and candidates should take particular
                                 care that when frequent meetings are held between an individual issuer and
                                 an individual member or candidate, the issuer should not always host the
                                 member or candidate.
                             ■   Limit gifts: Members and candidates must limit the acceptance of gratuities
                                 and/or gifts to token items. Standard I(B) does not preclude customary,
                                 ordinary business-related entertainment as long as its purpose is not to
                                 influence or reward members or candidates. Firms should consider a strict
                                 value limit for acceptable gifts that is based on the local or regional customs
                                 and should address whether the limit is per gift or an aggregate annual
                                 value.
                             ■   Restrict investments: Members and candidates should encourage their
                                 investment firms to develop formal policies related to employee purchases
                                 of equity or equity-related IPOs. Firms should require prior approval for

       employee participation in IPOs, with prompt disclosure of investment
       actions taken following the offering. Strict limits should be imposed on
       investment personnel acquiring securities in private placements.
   ■   Review procedures: Members and candidates should encourage their firms to
       implement effective supervisory and review procedures to ensure that ana-
       lysts and portfolio managers comply with policies relating to their personal
       investment activities.
   ■   Independence policy: Members, candidates, and their firms should establish
       a formal written policy on the independence and objectivity of research
       and implement reporting structures and review procedures to ensure that
       research analysts do not report to and are not supervised or controlled by
       any department of the firm that could compromise the independence of the
       analyst. More detailed recommendations related to a firm’s policies regard-
       ing research objectivity are set forth in the CFA Institute statement Research
       Objectivity Standards (www​.cfainstitute​.org).
   ■   Appointed officer: Firms should appoint a senior officer with oversight
       responsibilities for compliance with the firm’s code of ethics and all regula-
       tions concerning its business. Firms should provide every employee with the
       procedures and policies for reporting potentially unethical behavior, viola-
       tions of regulations, or other activities that may harm the firm’s reputation.




STANDARD I(B): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                            6
Example 1 (Travel Expenses):
Steven Taylor, a mining analyst with Bronson Brokers, is invited by Precision Metals
to join a group of his peers in a tour of mining facilities in several western US states.
The company arranges for chartered group flights from site to site and for accom-
modations in Spartan Motels, the only chain with accommodations near the mines,
for three nights. Taylor allows Precision Metals to pick up his tab, as do the other
analysts, with one exception—John Adams, an employee of a large trust company
who insists on following his company’s policy and paying for his hotel room himself.
       Comment: The policy of the company where Adams works complies closely
       with Standard I(B) by avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest,
       but Taylor and the other analysts were not necessarily violating Standard
       I(B). In general, when allowing companies to pay for travel and/or accom-
       modations in these circumstances, members and candidates must use their
       judgment. They must be on guard that such arrangements not impinge on
       a member’s or candidate’s independence and objectivity. In this example,
       the trip was strictly for business and Taylor was not accepting irrelevant
       or lavish hospitality. The itinerary required chartered flights, for which
       analysts were not expected to pay. The accommodations were modest.
       These arrangements are not unusual and did not violate Standard I(B) as
       long as Taylor’s independence and objectivity were not compromised. In
       the final analysis, members and candidates should consider both whether
       they can remain objective and whether their integrity might be perceived
       by their clients to have been compromised.

                         Example 2 (Research Independence):
                         Susan Dillon, an analyst in the corporate finance department of an investment ser-
                         vices firm, is making a presentation to a potential new business client that includes
                         the promise that her firm will provide full research coverage of the potential client.
                                Comment: Dillon may agree to provide research coverage, but she must
                                not commit her firm’s research department to providing a favorable recom-
                                mendation. The firm’s recommendation (favorable, neutral, or unfavorable)
                                must be based on an independent and objective investigation and analysis
                                of the company and its securities.



                         Example 3 (Research Independence and Intrafirm Pressure):
                         Walter Fritz is an equity analyst with Hilton Brokerage who covers the mining industry.
                         He has concluded that the stock of Metals & Mining is overpriced at its current level,
                         but he is concerned that a negative research report will hurt the good relationship
                         between Metals & Mining and the investment banking division of his firm. In fact, a
                         senior manager of Hilton Brokerage has just sent him a copy of a proposal his firm
                         has made to Metals & Mining to underwrite a debt offering. Fritz needs to produce a
                         report right away and is concerned about issuing a less-than-favorable rating.
                                Comment: Fritz’s analysis of Metals & Mining must be objective and based
                                solely on consideration of company fundamentals. Any pressure from
                                other divisions of his firm is inappropriate. This conflict could have been
                                eliminated if, in anticipation of the offering, Hilton Brokerage had placed
                                Metals & Mining on a restricted list for its sales force.



                         Example 4 (Research Independence and Issuer Relationship
                         Pressure):
                         As in Example 3, Walter Fritz has concluded that Metals & Mining stock is overvalued
                         at its current level, but he is concerned that a negative research report might jeop-
                         ardize a close rapport that he has nurtured over the years with Metals & Mining’s
                         CEO, chief finance officer, and investment relations officer. Fritz is concerned that a
                         negative report might result also in management retaliation—for instance, cutting him
                         off from participating in conference calls when a quarterly earnings release is made,
                         denying him the ability to ask questions on such calls, and/or denying him access to
                         top management for arranging group meetings between Hilton Brokerage clients and
                         top Metals & Mining managers.
                                Comment: As in Example 3, Fritz’s analysis must be objective and based
                                solely on consideration of company fundamentals. Any pressure from
                                Metals & Mining is inappropriate. Fritz should reinforce the integrity of
                                his conclusions by stressing that his investment recommendation is based
                                on relative valuation, which may include qualitative issues with respect to
                                Metals & Mining’s management.



                         Example 5 (Research Independence and Sales Pressure):
                         As support for the sales effort of her corporate bond department, Lindsey Warner
                         offers credit guidance to purchasers of fixed-income securities. Her compensation is

end, Warner’s firm has a large inventory position in the bonds of Milton, Ltd., and has
been unable to sell the bonds because of Milton’s recent announcement of an oper-
ating problem. Salespeople have asked her to contact large clients to push the bonds.
       Comment: Unethical sales practices create significant potential violations
       of the Code and Standards. Warner’s opinion of the Milton bonds must
       not be affected by internal pressure or compensation. In this case, Warner
       must refuse to push the Milton bonds unless she is able to justify that the
       market price has already adjusted for the operating problem.



Example 6 (Research Independence and Prior Coverage):
Jill Jorund is a securities analyst following airline stocks and a rising star at her firm.
Her boss has been carrying a “buy” recommendation on International Airlines and
asks Jorund to take over coverage of that airline. He tells Jorund that under no cir-
cumstances should the prevailing buy recommendation be changed.
       Comment: Jorund must be independent and objective in her analysis of
       International Airlines. If she believes that her boss’s instructions have
       compromised her, she has two options: She can tell her boss that she
       cannot cover the company under these constraints, or she can take over
       coverage of the company, reach her own independent conclusions, and if
       they conflict with her boss’s opinion, share the conclusions with her boss
       or other supervisors in the firm so that they can make appropriate rec-
       ommendations. Jorund must issue only recommendations that reflect her
       independent and objective opinion.

Edward Grant directs a large amount of his commission business to a New York–based
brokerage house. In appreciation for all the business, the brokerage house gives Grant
two tickets to the World Cup in South Africa, two nights at a nearby resort, several
meals, and transportation via limousine to the game. Grant fails to disclose receiving
this package to his supervisor.
       Comment: Grant has violated Standard I(B) because accepting these sub-
       stantial gifts may impede his independence and objectivity. Every member
       and candidate should endeavor to avoid situations that might cause or be
       perceived to cause a loss of independence or objectivity in recommending
       investments or taking investment action. By accepting the trip, Grant has
       opened himself up to the accusation that he may give the broker favored
       treatment in return.



Example 8 (Gifts and Entertainment from Client):
Theresa Green manages the portfolio of Ian Knowlden, a client of Tisbury Investments.
Green achieves an annual return for Knowlden that is consistently better than that of
the benchmark she and the client previously agreed to. As a reward, Knowlden offers
Green two tickets to Wimbledon and the use of Knowlden’s flat in London for a week.
Green discloses this gift to her supervisor at Tisbury.
       Comment: Green is in compliance with Standard I(B) because she disclosed
       the gift from one of her clients in accordance with the firm’s policies.

                                as they disclose them to their employer because gifts in a client relationship
                                are deemed less likely to affect a member’s or candidate’s objectivity and
                                independence than gifts in other situations. Disclosure is required, however,
                                so that supervisors can monitor such situations to guard against employees
                                favoring a gift-giving client to the detriment of other fee-paying clients
                                (such as by allocating a greater proportion of IPO stock to the gift-giving
                                client’s portfolio).
                                    Best practices for monitoring include comparing the transaction costs
                                of the Knowlden account with the costs of other accounts managed by
                                Green and other similar accounts within Tisbury. The supervisor could also
                                compare the performance returns with the returns of other clients with
                                the same mandate. This comparison will assist in determining whether a
                                pattern of favoritism by Green is disadvantaging other Tisbury clients or
                                the possibility that this favoritism could affect her future behavior.


                         Example 9 (Travel Expenses from External Manager):
                         Tom Wayne is the investment manager of the Franklin City Employees Pension Plan.
                         He recently completed a successful search for a firm to manage the foreign equity
                         allocation of the plan’s diversified portfolio. He followed the plan’s standard proce-
                         dure of seeking presentations from a number of qualified firms and recommended
                         that his board select Penguin Advisors because of its experience, well-defined invest-
                         ment strategy, and performance record. The firm claims compliance with the Global
                         Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has been verified. Following the
                         selection of Penguin, a reporter from the Franklin City Record calls to ask if there was
                         any connection between this action and the fact that Penguin was one of the sponsors
                         of an “investment fact-finding trip to Asia” that Wayne made earlier in the year. The
                         trip was one of several conducted by the Pension Investment Academy, which had
                         arranged the itinerary of meetings with economic, government, and corporate officials
                         in major cities in several Asian countries. The Pension Investment Academy obtains
                         support for the cost of these trips from a number of investment managers, including
                         Penguin Advisors; the Academy then pays the travel expenses of the various pension
                         plan managers on the trip and provides all meals and accommodations. The president
                         of Penguin Advisors was also one of the travelers on the trip.
                                Comment: Although Wayne can probably put to good use the knowledge
                                he gained from the trip in selecting portfolio managers and in other areas
                                of managing the pension plan, his recommendation of Penguin Advisors
                                may be tainted by the possible conflict incurred when he participated in
                                a trip partly paid for by Penguin Advisors and when he was in the daily
                                company of the president of Penguin Advisors. To avoid violating Standard
                                I(B), Wayne’s basic expenses for travel and accommodations should have
                                been paid by his employer or the pension plan; contact with the president of
                                Penguin Advisors should have been limited to informational or educational
                                events only; and the trip, the organizer, and the sponsor should have been
                                made a matter of public record. Even if his actions were not in violation of
                                Standard I(B), Wayne should have been sensitive to the public perception
                                of the trip when reported in the newspaper and the extent to which the
                                subjective elements of his decision might have been affected by the famil-
                                iarity that the daily contact of such a trip would encourage. This advantage
                                would probably not be shared by firms competing with Penguin Advisors.

Example 10 (Research Independence and Compensation
Arrangements):
Javier Herrero recently left his job as a research analyst for a large investment adviser.
While looking for a new position, he was hired by an investor-relations firm to write
a research report on one of its clients, a small educational software company. The
investor-relations firm hopes to generate investor interest in the technology company.
The firm will pay Herrero a flat fee plus a bonus if any new investors buy stock in the
company as a result of Herrero’s report.
       Comment: If Herrero accepts this payment arrangement, he will be in
       violation of Standard I(B) because the compensation arrangement can
       reasonably be expected to compromise his independence and objectivity.
       Herrero will receive a bonus for attracting investors, which provides an
       incentive to draft a positive report regardless of the facts and to ignore or
       play down any negative information about the company. Herrero should
       accept only a flat fee that is not tied to the conclusions or recommendations
       of the report. Issuer-paid research that is objective and unbiased can be
       done under the right circumstances as long as the analyst takes steps to
       maintain his or her objectivity and includes in the report proper disclosures
       regarding potential conflicts of interest.



Example 11 (Recommendation Objectivity and Service Fees):
Two years ago, Bob Wade, trust manager for Central Midas Bank, was approached
by Western Funds about promoting its family of funds, with special interest in the
service-fee class of funds. To entice Central to promote this class, Western Funds
offered to pay the bank a service fee of 0.25%. Without disclosing the fee being offered
to the bank, Wade asked one of the investment managers to review Western’s funds
to determine whether they were suitable for clients of Central Midas Bank. The man-
ager completed the normal due diligence review and determined that the new funds
were fairly valued in the market with fee structures on a par with competitors. Wade
decided to accept Western’s offer and instructed the team of portfolio managers to
exclusively promote these funds and the service-fee class to clients seeking to invest
new funds or transfer from their current investments.
    Now, two years later, the funds managed by Western begin to underperform their
peers. Wade is counting on the fees to reach his profitability targets and continues to
push these funds as acceptable investments for Central’s clients.
       Comment: Wade is violating Standard I(B) because the fee arrangement
       has affected the objectivity of his recommendations. Wade is relying on
       the fee as a component of the department’s profitability and is unwilling
       to offer other products that may affect the fees received.

Example 12 (Recommendation Objectivity):
Bob Thompson has been doing research for the portfolio manager of the fixed-income
department. His assignment is to do sensitivity analysis on securitized subprime
mortgages. He has discussed with the manager possible scenarios to use to calculate
expected returns. A key assumption in such calculations is housing price appreciation
(HPA) because it drives “prepays” (prepayments of mortgages) and losses. Thompson
is concerned with the significant appreciation experienced over the previous five years
as a result of the increased availability of funds from subprime mortgages. Thompson

                         insists that the analysis should include a scenario run with –10% for Year 1, –5% for
                         Year 2, and then (to project a worst-case scenario) 0% for Years 3 through 5. The
                         manager replies that these assumptions are too dire because there has never been a
                         time in their available database when HPA was negative.
                             Thompson conducts his research to better understand the risks inherent in these
                         securities and evaluates these securities in the worst-case scenario, an unlikely but
                         possible environment. Based on the results of the enhanced scenarios, Thompson
                         does not recommend the purchase of the securitization. Against the general market
                         trends, the manager follows Thompson’s recommendation and does not invest. The
                         following year, the housing market collapses. In avoiding the subprime investments,
                         the manager’s portfolio outperforms its peer group that year.
                                Comment: Thompson’s actions in running the worst-case scenario against
                                the protests of the portfolio manager are in alignment with the principles
                                of Standard I(B). Thompson did not allow his research to be pressured
                                by the general trends of the market or the manager’s desire to limit the
                                research to historical norms.

                         Example 13 (Influencing Manager Selection Decisions):
                         Adrian Mandel, CFA, is a senior portfolio manager for ZZYY Capital Management
                         who oversees a team of investment professionals who manage labor union pension
                         funds. A few years ago, ZZYY sought to win a competitive asset manager search to
                         manage a significant allocation of the pension fund of the United Doughnut and Pretzel
                         Bakers Union (UDPBU). UDPBU’s investment board is chaired by a recognized key
                         decision maker and long-time leader of the union, Ernesto Gomez. To improve ZZYY’s
                         chances of winning the competition, Mandel made significant monetary contributions
                         to Gomez’s union reelection campaign fund. Even after ZZYY was hired as a primary
                         manager of the pension, Mandel believed that his firm’s position was not secure. Mandel
                         continued to contribute to Gomez’s reelection campaign chest as well as to entertain
                         lavishly the union leader and his family at top restaurants on a regular basis. All of
                         Mandel’s outlays were routinely handled as marketing expenses reimbursed by ZZYY’s
                         expense accounts and were disclosed to his senior management as being instrumental
                         in maintaining a strong close relationship with an important client.
                                Comment: Mandel not only offered but actually gave monetary gifts, benefits,
                                and other considerations that reasonably could be expected to compromise
                                Gomez’s objectivity. Therefore, Mandel was in violation of Standard I(B).



                         Example 14 (Influencing Manager Selection Decisions):
                         Adrian Mandel, CFA, had heard about the manager search competition for the
                         UDPBU Pension Fund through a broker/dealer contact. The contact told him that a
                         well-known retired professional golfer, Bobby “The Bear” Finlay, who had become a
                         licensed broker/dealer serving as a pension consultant, was orchestrating the UDPBU
                         manager search. Finlay had gained celebrity status with several labor union pension
                         fund boards by entertaining their respective board members and regaling them with
                         colorful stories of fellow pro golfers’ antics in clubhouses around the world. Mandel
                         decided to improve ZZYY’s chances of being invited to participate in the search compe-
                         tition by befriending Finlay to curry his favor. Knowing Finlay’s love of entertainment,
                         Mandel wined and dined Finlay at high-profile bistros where Finlay could glow in the

fan recognition lavished on him by all the other patrons. Mandel’s endeavors paid off
handsomely when Finlay recommended to the UDPBU board that ZZYY be entered
as one of three finalist asset management firms in its search.
       Comment: Similar to Example 13, Mandel lavished gifts, benefits, and other
       considerations in the form of expensive entertainment that could reasonably
       be expected to influence the consultant to recommend the hiring of his
       firm. Therefore, Mandel was in violation of Standard I(B).



Example 15 (Fund Manager Relationships):
Amie Scott is a performance analyst within her firm with responsibilities for analyz-
ing the performance of external managers. While completing her quarterly analysis,
Scott notices a change in one manager’s reported composite construction. The change
concealed the bad performance of a particularly large account by placing that account
into a new residual composite. This change allowed the manager to remain at the top
of the list of manager performance. Scott knows her firm has a large allocation to this
manager, and the fund’s manager is a close personal friend of the CEO. She needs
to deliver her final report but is concerned with pointing out the composite change.
       Comment: Scott would be in violation of Standard I(B) if she did not disclose
       the change in her final report. The analysis of managers’ performance should
       not be influenced by personal relationships or the size of the allocation to
       the outside managers. By not including the change, Scott would not be
       providing an independent analysis of the performance metrics for her firm.



Example 16 (Intrafirm Pressure):
Jill Stein is head of performance measurement for her firm. During the last quarter,
many members of the organization’s research department were removed because of
the poor quality of their recommendations. The subpar research caused one larger
account holder to experience significant underperformance, which resulted in the
client withdrawing his money after the end of the quarter. The head of sales requests
that Stein remove this account from the firm’s performance composite because the
performance decline can be attributed to the departed research team and not the
client’s adviser.
       Comment: Pressure from other internal departments can create situations
       that cause a member or candidate to violate the Code and Standards. Stein
       must maintain her independence and objectivity and refuse to exclude
       specific accounts from the firm’s performance composites to which they
       belong. As long as the client invested under a strategy similar to that of
       the defined composite, it cannot be excluded because of the poor stock
       selections that led to the underperformance and asset withdrawal.

                         documents, company financial reports, market letters, newspaper columns, and books.

                         should regularly monitor materials posted on these sites to ensure that they contain
                         current information. Members and candidates should also ensure that all reasonable
                         precautions have been taken to protect the site’s integrity and security and that the
                         site does not misrepresent any information and does provide full disclosure.

Standard I(C) Misrepresentation                                                                77


    Standard I(C) prohibits members and candidates from guaranteeing clients any
specific return on volatile investments. Most investments contain some element of
risk that makes their return inherently unpredictable. For such investments, guaran-
teeing either a particular rate of return or preservation of investment capital (e.g., “I
can guarantee that you will earn 8% on equities this year” or “I can guarantee that
you will not lose money on this investment”) is misleading to investors. Standard I(C)
does not prohibit members and candidates from providing clients with information
on investment products that have guarantees built into the structure of the products
themselves or for which an institution has agreed to cover any losses.

Impact on Investment Practice
Members and candidates must not misrepresent any aspect of their practice, including
(but not limited to) their qualifications or credentials, the qualifications or services
provided by their firm, their performance record and the record of their firm, and
the characteristics of an investment. Any misrepresentation made by a member or
candidate relating to the member’s or candidate’s professional activities is a breach
of this standard.
    Members and candidates should exercise care and diligence when incorporating
third-party information. Misrepresentations resulting from the use of the credit
ratings, research, testimonials, or marketing materials of outside parties become
the responsibility of the investment professional when it affects that professional’s
business practices.
    Investing through outside managers continues to expand as an acceptable method
of investing in areas outside a firm’s core competencies. Members and candidates must
disclose their intended use of external managers and must not represent those man-
agers’ investment practices as their own. Although the level of involvement of outside
managers may change over time, appropriate disclosures by members and candidates
are important in avoiding misrepresentations, especially if the primary activity is to
invest directly with a single external manager. Standard V(B) Communication with
Clients and Prospective Clients discusses in further detail communicating the firm’s
investment practices.

Performance Reporting
The performance benchmark selection process is another area where misrepresen-
tations may occur. Members and candidates may misrepresent the success of their
performance record through presenting benchmarks that are not comparable to their
strategies. Further, clients can be misled if the benchmark’s results are not reported on
a basis comparable to that of the fund’s or client’s results. Best practice is selecting the
most appropriate available benchmark from a universe of available options. The trans-
parent presentation of appropriate performance benchmarks is an important aspect
in providing clients with information that is useful in making investment decisions.
    However, Standard I(C) does not require that a benchmark always be provided in
order to comply. Some investment strategies may not lend themselves to displaying
an appropriate benchmark because of the complexity or diversity of the investments
included. Furthermore, some investment strategies may use reference indexes that
do not reflect the opportunity set of the invested assets—for example, a hedge fund
comparing its performance with a “cash plus” basis. When such a benchmark is used,
members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to ensure that they disclose
the reasons behind the use of this reference index to avoid misrepresentations of their
performance. Members and candidates should discuss with clients on a continuous
basis the appropriate benchmark to be used for performance evaluations and related
fee calculations.

                             Reporting misrepresentations may also occur when valuations for illiquid or
                         non-traded securities are available from more than one source. When different options
                         are available, members and candidates may be tempted to switch providers to obtain
                         higher security valuations. The process of shopping for values may misrepresent a
                         security’s worth, lead to misinformed decisions to sell or hold an investment, and
                         result in overcharging clients advisory fees.
                             Members and candidates should take reasonable steps to provide accurate and
                         reliable security pricing information to clients on a consistent basis. Changing pric-
                         ing providers should not be based solely on the justification that the new provider
                         reports a higher current value of a security. Consistency in the reported information
                         will improve the perception of the valuation process for illiquid securities. Clients will
                         likely have additional confidence that they were able to make an informed decision
                         about continuing to hold these securities in their portfolios.

                         Social Media
                         The advancement of online discussion forums and communication platforms, com-
                         monly referred to as “social media,” is placing additional responsibilities on members
                         and candidates. When communicating through social media channels, members and
                         candidates should provide only the same information they are allowed to distribute
                         to clients and potential clients through other, traditional forms of communication.
                         The online or interactive aspects of social media do not remove the need to be open
                         and honest about the information being distributed.
                             Along with understanding and following existing and newly developing rules and
                         regulations regarding the allowed use of social media, members and candidates should
                         also ensure that all communications in this format adhere to the requirements of the
                         Code and Standards. The perceived anonymity granted through these platforms may
                         entice individuals to misrepresent their qualifications or abilities or those of their
                         employer. Actions undertaken through social media that knowingly misrepresent
                         investment recommendations or professional activities are considered a violation of
                         Standard I(C).

                         Omissions
                         The omission of a fact or outcome can be misleading, especially given the growing
                         use of models and technical analysis processes. Many members and candidates rely
                         on such models and processes to scan for new investment opportunities, to develop
                         investment vehicles, and to produce investment recommendations and ratings.
                         When inputs are knowingly omitted, the resulting outcomes may provide misleading
                         information to those who rely on it for making investment decisions. Additionally,
                         the outcomes from models shall not be presented as fact because they represent the
                         expected results based on the inputs and analysis process incorporated.
                             Omissions in the performance measurement and attribution process can also
                         misrepresent a manager’s performance and skill. Members and candidates should
                         encourage their firms to develop strict policies for composite development to prevent
                         cherry picking—situations in which selected accounts are presented as representa-
                         tive of the firm’s abilities. The omission of any accounts appropriate for the defined
                         composite may misrepresent to clients the success of the manager’s implementation
                         of its strategy.

                         Plagiarism
                         Standard I(C) also prohibits plagiarism in the preparation of material for distribution to
                         employers, associates, clients, prospects, or the general public. Plagiarism is defined as
                         copying or using in substantially the same form materials prepared by others without
                         acknowledging the source of the material or identifying the author and publisher of

Standard I(C) Misrepresentation                                                             79


such material. Members and candidates must not copy (or represent as their own)
original ideas or material without permission and must acknowledge and identify the
source of ideas or material that is not their own.
    The investment profession uses a myriad of financial, economic, and statistical
data in the investment decision-making process. Through various publications and
presentations, the investment professional is constantly exposed to the work of others
and to the temptation to use that work without proper acknowledgment.
    Misrepresentation through plagiarism in investment management can take various
forms. The simplest and most flagrant example is to take a research report or study
done by another firm or person, change the names, and release the material as one’s
own original analysis. This action is a clear violation of Standard I(C). Other practices
include (1) using excerpts from articles or reports prepared by others either verbatim
or with only slight changes in wording without acknowledgment, (2) citing specific
quotations as attributable to “leading analysts” and “investment experts” without nam-
ing the specific references, (3) presenting statistical estimates of forecasts prepared
by others and identifying the sources but without including the qualifying statements
or caveats that may have been used, (4) using charts and graphs without stating their
sources, and (5) copying proprietary computerized spreadsheets or algorithms without
seeking the cooperation or authorization of their creators.
    In the case of distributing third-party, outsourced research, members and candi-
dates may use and distribute such reports as long as they do not represent themselves
as the report’s authors. Indeed, the member or candidate may add value for the client
by sifting through research and repackaging it for clients. In such cases, clients should
be fully informed that they are paying for the ability of the member or candidate to
find the best research from a wide variety of sources. Members and candidates must
not misrepresent their abilities, the extent of their expertise, or the extent of their
work in a way that would mislead their clients or prospective clients. Members and
candidates should disclose whether the research being presented to clients comes
from another source—from either within or outside the member’s or candidate’s firm.
This allows clients to understand who has the expertise behind the report or whether
the work is being done by the analyst, other members of the firm, or an outside party.
    Standard I(C) also applies to plagiarism in oral communications, such as through
group meetings; visits with associates, clients, and customers; use of audio/video
media (which is rapidly increasing); and telecommunications, including electronic
data transfer and the outright copying of electronic media.
    One of the most egregious practices in violation of this standard is the preparation
of research reports based on multiple sources of information without acknowledging
the sources. Examples of information from such sources include ideas, statistical com-
pilations, and forecasts combined to give the appearance of original work. Although
there is no monopoly on ideas, members and candidates must give credit where it is
clearly due. Analysts should not use undocumented forecasts, earnings projections,
asset values, and so on. Sources must be revealed to bring the responsibility directly
back to the author of the report or the firm involved.

Work Completed for Employer
The preceding paragraphs address actions that would constitute a violation of Standard
I(C). In some situations, however, members or candidates may use research conducted
or models developed by others within the same firm without committing a violation.
The most common example relates to the situation in which one (or more) of the
original analysts is no longer with the firm. Research and models developed while
employed by a firm are the property of the firm. The firm retains the right to continue
using the work completed after a member or candidate has left the organization. The

                         firm may issue future reports without providing attribution to the prior analysts. A
                         member or candidate cannot, however, reissue a previously released report solely
                         under his or her name.

                         Factual Presentations
                         Members and candidates can prevent unintentional misrepresentations of their qual-
                         ifications or the services they or their firms provide if each member and candidate
                         understands the limit of the firm’s or individual’s capabilities and the need to be accurate
                         and complete in presentations. Firms can provide guidance for employees who make
                         written or oral presentations to clients or potential clients by providing a written list
                         of the firm’s available services and a description of the firm’s qualifications. This list
                         should suggest ways of describing the firm’s services, qualifications, and compensation
                         that are both accurate and suitable for client or customer presentations. Firms can
                         also help prevent misrepresentation by specifically designating which employees are
                         authorized to speak on behalf of the firm. Regardless of whether the firm provides
                         guidance, members and candidates should make certain that they understand the
                         services the firm can perform and its qualifications.


                         Qualification Summary
                         In addition, to ensure accurate presentations to clients, each member and candidate
                         should prepare a summary of his or her own qualifications and experience and a list
                         of the services the member or candidate is capable of performing. Firms can assist
                         member and candidate compliance by periodically reviewing employee correspon-
                         dence and documents that contain representations of individual or firm qualifications.


                         Verify Outside Information
                         When providing information to clients from a third party, members and candidates
                         share a responsibility for the accuracy of the marketing and distribution materials that
                         pertain to the third party’s capabilities, services, and products. Misrepresentation by
                         third parties can damage the member’s or candidate’s reputation, the reputation of the
                         firm, and the integrity of the capital markets. Members and candidates should encour-
                         age their employers to develop procedures for verifying information of third-party firms.


                         Maintain Webpages
                         Members and candidates who publish a webpage should regularly monitor materials
                         posted on the site to ensure that the site contains current information. Members
                         and candidates should also ensure that all reasonable precautions have been taken
                         to protect the site’s integrity, confidentiality, and security and that the site does not
                         misrepresent any information and provides full disclosure.

Plagiarism Policy
To avoid plagiarism in preparing research reports or conclusions of analysis, members
and candidates should take the following steps:
   ■   Maintain copies: Keep copies of all research reports, articles containing
       research ideas, material with new statistical methodologies, and other mate-
       rials that were relied on in preparing the research report.
   ■   Attribute quotations: Attribute to their sources any direct quotations,
       including projections, tables, statistics, model/product ideas, and new meth-
       odologies prepared by persons other than recognized financial and statisti-
       cal reporting services or similar sources.
   ■   Attribute summaries: Attribute to their sources any paraphrases or summa-
       ries of material prepared by others. For example, to support his analysis of
       Brown Company’s competitive position, the author of a research report on
       Brown might summarize another analyst’s report on Brown’s chief competi-
       tor, but the author of the Brown report must acknowledge in his own report
       the reliance on the other analyst’s report.

Example 1 (Disclosure of Issuer-Paid Research):
Anthony McGuire is an issuer-paid analyst hired by publicly traded companies to
electronically promote their stocks. McGuire creates a website that promotes his
research efforts as a seemingly independent analyst. McGuire posts a profile and a
strong buy recommendation for each company on the website indicating that the stock
is expected to increase in value. He does not disclose the contractual relationships
with the companies he covers on his website, in the research reports he issues, or in
the statements he makes about the companies in internet chat rooms.
       Comment: McGuire has violated Standard I(C) because the website is
       misleading to potential investors. Even if the recommendations are valid
       and supported with thorough research, his omissions regarding the true
       relationship between himself and the companies he covers constitute a
       misrepresentation. McGuire has also violated Standard VI(A) Disclosure of
       Conflicts by not disclosing the existence of an arrangement with the compa-
       nies through which he receives compensation in exchange for his services.



Example 2 (Correction of Unintentional Errors):
Hijan Yao is responsible for the creation and distribution of the marketing materials
for his firm, which claims compliance with the GIPS standards. Yao creates and dis-
tributes a presentation of performance by the firm’s Asian equity composite that states
the composite has ¥350 billion in assets. In fact, the composite has only ¥35 billion in
assets, and the higher figure on the presentation is a result of a typographical error.
Nevertheless, the erroneous material is distributed to a number of clients before Yao
catches the mistake.

                                Comment: Once the error is discovered, Yao must take steps to cease
                                distribution of the incorrect material and correct the error by informing
                                those who have received the erroneous information. Because Yao did not
                                knowingly make the misrepresentation, however, he did not violate Standard
                                I(C). Because his firm claims compliance with the GIPS standards, it must
                                also comply with the GIPS Guidance Statement on Error Correction in
                                relation to the error.



                         Example 3 (Noncorrection of Known Errors):
                         Syed Muhammad is the president of an investment management firm. The promo-
                         tional material for the firm, created by the firm’s marketing department, incorrectly
                         claims that Muhammad has an advanced degree in finance from a prestigious business
                         school in addition to the CFA designation. Although Muhammad attended the school
                         for a short period of time, he did not receive a degree. Over the years, Muhammad
                         and others in the firm have distributed this material to numerous prospective clients
                         and consultants.
                                Comment: Even though Muhammad may not have been directly respon-
                                sible for the misrepresentation of his credentials in the firm’s promotional
                                material, he used this material numerous times over an extended period
                                and should have known of the misrepresentation. Thus, Muhammad has
                                violated Standard I(C).


                         Example 4 (Plagiarism):
                         Cindy Grant, a research analyst for a Canadian brokerage firm, has specialized in the
                         Canadian mining industry for the past 10 years. She recently read an extensive research
                         report on Jefferson Mining, Ltd., by Jeremy Barton, another analyst. Barton provided
                         extensive statistics on the mineral reserves, production capacity, selling rates, and
                         marketing factors affecting Jefferson’s operations. He also noted that initial drilling
                         results on a new ore body, which had not been made public, might show the existence
                         of mineral zones that could increase the life of Jefferson’s main mines, but Barton cited
                         no specific data as to the initial drilling results. Grant called an officer of Jefferson,
                         who gave her the initial drilling results over the telephone. The data indicated that
                         the expected life of the main mines would be tripled. Grant added these statistics to
                         Barton’s report and circulated it within her firm as her own report.
                                Comment: Grant plagiarized Barton’s report by reproducing large parts of
                                it in her own report without acknowledgment.



                         Example 5 (Misrepresentation of Information):
                         When Ricki Marks sells mortgage-backed derivatives called “interest-only strips” (IOs)
                         to public pension plan clients, she describes them as “guaranteed by the US govern-
                         ment.” Purchasers of the IOs are entitled only to the interest stream generated by the
                         mortgages, however, not the notional principal itself. One particular municipality’s
                         investment policies and local law require that securities purchased by its public pen-
                         sion plans be guaranteed by the US government. Although the underlying mortgages
                         are guaranteed, neither the investor’s investment nor the interest stream on the IOs
                         is guaranteed. When interest rates decline, causing an increase in prepayment of
                         mortgages, interest payments to the IOs’ investors decline, and these investors lose
                         a portion of their investment.

Example 6 (Potential Information Misrepresentation):
Khalouck Abdrabbo manages the investments of several high-net-worth individuals in
the United States who are approaching retirement. Abdrabbo advises these individuals
that a portion of their investments be moved from equity to bank-sponsored certificates
of deposit and money market accounts so that the principal will be “guaranteed” up
to a certain amount. The interest is not guaranteed.
       Comment: Although there is risk that the institution offering the certifi-
       cates of deposits and money market accounts could go bankrupt, in the
       United States, these accounts are insured by the US government through
       the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Therefore, using the term
       “guaranteed” in this context is not inappropriate as long as the amount is
       within the government-insured limit. Abdrabbo should explain these facts
       to the clients.

Steve Swanson is a senior analyst in the investment research department of Ballard
and Company. Apex Corporation has asked Ballard to assist in acquiring the majority
ownership of stock in the Campbell Company, a financial consulting firm, and to pre-
pare a report recommending that stockholders of Campbell agree to the acquisition.
Another investment firm, Davis and Company, had already prepared a report for Apex
analyzing both Apex and Campbell and recommending an exchange ratio. Apex has
given the Davis report to Ballard officers, who have passed it on to Swanson. Swanson
reviews the Davis report and other available material on Apex and Campbell. From
his analysis, he concludes that the common stocks of Campbell and Apex represent
good value at their current prices; he believes, however, that the Davis report does
not consider all the factors a Campbell stockholder would need to know to make a
decision. Swanson reports his conclusions to the partner in charge, who tells him to
“use the Davis report, change a few words, sign your name, and get it out.”
       Comment: If Swanson does as requested, he will violate Standard I(C).
       He could refer to those portions of the Davis report that he agrees with if
       he identifies Davis as the source; he could then add his own analysis and
       conclusions to the report before signing and distributing it.

Claude Browning, a quantitative analyst for Double Alpha, Inc., returns from a seminar
in great excitement. At that seminar, Jack Jorrely, a well-known quantitative analyst
at a national brokerage firm, discussed one of his new models in great detail, and
Browning is intrigued by the new concepts. He proceeds to test the model, making
some minor mechanical changes but retaining the concepts, until he produces some
very positive results. Browning quickly announces to his supervisors at Double Alpha
that he has discovered a new model and that clients and prospective clients should
be informed of this positive finding as ongoing proof of Double Alpha’s continuing
innovation and ability to add value.

                                Comment: Although Browning tested Jorrely’s model on his own and even
                                slightly modified it, he must still acknowledge the original source of the
                                idea. Browning can certainly take credit for the final, practical results;
                                he can also support his conclusions with his own test. The credit for the
                                innovative thinking, however, must be awarded to Jorrely.

                         Fernando Zubia would like to include in his firm’s marketing materials some
                         “plain-language” descriptions of various concepts, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E)
                         multiple and why standard deviation is used as a measure of risk. The descriptions
                         come from other sources, but Zubia wishes to use them without reference to the
                         original authors. Would this use of material be a violation of Standard I(C)?
                                Comment: Copying verbatim any material without acknowledgement,
                                including plain-language descriptions of the P/E multiple and standard
                                deviation, violates Standard I(C). Even though these concepts are general,
                                best practice would be for Zubia to describe them in his own words or
                                cite the sources from which the descriptions are quoted. Members and
                                candidates would be violating Standard I(C) if they either were responsi-
                                ble for creating marketing materials without attribution or knowingly use
                                plagiarized materials.



                         Example 10 (Plagiarism):
                         Through a mainstream media outlet, Erika Schneider learns about a study that she
                         would like to cite in her research. Should she cite both the mainstream intermediary
                         source as well as the author of the study itself when using that information?
                                Comment: In all instances, a member or candidate must cite the actual
                                source of the information. Best practice for Schneider would be to obtain
                                the information directly from the author and review it before citing it in
                                a report. In that case, Schneider would not need to report how she found
                                out about the information. For example, suppose Schneider read in the
                                Financial Times about a study issued by CFA Institute; best practice for
                                Schneider would be to obtain a copy of the study from CFA Institute, review
                                it, and then cite it in her report. If she does not use any interpretation of
                                the report from the Financial Times and the newspaper does not add value
                                to the report itself, the newspaper is merely a conduit of the original infor-
                                mation and does not need to be cited. If she does not obtain the report and
                                review the information, Schneider runs the risk of relying on second-hand
                                information that may misstate facts. If, for example, the Financial Times
                                erroneously reported some information from the original CFA Institute
                                study and Schneider copied that erroneous information without acknowl-
                                edging CFA Institute, she could be the object of complaints. Best practice
                                would be either to obtain the complete study from its original author and
                                cite only that author or to use the information provided by the intermediary
                                and cite both sources.

Example 11 (Misrepresentation of Information):
Paul Ostrowski runs a two-person investment management firm. Ostrowski’s firm
subscribes to a service from a large investment research firm that provides research
reports that can be repackaged by smaller firms for those firms’ clients. Ostrowski’s
firm distributes these reports to clients as its own work.
       Comment: Ostrowski can rely on third-party research that has a reason-
       able and adequate basis, but he cannot imply that he is the author of such
       research. If he does, Ostrowski is misrepresenting the extent of his work
       in a way that misleads the firm’s clients or prospective clients.



Example 12 (Misrepresentation of Information):
Tom Stafford is part of a team within Appleton Investment Management responsible
for managing a pool of assets for Open Air Bank, which distributes structured securi-
ties to offshore clients. He becomes aware that Open Air is promoting the structured
securities as a much less risky investment than the investment management policy
followed by him and the team to manage the original pool of assets. Also, Open Air
has procured an independent rating for the pool that significantly overstates the
quality of the investments. Stafford communicates his concerns to his supervisor,
who responds that Open Air owns the product and is responsible for all marketing
and distribution. Stafford’s supervisor goes on to say that the product is outside of
the US regulatory regime that Appleton follows and that all risks of the product are
disclosed at the bottom of page 184 of the prospectus.
       Comment: As a member of the investment team, Stafford is qualified to
       recognize the degree of accuracy of the materials that characterize the
       portfolio, and he is correct to be worried about Appleton’s responsibility
       for a misrepresentation of the risks. Thus, he should continue to pursue
       the issue of Open Air’s inaccurate promotion of the portfolio according to
       the firm’s policies and procedures.
           The Code and Standards stress protecting the reputation of the firm and
       the sustainability and integrity of the capital markets. Misrepresenting the
       quality and risks associated with the investment pool may lead to negative
       consequences for others well beyond the direct investors.



Example 13 (Avoiding a Misrepresentation):
Trina Smith is a fixed-income portfolio manager at a pension fund. She has observed
that the market for highly structured mortgages is the focus of salespeople she meets
and that these products represent a significant number of trading opportunities. In
discussions about this topic with her team, Smith learns that calculating yields on
changing cash flows within the deal structure requires very specialized vendor software.
After more research, they find out that each deal is unique and that deals can have
more than a dozen layers and changing cash flow priorities. Smith comes to the con-
clusion that, because of the complexity of these securities, the team cannot effectively
distinguish between potentially good and bad investment options. To avoid misrep-
resenting their understanding, the team decides that the highly structured mortgage
segment of the securitized market should not become part of the core of the fund’s
portfolio; they will allow some of the less complex securities to be part of the core.

                                Comment: Smith is in compliance with Standard I(C) by not investing in
                                securities that she and her team cannot effectively understand. Because
                                she is not able to describe the risk and return profile of the securities to
                                the pension fund beneficiaries and trustees, she appropriately limits the
                                fund’s exposure to this sector.



                         Example 14 (Misrepresenting Composite Construction):
                         Robert Palmer is head of performance for a fund manager. When asked to provide
                         performance numbers to fund rating agencies, he avoids mentioning that the fund
                         manager is quite liberal in composite construction. The reason accounts are included/
                         excluded is not fully explained. The performance values reported to the rating agencies
                         for the composites, although accurate for the accounts shown each period, may not
                         present a true representation of the fund manager’s ability.
                                Comment: “Cherry picking” accounts to include in either published reports
                                or information provided to rating agencies conflicts with Standard I(C).
                                Moving accounts into or out of a composite to influence the overall per-
                                formance results materially misrepresents the reported values over time.
                                Palmer should work with his firm to strengthen its reporting practices
                                concerning composite construction to avoid misrepresenting the firm’s
                                track record or the quality of the information being provided.



                         Example 15 (Presenting Out-of-Date Information):
                         David Finch is a sales director at a commercial bank, where he directs the bank’s client
                         advisers in the sale of third-party mutual funds. Each quarter, he holds a division-wide
                         training session where he provides fact sheets on investment funds the bank is allowed
                         to offer to clients. These fact sheets, which can be redistributed to potential clients,
                         are created by the fund firms and contain information about the funds, including
                         investment strategy and target distribution rates.
                             Finch knows that some of the fact sheets are out of date; for example, one long-only
                         fund approved the use of significant leverage last quarter as a method to enhance
                         returns. He continues to provide the sheets to the sales team without updates because
                         the bank has no control over the marketing material released by the mutual fund firms.
                                Comment: Finch is violating Standard I(C) by providing information that
                                misrepresents aspects of the funds. By not providing the sales team and,
                                ultimately, the clients with the updated information, he is misrepresenting
                                the potential risks associated with the funds with outdated fact sheets. Finch
                                can instruct the sales team to clarify the deficiencies in the fact sheets with
                                clients and ensure they have the most recent fund prospectus document
                                before accepting orders for investing in any fund.



                         Example 16 (Overemphasis of Firm Results):
                         Bob Anderson is chief compliance officer for Optima Asset Management Company,
                         a firm currently offering eight funds to clients. Seven of the eight had 10-year returns
                         below the median for their respective sectors. Anderson approves a recent advertise-
                         ment, which includes this statement: “Optima Asset Management is achieving excellent
                         returns for its investors. The Optima Emerging Markets Equity fund, for example, has
                         10-year returns that exceed the sector median by more than 10%.”

       Comment: From the information provided it is difficult to determine whether
       a violation has occurred as long as the sector outperformance is correct.
       Anderson may be attempting to mislead potential clients by citing the
       performance of the sole fund that achieved such results. Past performance
       is often used to demonstrate a firm’s skill and abilities in comparison to
       funds in the same sectors.
           However, if all the funds outperformed their respective benchmarks,
       then Anderson’s assertion that the company “is achieving excellent returns”
       may be factual. Funds may exhibit positive returns for investors, exceed
       benchmarks, and yet have returns below the median in their sectors.
           Members and candidates need to ensure that their marketing efforts
       do not include statements that misrepresent their skills and abilities to
       remain compliant with Standard I(C). Unless the returns of a single fund
       reflect the performance of a firm as a whole, the use of a singular fund for
       performance comparisons should be avoided.




STANDARD I(D) MISCONDUCT

   professional reputation, integrity, or competence.



Guidance
Whereas Standard I(A) addresses the obligation of members and candidates to comply
with applicable law that governs their professional activities, Standard I(D) addresses
all conduct that reflects poorly on the professional integrity, good reputation, or
competence of members and candidates. Any act that involves lying, cheating, steal-
ing, or other dishonest conduct is a violation of this standard if the offense reflects
adversely on a member’s or candidate’s professional activities. Although CFA Institute
discourages any sort of unethical behavior by members and candidates, the Code
and Standards are primarily aimed at conduct and actions related to a member’s or
candidate’s professional life.
    Conduct that damages trustworthiness or competence may include behavior that,
although not illegal, nevertheless negatively affects a member’s or candidate’s ability to
perform his or her responsibilities. For example, abusing alcohol during business hours
might constitute a violation of this standard because it could have a detrimental effect
on the member’s or candidate’s ability to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities.

                             In some cases, the absence of appropriate conduct or the lack of sufficient effort

                         on trust. A member or candidate—whether an investment banker, rating or research
                         analyst, or portfolio manager—is expected to conduct the necessary due diligence to
                         properly understand the nature and risks of an investment before making an investment
                         recommendation. By not taking these steps and, instead, relying on someone else in
                         the process to perform them, members or candidates may violate the trust their clients
                         have placed in them. This loss of trust may have a significant impact on the reputation
                         of the member or candidate and the operations of the financial market as a whole.
                             Individuals may attempt to abuse the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program
                         by actively seeking CFA Institute enforcement of the Code and Standards, and Standard
                         I(D) in particular, as a method of settling personal, political, or other disputes unrelated
                         to professional ethics. CFA Institute is aware of this issue, and appropriate disciplinary
                         policies, procedures, and enforcement mechanisms are in place to address misuse of
                         the Code and Standards and the Professional Conduct Program in this way.




           11            STANDARD I(D): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                         In addition to ensuring that their own behavior is consistent with Standard I(D), to
                         prevent general misconduct, members and candidates should encourage their firms to
                         adopt the following policies and procedures to support the principles of Standard I(D):
                             ■   Code of ethics: Develop and/or adopt a code of ethics to which every
                                 employee must subscribe, and make clear that any personal behavior that
                                 reflects poorly on the individual involved, the institution as a whole, or the
                                 investment industry will not be tolerated.
                             ■   List of violations: Disseminate to all employees a list of potential violations
                                 and associated disciplinary sanctions, up to and including dismissal from
                                 the firm.
                             ■   Employee references: Check references of potential employees to ensure
                                 that they are of good character and not ineligible to work in the investment
                                 industry because of past infractions of the law.




           12            STANDARD I(D): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                         Example 1 (Professionalism and Competence):
                         Simon Sasserman is a trust investment officer at a bank in a small affluent town. He
                         enjoys lunching every day with friends at the country club, where his clients have
                         observed him having numerous drinks. Back at work after lunch, he clearly is intoxi-
                         cated while making investment decisions. His colleagues make a point of handling any
                         business with Sasserman in the morning because they distrust his judgment after lunch.

Standard I(D): Application of the Standard                                                89


       Comment: Sasserman’s excessive drinking at lunch and subsequent intoxi-
       cation at work constitute a violation of Standard I(D) because this conduct
       has raised questions about his professionalism and competence. His behavior
       reflects poorly on him, his employer, and the investment industry.



Example 2 (Fraud and Deceit):
Howard Hoffman, a security analyst at ATZ Brothers, Inc., a large brokerage house,
submits reimbursement forms over a two-year period to ATZ’s self-funded health
insurance program for more than two dozen bills, most of which have been altered
to increase the amount due. An investigation by the firm’s director of employee ben-
efits uncovers the inappropriate conduct. ATZ subsequently terminates Hoffman’s
employment and notifies CFA Institute.
       Comment: Hoffman violated Standard I(D) because he engaged in inten-
       tional conduct involving fraud and deceit in the workplace that adversely
       reflected on his integrity.


Example 3 (Fraud and Deceit):
Jody Brink, an analyst covering the automotive industry, volunteers much of her
spare time to local charities. The board of one of the charitable institutions decides
to buy five new vans to deliver hot lunches to low-income elderly people. Brink offers
to donate her time to handle purchasing agreements. To pay a long-standing debt to
a friend who operates an automobile dealership—and to compensate herself for her
trouble—she agrees to a price 20% higher than normal and splits the surcharge with
her friend. The director of the charity ultimately discovers the scheme and tells Brink
that her services, donated or otherwise, are no longer required.
       Comment: Brink engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, and mis-
       representation and has violated Standard I(D).



Example 4 (Personal Actions and Integrity):
Carmen Garcia manages a mutual fund dedicated to socially responsible investing.
She is also an environmental activist. As the result of her participation in nonviolent
protests, Garcia has been arrested on numerous occasions for trespassing on the
property of a large petrochemical plant that is accused of damaging the environment.
       Comment: Generally, Standard I(D) is not meant to cover legal transgres-
       sions resulting from acts of civil disobedience in support of personal beliefs
       because such conduct does not reflect poorly on the member’s or candidate’s
       professional reputation, integrity, or competence.



Example 5 (Professional Misconduct):
Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy-side trading desk of an investment management
firm and concentrates on in-house trades for a hedge fund subsidiary managed by a
team at the investment management firm. The hedge fund has been very successful
and is marketed globally by the firm. From her experience as the trader for much of
the activity of the fund, Rasmussen has become quite knowledgeable about the hedge
fund’s strategy, tactics, and performance. When a distinct break in the market occurs
and many of the securities involved in the hedge fund’s strategy decline markedly in

                         value, Rasmussen observes that the reported performance of the hedge fund does not
                         reflect this decline. In her experience, the lack of effect is a very unlikely occurrence.
                         She approaches the head of trading about her concern and is told that she should not
                         ask any questions and that the fund is big and successful and is not her concern. She
                         is fairly sure something is not right, so she contacts the compliance officer, who also
                         tells her to stay away from the issue of the hedge fund’s reporting.
                                Comment: Rasmussen has clearly come across an error in policies, proce-
                                dures, and compliance practices within the firm’s operations. According
                                to the firm’s procedures for reporting potentially unethical activity, she
                                should pursue the issue by gathering some proof of her reason for doubt.
                                Should all internal communications within the firm not satisfy her concerns,
                                Rasmussen should consider reporting the potential unethical activity to
                                the appropriate regulator.

           13            STANDARD I(E) COMPETENCE

                                       demonstrate the application of the Code of Ethics and Standards of
                                       Professional Conduct to situations involving issues of professional
                                       integrity
                                       recommend practices and procedures designed to prevent violations
                                       of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct
                                       identify conduct that conforms to the Code and Standards and
                                       conduct that violates the Code and Standards


                            Members and Candidates must act with and maintain the competence necessary
                            to fulfill their professional responsibilities.



                         Guidance
                         Standard I(E) requires members and candidates to act with and maintain appropriate
                         knowledge, skills, and diligence when they carry out their professional responsibili-
                         ties so that they provide a high standard of professional service for their clients and
                         employers. The Code of Ethics requires members and candidates to “act with integrity,
                         competence, and diligence” and to “maintain and improve their professional com-
                         petence and strive to improve the competence of other investment professionals.”
                         Standard I(E) directly supports these requirements of the Code of Ethics.
                             Given the diverse range of professional services members and candidates engage
                         in, the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to successfully fulfill their roles will
                         vary according to the nature of their professional duties. Determining what conduct
                         specifically constitutes competence will differ for each role and will depend on the
                         facts and circumstances applicable to each member or candidate.
                             While the specific conduct that leads to competence may be different for each
                         member or candidate, the underlying principle of competence is straightforward. To
                         be competent in your role and meet your duties under this standard means having

Standard I(E): Recommended Procedures                                                            91


sufficient knowledge, skills, and abilities suitable for a professional to work in that
specific role with success. These attributes govern the expertise, experience, and
accomplishments that professionals need to perform at the highest level.
   ■   Knowledge is the body of information applied directly to the performance of
       a function and how effectively it is applied.
   ■   Skills are capabilities to perform a role-specific act or function to complete
       specific tasks and achieve professional goals.
   ■   Abilities are capabilities and attitudes that support behaviors that result in
       observable outcomes.
    While competence allows members and candidates the opportunity to undertake
an activity successfully, lack of competence cannot necessarily be determined by an
unsuccessful or a negative outcome. Many competent investment professionals have
experienced failure or loss in their professional lives. For example, a competent invest-
ment manager may not always make profitable investment decisions. A competent
securities analyst may not accurately predict the future prospects of an investment,
despite diligent and thorough analysis.
    Competence is not limited to an examination of the education level of a member
or candidate. A highly educated investment consultant may not have the experience
to undertake consulting activities in an unfamiliar area of practice. An accounting
professional supremely competent in providing financial statement audits may not be
competent in assessing compliance with performance presentation standards, such
as the GIPS standards. Or an investment consultant hired to conduct a search for an
investment manager focused on sustainable investing may not have the skills needed
to competently evaluate managers with that focus.
    Over time, the professional responsibilities of members and candidates may change
or expand, requiring new or different knowledge, skills, and abilities. Members and
candidates will develop and refine their skills and abilities as their careers progress.
Standard I(E) imposes the duty to not simply achieve but also maintain competence,
emphasizing the need for members to continuously maintain or improve the compe-
tence required of their professional position. Although Standard I(E) contemplates
ongoing professional development to maintain proficiency and competence, this stan-
dard does not mandate participation in a particular continuing education program or
professional development plan. Members and candidates can attain and maintain the
competence needed to fulfill their professional responsibilities in a variety of ways.




STANDARD I(E): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
To achieve and maintain competence, members and candidates should consider the
                                                                                            14

   ■   Regularly engaging in a professional development or continuing education
       program
   ■   Studying for or earning professional certifications or designations
   ■   Attending conferences, seminars, or webinars
   ■   Regularly participating in training offered by their employer
   ■   Diligently engaging in informal continuing education or self-study, such
       as through outside reading of subject matter articles, treatises, and
       publications
   ■   Participating in expert groups or organizations

           15            STANDARD I(E): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                         Example 1 (Maintaining Competence):
                         Michelle Lee runs a geopolitical consulting firm where she analyzes international
                         political, social, and economic issues and developments to produce research reports
                         for her clients, many of which are investment management firms. Lee has been closely
                         monitoring news regarding a new multinational trade deal that has the potential to
                         significantly boost commercial activity among countries in a certain region of the
                         world. As soon as the trade deal was officially ratified and announced, she quickly
                         downloaded a copy of the agreement and read it to understand its terms and impact.
                         She also consulted with experts in the field to obtain their opinions on the impacts of
                         the trade deal and confirm her understanding of its terms and implications.
                                 Comment: Lee satisfied the requirement of Standard I(E). Lee was able to
                                 write a knowledgeable and informative research report for her clients by
                                 keeping abreast of developments in her field through news reports, con-
                                 sulting with experts, and studying the trade deal itself to ensure that her
                                 knowledge was up to date.


                         Example 2 (Improving Competence):
                         Chris Choe is the director of research at a large sell-side firm. Several of Choe’s clients
                         have asked her to incorporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings
                         into the research reports the firm produces. Until now, the firm’s research reports
                         have been based only on traditional quantitative metrics. Choe hires an experienced
                         ESG analyst for her team, and she requires all research analysts, including herself,
                         to attend ESG-focused seminars and obtain an ESG investment specialist certificate.
                         In due time, Choe and her team begin to incorporate ESG considerations into their
                         research reports.
                                 Comment: Choe extended her competence in her field by educating herself
                                 on new considerations relevant to her industry and by hiring someone with
                                 ESG expertise to fill a knowledge and skills gap before she and her team
                                 incorporated ESG considerations into the firm’s research reports. As such,
                                 Choe satisfied the requirement of Standard I(E).



                         Example 3 (Change in Role):
                         Gerhardt Glusker is a regulatory attorney for a hedge fund who sought to transition
                         to a sales role after impressing senior management with his strong business acumen.
                         There is a licensing requirement involving an examination that an individual must
                         first pass before being qualified to serve in a sales function. Among other things, the
                         examination covers technical rules and regulations designed to ensure fairness when
                         dealing with clients and prospects. Glusker was not familiar with these rules and

regulations because he was never asked to provide guidance on them as a regulatory
attorney. Glusker did not learn the materials or study for the examination and instead
relied on his industry knowledge to receive a passing score.
       Comment: Glusker failed to satisfy the requirement of Standard I(E).
       He did receive a passing score on a licensing examination, but passing
       the examination, by itself, is not adequate to demonstrate competency.
       Glusker’s failure to learn the applicable rules and regulations relating to
       fairness when dealing with clients and prospects means that he does not
       possess the required knowledge to serve in his new role, despite passing
       the licensing examination.



Example 4 (Supervisory Responsibility):
Linda Evans is one member of a five-person team of analysts at a boutique research
firm providing independent research to buy-side firms. Evans primarily covers the
energy and transportation sectors. Evans’s boss leaves the firm to return to academia.
Firm management promotes Evans to director of research and hires two junior ana-
lysts to replace her. Evans now has supervisory responsibility for four analysts and is
responsible for all research produced by the firm. Prior to her promotion date, Evans
spends a great deal of time and effort getting up to speed on the research projects of
the firm that she was not involved in. Although she has never directly managed others
in the past, Evans does not spend any time becoming familiar with effectively manag-
ing employees, leading teams, or compliance requirements relating to subordinates.
       Comment: Evans’s new position demands competence in other skills, abili-
       ties, and knowledge beyond those needed for her previous position. Evans
       must ensure she extends her competence to cover all responsibilities of her
       new role. She also must now obtain the skills and knowledge needed for
       fulfilling her supervisory responsibility of the other analysts. This could
       include attending conferences or taking professional development courses
       on management, earning compliance credentials, and internal training on
       supervisory responsibility.


Example 5 (Choosing Investments):
Kwame Mifune is a financial planner for over 150 retail investors. Based on the invest-
ment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance of 40 of his clients, he
suggests they purchase life insurance products from Vouchsafe Insurance Company.
Mifune researched Vouchsafe and recommended it because it has a high credit rating,
strong financials, and a decade-long history of providing affordable, safe insurance
products. Within 18 months, as the result of previously unknown financial impropriety
and fraud by the company’s chief financial officer, Vouchsafe goes bankrupt and the
insurance contracts for thousands of policyholders become worthless. Mifune’s clients
claim that he was incompetent in recommending the Vouchsafe policies.
       Comment: Assuming that Mifune’s research of Vouchsafe was thorough and
       appropriate, his failure to uncover the fraudulent practices of the company
       he recommended, which had misled the investment industry as whole, does
       not, by itself, indicate that Mifune is an incompetent financial planner.

                         Alex Halsey is a portfolio manager for a number of high-net-worth individuals. Several
                         of his clients are impressed by the significant gains in a short time frame that they
                         believe can be achieved by investing in cryptocurrency. They urge Halsey to include
                         cryptocurrency products as part of their portfolios. Although Halsey is generally aware
                         of cryptocurrency and has read several articles about the cryptocurrency investment
                         trend in reputable newspapers, Halsey is unfamiliar with the nature of the asset or
                         the difference between the many cryptocurrency products. Not wanting to seem out
                         of touch with current developments in the market, lose clients, or miss out on a hot
                         market trend by delaying an investment decision until he completes research into the
                         asset, Halsey purchases a cryptocurrency product that has been heavily promoted
                         through social media and online advertising for several of his clients.
                                 Comment: Given his limited knowledge, Halsey is not competent to invest
                                 in cryptocurrency for his clients. By hastily investing in cryptocurrency
                                 products without understanding the nature of the investment or the suit-
                                 ability of the investment for his clients, Halsey has violated Standard I(E).

Trading or inducing others to trade on material nonpublic information erodes confi-
dence in capital markets, institutions, and investment professionals by supporting the
idea that those with inside information and special access can take unfair advantage
of the general investing public. Although trading on inside information may lead to
short-term profits, in the long run, individuals and the profession as a whole suffer
from such trading. These actions have caused and will continue to cause investors
to avoid capital markets because the markets are perceived to be “rigged” in favor
of the knowledgeable insider. When the investing public avoids capital markets, the
markets and capital allocation become less efficient and less supportive of strong and
vibrant economies. Standard II(A) promotes and maintains a high level of confidence
in market integrity, which is one of the foundations of the investment profession.
    The prohibition on using this information goes beyond the direct buying and sell-
ing of individual securities or bonds. Members and candidates must not use material
nonpublic information to influence their investment actions related to derivatives
(e.g., swaps or option contracts), mutual funds, or other alternative investments. Any
trading based on material nonpublic information constitutes a violation of Standard
II(A). The expansion of financial products and the increasing interconnectivity of
financial markets globally have resulted in new potential opportunities for trading
on material nonpublic information.

What Is “Material” Information?
Information is “material” if its disclosure would probably have an impact on the price
of a security or if reasonable investors would want to know the information before
making an investment decision. In other words, information is material if it would
significantly alter the total mix of information currently available about a security in
such a way that the price of the security would be affected.
    The specificity of the information, the extent of its difference from public informa-
tion, its nature, and its reliability are key factors in determining whether a particular
piece of information fits the definition of material. For example, material information
may include, but is not limited to, information on the following:
   ■   earnings;
   ■   mergers, acquisitions, tender offers, or joint ventures;
   ■   changes in assets or asset quality;
   ■   innovative products, processes, or discoveries (e.g., new product trials or
       research efforts);
   ■   new licenses, patents, registered trademarks, or regulatory approval/rejec-
       tion of a product;
   ■   developments regarding customers or suppliers (e.g., the acquisition or loss
       of a contract);
   ■   changes in management;
   ■   change in auditor notification or the fact that the issuer may no longer rely
       on an auditor’s report or qualified opinion;
   ■   events regarding the issuer’s securities (e.g., defaults on senior securities,
       calls of securities for redemption, repurchase plans, stock splits, changes in
       dividends, changes to the rights of security holders, and public or private
       sales of additional securities);
   ■   bankruptcies;
   ■   significant legal disputes;
   ■   government reports of economic trends (employment, housing starts, cur-
       rency information, etc.);
   ■   orders for large trades before they are executed; and

                             ■   new or changing equity or debt ratings issued by a third party (e.g., sell-side
                                 recommendations and credit ratings).
                             In addition to the substance and specificity of the information, the source or
                         relative reliability of the information also determines materiality. The less reliable a
                         source, the less likely the information provided would be considered material. For
                         example, factual information from a corporate insider regarding a significant new
                         contract for a company is likely to be material, whereas an assumption based on
                         speculation by a competitor about the same contract is likely to be less reliable and,
                         therefore, not material. Additionally, information about trials of a new drug, product,
                         or service under development from qualified personnel involved in the trials is likely
                         to be material, whereas educated conjecture by subject experts not connected to the
                         trials is unlikely to be material.
                             Also, the more ambiguous the effect of the information on price, the less material
                         that information is considered. If it is unclear whether and to what extent the informa-
                         tion will affect the price of a security, the information may not be considered material.
                         The passage of time may also render information that was once important immaterial.

                         What Constitutes “Nonpublic” Information?
                         Information is “nonpublic” until it has been disseminated or is available to the mar-
                         ketplace in general (as opposed to a select group of investors). “Disseminated” can be
                         defined as “made known.” For example, a company report of profits that is posted on
                         the internet and distributed widely through a press release or accompanied by a filing
                         has been effectively disseminated to the marketplace. Members and candidates must
                         have a reasonable expectation that people have received the information before it can
                         be considered public. It is not necessary, however, to wait for the slowest method of
                         delivery. Once the information is disseminated to the market, it is public information
                         that is no longer covered by this standard.
                             Members and candidates must be particularly aware of information that is selec-
                         tively disclosed by corporations to a small group of investors, analysts, or other market
                         participants. Information that is made available to analysts remains nonpublic until it
                         is made available to investors in general. Corporations that disclose information on
                         a limited basis create the potential for insider-trading violations.
                             Issues of selective disclosure often arise when a corporate insider provides mate-
                         rial information to analysts in a briefing or conference call before that information is
                         released to the public. Analysts must be aware that a disclosure made to a room full of
                         analysts does not necessarily make the disclosed information “public.” Analysts should
                         also be alert to the possibility that they are selectively receiving material nonpublic
                         information when a company provides them with guidance or interpretation of such
                         publicly available information as financial statements or regulatory filings.
                             A member or candidate may use insider information provided legitimately by
                         the source company for the specific purpose of conducting due diligence according
                         to the business agreement between the parties for such activities as mergers, loan
                         underwriting, credit ratings, and offering engagements. In such instances, the invest-
                         ment professional would not be considered in violation of Standard II(A) by using
                         the material information. However, the use of insider information provided by the
                         source company for other purposes, especially to trade or entice others to trade the
                         securities of the firm, conflicts with this standard.

                         Mosaic Theory
                         A financial analyst gathers and interprets large quantities of information from many
                         sources. The analyst may use significant conclusions derived from the analysis of public
                         and nonmaterial nonpublic information as the basis for investment recommendations
                         and decisions even if those conclusions would have been material inside information

had they been communicated directly to the analyst by a company. Under the “mosaic
theory,” financial analysts are free to act on this collection, or mosaic, of information
without risking violation.
    The practice of financial analysis depends on the free flow of information. For
the fair and efficient operation of the capital markets, analysts and investors must
have the greatest amount of information possible to facilitate making well-informed
investment decisions about how and where to invest capital. Accurate, timely, and
intelligible communication is essential if analysts and investors are to obtain the data
needed to make informed decisions about how and where to invest capital. These
disclosures must go beyond the information mandated by the reporting requirements
of the securities laws and should include specific business information about items
used to guide a company’s future growth, such as new products, capital projects, and
the competitive environment. Analysts seek and use such information to compare and
contrast investment alternatives.
    Much of the information used by analysts comes directly from companies. Analysts
often receive such information through contacts with corporate insiders, especially
investor-relations staff and financial officers. Information may be disseminated in the
form of press releases, through oral presentations by company executives in analysts’
meetings or conference calls, or during analysts’ visits to company premises. In seeking
to develop the most accurate and complete picture of a company, analysts should also
reach beyond contacts with companies themselves and collect information from other
sources, such as customers, contractors, suppliers, and the companies’ competitors.
    Analysts are in the business of formulating opinions and insights that are not
obvious to the general investing public about the attractiveness of particular securi-
ties. In the course of their work, analysts actively seek out corporate information not
generally known to the market for the express purpose of analyzing that informa-
tion, forming an opinion on its significance, and informing their clients, who can be
expected to trade on the basis of the recommendation. Analysts’ initiatives to discover
and analyze information and communicate their findings to their clients significantly
enhance market efficiency, thus benefiting all investors (see Dirks v. Securities and
Exchange Commission). Accordingly, violations of Standard II(A) will not result when
a perceptive analyst reaches a conclusion about a corporate action or event through
an analysis of public information and items of nonmaterial nonpublic information.
    Investment professionals should note, however, that although analysts are free to use
mosaic information in their research reports, they should save and document all their
research [see Standard V(C) Record Retention]. Evidence of the analyst’s knowledge
of public and nonmaterial nonpublic information about a corporation strengthens the
assertion that the analyst reached his or her conclusions solely through appropriate
methods rather than through the use of material nonpublic information.

Social Media
The continuing advancement in technology allows members, candidates, and the
industry at large to exchange information at rates not previously available. It is import-
ant for investment professionals to understand the implications of using information
from the internet and social media platforms because all such information may not
actually be considered public.
    Some social media platforms require membership in specific groups in order to
access the published content. Members and candidates participating in groups with
membership limitations should verify that material information obtained from these
sources can also be accessed from a source that would be considered available to the
public (e.g., company filings, webpages, and press releases).
    Members and candidates may use social media platforms to communicate with
clients or investors without conflicting with this standard. As long as the information
reaches all clients or is open to the investing public, the use of these platforms would

                         be comparable with other traditional forms of communications, such as e-mails and
                         press releases. Members and candidates, as required by Standard I(A), should also
                         complete all appropriate regulatory filings related to information distributed through
                         social media platforms.

                         Using Industry Experts
                         The increased demand for insights for understanding the complexities of some
                         industries has led to an expansion of engagement with outside experts. As the level
                         of engagement increased, new businesses formed to connect analysts and investors
                         with individuals who have specialized knowledge of their industry (e.g., technology or
                         pharmaceuticals). These networks offer investors the opportunity to reach beyond their
                         usual business circles to speak with experts regarding economic conditions, industry
                         trends, and technical issues relating to specific products and services.
                             Members and candidates may provide compensation to individuals for their insights
                         without violating this standard. However, members and candidates are ultimately
                         responsible for ensuring that they are not requesting or acting on confidential infor-
                         mation received from external experts, which is in violation of security regulations
                         and laws or duties to others. As the recent string of insider-trading cases displayed,
                         some experts are willing to provide confidential and protected information for the
                         right incentive.
                             Firms connecting experts with members or candidates often require both parties
                         to sign agreements concerning the disclosure of material nonpublic information. Even
                         with the protections from such compliance practices, if an expert provides material
                         nonpublic information, members and candidates would be prohibited from taking
                         investment actions on the associated firm until the information became publicly
                         known to the market.

                         Investment Research Reports
                         When a particularly well-known or respected analyst issues a report or makes changes
                         to his or her recommendation, that information alone may have an effect on the market
                         and thus may be considered material. Theoretically, under Standard II(A), such a report
                         would have to be made public at the time it was distributed to clients. The analyst
                         is not a company insider, however, and does not have access to inside information.
                         Presumably, the analyst created the report from information available to the public
                         (mosaic theory) and by using his or her expertise to interpret the information. The
                         analyst’s hard work, paid for by the client, generated the conclusions.
                             Simply because the public in general would find the conclusions material does not
                         require that the analyst make his or her work public. Investors who are not clients
                         of the analyst can either do the work themselves or become clients of the analyst to
                         gain access to the analyst’s expertise.

                         Achieve Public Dissemination
                         If a member or candidate determines that information is material, the member or
                         candidate should make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the
                         information. These efforts usually entail encouraging the issuing company to make the
                         information public. If public dissemination is not possible, the member or candidate
                         must communicate the information only to the designated supervisory and compliance

personnel within the member’s or candidate’s firm and must not take investment
action or alter current investment recommendations on the basis of the information.
Moreover, members and candidates must not knowingly engage in any conduct that
may induce company insiders to privately disclose material nonpublic information.


Adopt Compliance Procedures
Members and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt compliance procedures
to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information. Particularly important is
improving compliance in such areas as the review of employee and proprietary trad-
ing, the review of investment recommendations, documentation of firm procedures,
and the supervision of interdepartmental communications in multiservice firms.
Compliance procedures should suit the particular characteristics of a firm, including
its size and the nature of its business.
     Members and candidates are encouraged to inform their supervisor and compliance
personnel of suspected inappropriate use of material nonpublic information as the
basis for security trading activities or recommendations being made within their firm.


Adopt Disclosure Procedures
Members and candidates should encourage their firms to develop and follow disclo-
sure policies designed to ensure that information is disseminated to the marketplace
in an equitable manner. For example, analysts from small firms should receive the
same information and attention from a company as analysts from large firms receive.
Similarly, companies should not provide certain information to buy-side analysts but
not to sell-side analysts, or vice versa. Furthermore, a company should not discriminate
among analysts in the provision of information or “blackball” particular analysts who
have given negative reports on the company in the past.
    Within investment and research firms, members and candidates should encourage
the development of and compliance with procedures for distributing new and updated
investment opinions to clients. Recommendations of this nature may represent mate-
rial market-moving information that needs to be communicated to all clients fairly.

Companies should consider issuing press releases prior to analyst meetings and
conference calls and scripting those meetings and calls to decrease the chance that
further information will be disclosed. If material nonpublic information is disclosed
for the first time in an analyst meeting or call, the company should promptly issue a
press release or otherwise make the information publicly available.


Firewall Elements
An information barrier commonly referred to as a “firewall” is the most widely used
approach for preventing the communication of material nonpublic information within
firms. It restricts the flow of confidential information to those who need to know the
information to perform their jobs effectively. The minimum elements of such a system
include, but are not limited to, the following:
   ■   substantial control of relevant interdepartmental communications, prefer-
       ably through a clearance area within the firm in either the compliance or
       legal department;
   ■   review of employee trading through the maintenance of “watch,” “restricted,”
       and “rumor” lists;

                              ■   documentation of the procedures designed to limit the flow of information
                                  between departments and of the actions taken to enforce those procedures;
                                  and
                              ■   heightened review or restriction of proprietary trading while a firm is in
                                  possession of material nonpublic information.



                          Appropriate Interdepartmental Communications
                          Although documentation requirements must, for practical reasons, take into account
                          the differences between the activities of small firms and those of large, multiservice
                          firms, firms of all sizes and types benefit by improving the documentation of their
                          internal enforcement of firewall procedures. Therefore, even at small firms, procedures
                          concerning interdepartmental communication, the review of trading activity, and the
                          investigation of possible violations should be compiled and formalized.

                          Physical Separation of Departments
                          As a practical matter, to the greatest extent possible, firms should consider the phys-
                          ical separation of departments and files to prevent the communication of sensitive
                          information that should not be shared. For example, the investment banking and
                          corporate finance areas of a brokerage firm should be separated from the sales and
                          research departments, and a bank’s commercial lending department should be seg-
                          regated from its trust and research departments.

                          Prevention of Personnel Overlap
                          There should be no overlap of personnel between the investment banking and corporate
                          finance areas of a brokerage firm and the sales and research departments or between
                          a bank’s commercial lending department and its trust and research departments. For
                          a firewall to be effective in a multiservice firm, an employee should be on only one
                          side of the firewall at any time. Inside knowledge may not be limited to information
                          about a specific offering or the current financial condition of a company. Analysts
                          may be exposed to much information about the company, including new product
                          developments or future budget projections that clearly constitute inside knowledge
                          and thus preclude the analyst from returning to his or her research function. For
                          example, an analyst who follows a particular company may provide limited assistance
                          to the investment bankers under carefully controlled circumstances when the firm’s
                          investment banking department is involved in a deal with the company. That analyst
                          must then be treated as though he or she were an investment banker; the analyst must
                          remain on the investment banking side of the wall until any information he or she
                          learns is publicly disclosed. In short, the analyst cannot use any information learned
                          in the course of the project for research purposes and cannot share that information
                          with colleagues in the research department.

                          A Reporting System
                          A primary objective of an effective firewall procedure is to establish a reporting
                          system in which authorized people review and approve communications between
                          departments. If an employee behind a firewall believes that he or she needs to share
                          confidential information with someone on the other side of the wall, the employee
                          should consult a designated compliance officer to determine whether sharing the
                          information is necessary and how much information should be shared. If the sharing
                          is necessary, the compliance officer should coordinate the process of “looking over
                          the wall” so that the necessary information will be shared and the integrity of the
                          procedure will be maintained.

Standard II(A): Recommended Procedures                                                      101


    A single supervisor or compliance officer should have the specific authority and
responsibility of deciding whether information is material and whether it is sufficiently
public to be used as the basis for investment decisions. Ideally, the supervisor or
compliance officer responsible for communicating information to a firm’s research
or brokerage area would not be a member of that area.


Personal Trading Limitations
Firms should consider restrictions or prohibitions on personal trading by employ-
ees and should carefully monitor both proprietary trading and personal trading by
employees. Firms should require employees to make periodic reports (to the extent
that such reporting is not already required by securities laws) of their own transactions
and transactions made for the benefit of family members. Securities should be placed
on a restricted list when a firm has or may have material nonpublic information. The
broad distribution of a restricted list often triggers the sort of trading the list was
developed to avoid. Therefore, a watch list shown to only the few people responsible
for compliance should be used to monitor transactions in specified securities. The use
of a watch list in combination with a restricted list is an increasingly common means
of ensuring effective control of personal trading.


Record Maintenance
Multiservice firms should maintain written records of the communications between
various departments. Firms should place a high priority on training and should
consider instituting comprehensive training programs, particularly for employees in
sensitive areas.


Proprietary Trading Procedures
Procedures concerning the restriction or review of a firm’s proprietary trading
while the firm possesses material nonpublic information will necessarily depend
on the types of proprietary trading in which the firm may engage. A prohibition
on all types of proprietary activity when a firm comes into possession of material
nonpublic information is not appropriate. For example, when a firm acts as a market
maker, a prohibition on proprietary trading may be counterproductive to the goals
of maintaining the confidentiality of information and market liquidity. This concern
is particularly important in the relationships between small, regional broker/dealers
and small issuers. In many situations, a firm will take a small issuer public with the
understanding that the firm will continue to be a market maker in the stock. In such
instances, a withdrawal by the firm from market-making activities would be a clear
tip to outsiders. Firms that continue market-making activity while in the possession
of material nonpublic information should, however, instruct their market makers to
remain passive with respect to the market—that is, to take only the contra side of
unsolicited customer trades.
    In risk-arbitrage trading, the case for a trading prohibition is more compelling
than it is in the case of market making. The impetus for arbitrage trading is neither
passive nor reactive, and the potential for illegal profits is greater than in market
making. The most prudent course for firms is to suspend arbitrage activity when a
security is placed on the watch list. Those firms that continue arbitrage activity face
a high hurdle in proving the adequacy of their internal procedures for preventing
trading on material nonpublic information and must demonstrate a stringent review
and documentation of firm trades.

                          Communication to All Employees
                          Members and candidates should encourage their employers to circulate written com-
                          pliance policies and guidelines to all employees. Policies and guidelines should be
                          used in conjunction with training programs aimed at enabling employees to recognize
                          material nonpublic information. Such information is not always clearly identifiable.
                              Employees must be given sufficient training to either make an informed decision
                          or to realize they need to consult a supervisor or compliance officer before engag-
                          ing in questionable transactions. Appropriate policies reinforce that using material
                          nonpublic information is illegal in many countries. Such trading activities based on
                          material nonpublic information undermine the integrity of the individual, the firm,
                          and the capital markets.




            18            STANDARD II(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                          Example 1 (Acting on Nonpublic Information):
                          Frank Barnes, the president and controlling shareholder of the SmartTown clothing
                          chain, decides to accept a tender offer and sell the family business at a price almost dou-
                          ble the market price of its shares. He describes this decision to his sister (SmartTown’s
                          treasurer), who conveys it to her daughter (who owns no stock in the family company
                          at present), who tells her husband, Staple. Staple, however, tells his stockbroker, Alex
                          Halsey, who immediately buys SmartTown stock for himself.
                                 Comment: The information regarding the pending sale is both material and
                                 nonpublic. Staple has violated Standard II(A) by communicating the inside
                                 information to his broker. Halsey also has violated the standard by buying
                                 the shares on the basis of material nonpublic information.



                          Example 2 (Controlling Nonpublic Information):
                          Samuel Peter, an analyst with Scotland and Pierce Incorporated, is assisting his firm
                          with a secondary offering for Bright Ideas Lamp Company. Peter participates, via
                          telephone conference call, in a meeting with Scotland and Pierce investment bank-
                          ing employees and Bright Ideas’ CEO. Peter is advised that the company’s earnings
                          projections for the next year have significantly dropped. Throughout the telephone
                          conference call, several Scotland and Pierce salespeople and portfolio managers walk
                          in and out of Peter’s office, where the telephone call is taking place. As a result, they
                          are aware of the drop in projected earnings for Bright Ideas. Before the conference call
                          is concluded, the salespeople trade the stock of the company on behalf of the firm’s
                          clients and other firm personnel trade the stock in a firm proprietary account and in
                          employees’ personal accounts.
                                 Comment: Peter has violated Standard II(A) because he failed to prevent
                                 the transfer and misuse of material nonpublic information to others in his
                                 firm. Peter’s firm should have adopted information barriers to prevent the
                                 communication of nonpublic information between departments of the firm.
                                 The salespeople and portfolio managers who traded on the information have
                                 also violated Standard II(A) by trading on inside information.

Standard II(A): Application of the Standard                                                  103



Example 3 (Selective Disclosure of Material Information):
Elizabeth Levenson is based in Hanoi and covers the Vietnamese market for her firm,
which is based in Singapore. She is invited, together with the other 10 largest share-
holders of a manufacturing company, to meet the finance director of that company.
During the meeting, the finance director states that the company expects its workforce
to strike next Friday, which will cripple productivity and distribution. Can Levenson use
this information as a basis to change her rating on the company from “buy” to “sell”?
       Comment: Levenson must first determine whether the material information
       is public. According to Standard II(A), if the company has not made this
       information public (a small group forum does not qualify as a method of
       public dissemination), she cannot use the information.



Example 4 (Determining Materiality):
Leah Fechtman is trying to decide whether to hold or sell shares of an oil-and-gas
exploration company that she owns in several of the funds she manages. Although
the company has underperformed the index for some time already, the trends in the
industry sector signal that companies of this type might become takeover targets.
While she is considering her decision, her doctor, who casually follows the markets,
mentions that she thinks that the company in question will soon be bought out by a
large multinational conglomerate and that it would be a good idea to buy the stock
right now. After talking to various investment professionals and checking their opin-
ions on the company as well as checking industry trends, Fechtman decides the next
day to accumulate more stock in the oil-and-gas exploration company.
       Comment: Although information on an expected takeover bid may be of
       the type that is generally material and nonpublic, in this case, the source of
       information is unreliable, so the information cannot be considered material.
       Therefore, Fechtman is not prohibited from trading the stock on the basis
       of this information.



Example 5 (Applying the Mosaic Theory):
Jagdish Teja is a buy-side analyst covering the furniture industry. Looking for an attrac-
tive company to recommend as a buy, he analyzes several furniture makers by studying
their financial reports and visiting their operations. He also talks to some designers
and retailers to find out which furniture styles are trendy and popular. Although none
of the companies that he analyzes are a clear buy, he discovers that one of them, Swan
Furniture Company (SFC), may be in financial trouble. SFC’s extravagant new designs
have been introduced at substantial cost. Even though these designs initially attracted
attention, the public is now buying more conservative furniture from other makers.
Based on this information and on a profit-and-loss analysis, Teja believes that SFC’s
next-quarter earnings will drop substantially. He issues a sell recommendation for
SFC. Immediately after receiving that recommendation, investment managers start
reducing the SFC stock in their portfolios.
       Comment: Information on quarterly earnings data is material and nonpub-
       lic. Teja arrived at his conclusion about the earnings drop on the basis of
       public information and pieces of nonmaterial nonpublic information (such
       as opinions of designers and retailers). Therefore, trading based on Teja’s
       correct conclusion is not prohibited by Standard II(A).

                          Example 6 (Applying the Mosaic Theory):
                          Roger Clement is a senior financial analyst who specializes in the European automobile
                          sector at Rivoli Capital. Because he has been repeatedly nominated by many leading
                          industry magazines and newsletters as a “best analyst” for the automobile industry, he
                          is widely regarded as an authority on the sector. After speaking with representatives
                          of Turgot Chariots—a European auto manufacturer with sales primarily in South
                          Korea—and after conducting interviews with salespeople, labor leaders, his firm’s South
                          Korean currency analysts, and banking officials, Clement analyzed Turgot Chariots
                          and concluded that (1) its newly introduced model will probably not meet sales
                          expectations, (2) its corporate restructuring strategy may well face serious opposition
                          from unions, (3) the depreciation of the South Korean won should lead to pressure
                          on margins for the industry in general and Turgot’s market segment in particular,
                          and (4) banks could take a tougher-than-expected stance in the upcoming round of
                          credit renegotiations with the company. For these reasons, he changes his conclusion
                          about the company from “market outperform” to “market underperform.” Clement
                          retains the support material used to reach his conclusion in case questions later arise.
                                 Comment: To reach a conclusion about the value of the company, Clement
                                 has pieced together a number of nonmaterial or public bits of information
                                 that affect Turgot Chariots. Therefore, under the mosaic theory, Clement
                                 has not violated Standard II(A) in drafting the report.



                          Example 7 (Analyst Recommendations as Material Nonpublic
                          Information):
                          The next day, Clement is preparing to be interviewed on a global financial news
                          television program where he will discuss his changed recommendation on Turgot
                          Chariots for the first time in public. While preparing for the program, he mentions
                          to the show’s producers and Mary Zito, the journalist who will be interviewing him,
                          the information he will be discussing. Just prior to going on the air, Zito sells her
                          holdings in Turgot Chariots. She also phones her father with the information because
                          she knows that he and other family members have investments in Turgot Chariots.
                                 Comment: When Zito receives advance notice of Clement’s change of opin-
                                 ion, she knows it will have a material impact on the stock price, even if she
                                 is not totally aware of Clement’s underlying reasoning. She is not a client
                                 of Clement but obtains early access to the material nonpublic information
                                 prior to publication. Her trades are thus based on material nonpublic
                                 information and violate Standard II(A).
                                     Zito further violates the Standard by relaying the information to her
                                 father. It would not matter if he or any other family member traded; the
                                 act of providing the information violates Standard II(A). The fact that the
                                 information is provided to a family member does not absolve someone of
                                 the prohibition of using or communicating material nonpublic information.



                          Example 8 (Acting on Nonpublic Information):
                          Ashton Kellogg is a retired investment professional who manages his own portfolio.
                          He owns shares in National Savings, a large local bank. A close friend and golfing
                          buddy, John Mayfield, is a senior executive at National. National has seen its stock
                          price drop considerably, and the news and outlook are not good. In a conversation
                          about the economy and the banking industry on the golf course, Mayfield relays the
                          information that National will surprise the investment community in a few days when

it announces excellent earnings for the quarter. Kellogg is pleasantly surprised by this
information, and thinking that Mayfield, as a senior executive, knows the law and would
not disclose inside information, he doubles his position in the bank. Subsequently,
National announces that it had good operating earnings but had to set aside reserves
for anticipated significant losses on its loan portfolio. The combined news causes the
stock to go down 60%.
       Comment: Even though Kellogg believes that Mayfield would not break the
       law by disclosing inside information and money was lost on the purchase,
       Kellogg should not have purchased additional shares of National. It is the
       member’s or candidate’s responsibility to make sure, before executing
       investment actions, that comments about earnings are not material non-
       public information. Kellogg has violated Standard II(A).



Example 9 (Mosaic Theory):
John Doll is a research analyst for a hedge fund that also sells its research to a select
group of paying-client investment firms. Doll’s focus is medical technology companies
and products, and he has been in the business long enough and has been successful
enough to build up a very credible network of friends and experts in the business. Doll
has been working on a major research report recommending Boyce Health, a medical
device manufacturer. He recently ran into an old acquaintance at a wedding who is
a senior executive at Boyce, and Doll asked about the business. Doll was drawn to a
statement that the executive, who has responsibilities in the new products area, made
about a product: “I would not get too excited about the medium-term prospects; we
have a lot of work to do first.” Doll incorporated this and other information about the
new Boyce product in his long-term recommendation of Boyce.
       Comment: Doll’s conversation with the senior executive is part of the mosaic
       of information used in recommending Boyce. When holding discussions
       with a firm executive, Doll would need to guard against soliciting or obtain-
       ing material nonpublic information. Before issuing the report, the executive’s
       statement about the continuing development of the product would need
       to be weighed against the other known public facts to determine whether
       it would be considered material.


Example 10 (Materiality Determination):
Larry Nadler, a trader for a mutual fund, gets a text message from another firm’s trader,
whom he has known for years. The message indicates a software company is going
to report strong earnings when the firm publicly announces in two days. Nadler has
a buy order from a portfolio manager within his firm to purchase several hundred
thousand shares of the stock. Nadler is aggressive in placing the portfolio manager’s
order and completes the purchases by the following morning, a day ahead of the firm’s
planned earnings announcement.
       Comment: There are often rumors and whisper numbers before a release
       of any kind. The text message from the other trader would most likely be
       considered market noise. Unless Nadler knew that the trader had an ongoing
       business relationship with the public firm, he had no reason to suspect he
       was receiving material nonpublic information that would prevent him from
       completing the trading request of the portfolio manager.

                          treatment. This information is critical to Mary making informed recommendations
                          of the companies producing these drugs.
                                 Comment: McCoy is appropriately using the expert networks to enhance
                                 her evaluation process. She has neither asked for nor received information
                                 that may be considered material and nonpublic, such as preliminary trial
                                 results. McCoy is allowed to seek advice from professionals within the
                                 industry that she follows.

                          Tom Watson is a research analyst working for a hedge fund. To stay informed,
                          Watson relies on outside experts for information on such industries as technology
                          and pharmaceuticals, where new advancements occur frequently. The meetings with
                          the industry experts often are arranged through networks or placement agents that
                          have specific policies and procedures in place to deter the exchange of material non-
                          public information.
                              Watson arranges a call to discuss future prospects for one of the fund’s existing
                          technology company holdings, a company that was testing a new semiconductor
                          product. The scientist leading the tests indicates his disappointment with the per-
                          formance of the new semiconductor. Following the call, Watson relays the insights
                          he received to others at the fund. The fund sells its current position in the company
                          and buys many put options because the market is anticipating the success of the new
                          semiconductor and the share price reflects the market’s optimism.
                                 Comment: Watson has violated Standard II(A) by passing along material
                                 nonpublic information concerning the ongoing product tests, which the fund
                                 used to trade in the securities and options of the related company. Watson
                                 cannot simply rely on the agreements signed by individuals who participate
                                 in expert networks that state that he has not received information that
                                 would prohibit his trading activity. He must make his own determination
                                 whether information he received through these arrangements reaches a
                                 materiality threshold that would affect his trading abilities.

Guidance

Highlights:

    ■   Information-Based Manipulation
    ■   Transaction-Based Manipulation
Standard II(B) requires that members and candidates uphold market integrity by
prohibiting market manipulation. Market manipulation includes practices that distort
security prices or trading volume with the intent to deceive people or entities that
rely on information in the market. Market manipulation damages the interests of all
investors by disrupting the smooth functioning of financial markets and lowering
investor confidence.
    Market manipulation may lead to a lack of trust in the fairness of the capital
markets, resulting in higher risk premiums and reduced investor participation. A
reduction in the efficiency of a local capital market may negatively affect the growth
and economic health of the country and may also influence the operations of the
globally interconnected capital markets. Although market manipulation may be less
likely to occur in mature financial markets than in emerging markets, cross-border
investing increasingly exposes all global investors to the potential for such practices.
    Market manipulation includes (1) the dissemination of false or misleading informa-
tion and (2) transactions that deceive or would be likely to mislead market participants
by distorting the price-setting mechanism of financial instruments. The development
of new products and technologies increases the incentives, means, and opportunities
for market manipulation. Additionally, the increasing complexity and sophistication
of the technologies used for communicating with market participants have created
new avenues for manipulation.

Information-Based Manipulation
Information-based manipulation includes, but is not limited to, spreading false rumors
to induce trading by others. For example, members and candidates must refrain from
“pumping up” the price of an investment by issuing misleading positive information
or overly optimistic projections of a security’s worth only to later “dump” the invest-
ment (i.e., sell it) once the price, fueled by the misleading information’s effect on other
market participants, reaches an artificially high level.

Transaction-Based Manipulation
Transaction-based manipulation involves instances where a member or candidate knew
or should have known that his or her actions could affect the pricing of a security.
This type of manipulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:
    ■   transactions that artificially affect prices or volume to give the impression
        of activity or price movement in a financial instrument, which represent a
        diversion from the expectations of a fair and efficient market, and
    ■   securing a controlling, dominant position in a financial instrument to
        exploit and manipulate the price of a related derivative and/or the underly-
        ing asset.

                              Standard II(B) is not intended to preclude transactions undertaken on legitimate
                          trading strategies based on perceived market inefficiencies. The intent of the action
                          is critical to determining whether it is a violation of this standard.




            20            STANDARD II(B): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                          Example 1 (Independent Analysis and Company Promotion):
                          The principal owner of Financial Information Services (FIS) entered into an agreement
                          with two microcap companies to promote the companies’ stock in exchange for stock
                          and cash compensation. The principal owner caused FIS to disseminate e-mails, design
                          and maintain several websites, and distribute an online investment newsletter—all of
                          which recommended investment in the two companies. The systematic publication of
                          purportedly independent analyses and recommendations containing inaccurate and
                          highly promotional and speculative statements increased public investment in the
                          companies and led to dramatically higher stock prices.
                                 Comment: The principal owner of FIS violated Standard II(B) by using
                                 inaccurate reporting and misleading information under the guise of inde-
                                 pendent analysis to artificially increase the stock price of the companies.
                                 Furthermore, the principal owner violated Standard V(A) Diligence and
                                 Reasonable Basis by not having a reasonable and adequate basis for rec-
                                 ommending the two companies and violated Standard VI(A) Disclosure
                                 of Conflicts by not disclosing to investors the compensation agreements
                                 (which constituted a conflict of interest).



                          Example 2 (Personal Trading Practices and Price):
                          John Gray is a private investor in Belgium who bought a large position several years ago
                          in Fame Pharmaceuticals, a German small-cap security with limited average trading
                          volume. He has now decided to significantly reduce his holdings owing to the poor
                          price performance. Gray is worried that the low trading volume for the stock may
                          cause the price to decline further as he attempts to sell his large position.
                              Gray devises a plan to divide his holdings into multiple accounts in different bro-
                          kerage firms and private banks in the names of family members, friends, and even a
                          private religious institution. He then creates a rumor campaign on various blogs and
                          social media outlets promoting the company.
                              Gray begins to buy and sell the stock using the accounts in hopes of raising the
                          trading volume and the price. He conducts the trades through multiple brokers,
                          selling slightly larger positions than he bought on a tactical schedule, and over time,
                          he is able to reduce his holding as desired without negatively affecting the sale price.
                                 Comment: John violated Standard II(B) by fraudulently creating the appear-
                                 ance that there was a greater investor interest in the stock through the
                                 online rumors. Additionally, through his trading strategy, he created the
                                 appearance that there was greater liquidity in the stock than actually
                                 existed. He was able to manipulate the price through both misinformation
                                 and trading practices.

Standard II(B): Application of the Standard                                                   109



Example 3 (Creating Artificial Price Volatility):
Matthew Murphy is an analyst at Divisadero Securities & Co., which has a significant
number of hedge funds among its most important brokerage clients. Some of the hedge
funds hold short positions on Wirewolf Semiconductor. Two trading days before the
publication of a quarter-end report, Murphy alerts his sales force that he is about to
issue a research report on Wirewolf that will include the following opinions:
    ■   quarterly revenues are likely to fall short of management’s guidance,
    ■   earnings will be as much as 5 cents per share (or more than 10%) below
        consensus, and
    ■   Wirewolf ’s highly respected chief financial officer may be about to join
        another company.
    Knowing that Wirewolf has already entered its declared quarter-end “quiet period”
before reporting earnings (and thus would be reluctant to respond to rumors),
Murphy times the release of his research report specifically to sensationalize the
negative aspects of the message in order to create significant downward pressure on
Wirewolf ’s stock—to the distinct advantage of Divisadero’s hedge fund clients. The
report’s conclusions are based on speculation, not on fact. The next day, the research
report is broadcast to all of Divisadero’s clients and to the usual newswire services.
    Before Wirewolf ’s investor-relations department can assess the damage on the final
trading day of the quarter and refute Murphy’s report, its stock opens trading sharply
lower, allowing Divisadero’s clients to cover their short positions at substantial gains.
        Comment: Murphy violated Standard II(B) by aiming to create artificial price
        volatility designed to have a material impact on the price of an issuer’s stock.
        Moreover, by lacking an adequate basis for the recommendation, Murphy
        also violated Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis.



Example 4 (Personal Trading and Volume):
Rajesh Sekar manages two funds—an equity fund and a balanced fund—whose
equity components are supposed to be managed in accordance with the same model.
According to that model, the funds’ holdings in stock of Digital Design Inc. (DD) are
excessive. Reduction of the DD holdings would not be easy, however, because the stock
has low liquidity in the stock market. Sekar decides to start trading larger portions of
DD stock back and forth between his two funds to slowly increase the price; he believes
market participants will see growing volume and increasing price and become inter-
ested in the stock. If other investors are willing to buy the DD stock because of such
interest, then Sekar will be able to get rid of at least some of his overweight position
without inducing price decreases. In this way, the whole transaction will be for the
benefit of fund participants, even if additional brokers’ commissions are incurred.
        Comment: Sekar’s plan would be beneficial for his funds’ participants but
        is based on artificial distortion of both trading volume and the price of the
        DD stock and thus constitutes a violation of Standard II(B).



Example 5 (“Pump-Priming” Strategy):
ACME Futures Exchange is launching a new bond futures contract. To convince
investors, traders, arbitrageurs, hedgers, and so on, to use its contract, the exchange

                          with members in which they commit to a substantial minimum trading volume on
                          the new contract over a specific period in exchange for substantial reductions of their
                          regular commissions.
                                  Comment: The formal liquidity of a market is determined by the obligations
                                  set on market makers, but the actual liquidity of a market is better estimated
                                  by the actual trading volume and bid–ask spreads. Attempts to mislead
                                  participants about the actual liquidity of the market constitute a violation
                                  of Standard II(B). In this example, investors have been intentionally misled
                                  to believe they chose the most liquid instrument for some specific purpose,
                                  but they could eventually see the actual liquidity of the contract significantly
                                  reduced after the term of the agreement expires. If the ACME Futures
                                  Exchange fully discloses its agreement with members to boost transactions
                                  over some initial launch period, it will not violate Standard II(B). ACME’s
                                  intent is not to harm investors but, on the contrary, to give them a better
                                  service. For that purpose, it may engage in a liquidity-pumping strategy,
                                  but the strategy must be disclosed.


                          Example 6 (Creating Artificial Price Volatility):
                          Emily Gordon, an analyst of household products companies, is employed by a research
                          boutique, Picador & Co. Based on information that she has gathered during a trip
                          through Latin America, she believes that Hygene, Inc., a major marketer of personal
                          care products, has generated better-than-expected sales from its new product initia-
                          tives in South America. After modestly boosting her projections for revenue and for
                          gross profit margin in her worksheet models for Hygene, Gordon estimates that her
                          earnings projection of US$2.00 per diluted share for the current year may be as much
                          as 5% too low. She contacts the chief financial officer (CFO) of Hygene to try to gain
                          confirmation of her findings from her trip and to get some feedback regarding her
                          revised models. The CFO declines to comment and reiterates management’s most
                          recent guidance of US$1.95–US$2.05 for the year.
                              Gordon decides to try to force a comment from the company by telling Picador
                          & Co. clients who follow a momentum investment style that consensus earnings
                          projections for Hygene are much too low; she explains that she is considering raising
                          her published estimate by an ambitious US$0.15 to US$2.15 per share. She believes
                          that when word of an unrealistically high earnings projection filters back to Hygene’s
                          investor-relations department, the company will feel compelled to update its earnings
                          guidance. Meanwhile, Gordon hopes that she is at least correct with respect to the
                          earnings direction and that she will help clients who act on her insights to profit from
                          a quick gain by trading on her advice.
                                  Comment: By exaggerating her earnings projections in order to try to fuel a
                                  quick gain in Hygene’s stock price, Gordon is in violation of Standard II(B).
                                  Furthermore, by virtue of previewing her intentions of revising upward her
                                  earnings projections to only a select group of clients, she is in violation of
                                  Standard III(B) Fair Dealing. However, it would have been acceptable for
                                  Gordon to write a report that

                              ■   framed her earnings projection in a range of possible outcomes,
                              ■   outlined clearly the assumptions used in her Hygene models that took into
                                  consideration the findings from her trip through Latin America, and
                              ■   was distributed to all Picador & Co. clients in an equitable manner.

Example 7 (Pump and Dump Strategy):
In an effort to pump up the price of his holdings in Moosehead & Belfast Railroad
Company, Steve Weinberg logs on to several investor chat rooms on the internet to
start rumors that the company is about to expand its rail network in anticipation of
receiving a large contract for shipping lumber.
       Comment: Weinberg has violated Standard II(B) by disseminating false
       information about Moosehead & Belfast with the intent to mislead market
       participants.



Example 8 (Manipulating Model Inputs):
Bill Mandeville supervises a structured financing team for Superior Investment Bank.
His responsibilities include packaging new structured investment products and man-
aging Superior’s relationship with relevant rating agencies. To achieve the best rating
possible, Mandeville uses mostly positive scenarios as model inputs—scenarios that
reflect minimal downside risk in the assets underlying the structured products. The
resulting output statistics in the rating request and underwriting prospectus support
the idea that the new structured products have minimal potential downside risk.
Additionally, Mandeville’s compensation from Superior is partially based on both
the level of the rating assigned and the successful sale of new structured investment
products but does not have a link to the long-term performance of the instruments.
    Mandeville is extremely successful and leads Superior as the top originator of
structured investment products for the next two years. In the third year, the economy
experiences difficulties and the values of the assets underlying structured products sig-
nificantly decline. The subsequent defaults lead to major turmoil in the capital markets,
the demise of Superior Investment Bank, and the loss of Mandeville’s employment.
       Comment: Mandeville manipulates the inputs of a model to minimize
       associated risk to achieve higher ratings. His understanding of structured
       products allows him to skillfully decide which inputs to include in support of
       the desired rating and price. This information manipulation for short-term
       gain, which is in violation of Standard II(B), ultimately causes significant
       damage to many parties and the capital markets as a whole. Mandeville
       should have realized that promoting a rating and price with inaccurate
       information could cause not only a loss of price confidence in the particular
       structured product but also a loss of investor trust in the system. Such loss
       of confidence affects the ability of the capital markets to operate efficiently.



Example 9 (Information Manipulation):
Allen King is a performance analyst for Torrey Investment Funds. King believes that
the portfolio manager for the firm’s small- and microcap equity fund dislikes him
because the manager never offers him tickets to the local baseball team’s games but
does offer tickets to other employees. To incite a potential regulatory review of the
manager, King creates user profiles on several online forums under the portfolio
manager’s name and starts rumors about potential mergers for several of the smaller
companies in the portfolio. As the prices of these companies’ stocks increase, the
portfolio manager sells the position, which leads to an investigation by the regulator
as King desired.
       Comment: King has violated Standard II(B) even though he did not per-
       sonally profit from the market’s reaction to the rumor. In posting the false
       information, King misleads others into believing the companies were likely

                          Standard III(A) clarifies that client interests are paramount. A member’s or candidate’s
                          responsibility to a client includes a duty of loyalty and a duty to exercise reasonable
                          care. Investment actions must be carried out for the sole benefit of the client and in a
                          manner the member or candidate believes, given the known facts and circumstances,
                          to be in the best interest of the client. Members and candidates must exercise the same
                          level of prudence, judgment, and care that they would apply in the management and
                          disposition of their own interests in similar circumstances.
                              Prudence requires caution and discretion. The exercise of prudence by invest-
                          ment professionals requires that they act with the care, skill, and diligence that a
                          reasonable person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would
                          use. In the context of managing a client’s portfolio, prudence requires following the
                          investment parameters set forth by the client and balancing risk and return. Acting
                          with care requires members and candidates to act in a prudent and judicious manner
                          in avoiding harm to clients.

Standard III: Duties to Clients                                                                113


     Standard III(A) sets minimum expectations for members and candidates when
fulfilling their responsibilities to their clients. Regulatory and legal requirements for
such duties can vary across the investment industry depending on a variety of factors,
including job function of the investment professional, the existence of an adviser/client
relationship, and the nature of the recommendations being offered. From the perspec-
tive of the end user of financial services, these different standards can be arcane and
confusing, leaving investors unsure of what level of service to expect from investment
professionals they employ. The single standard of conduct described in Standard III(A)
benefits investors by establishing a benchmark for the duties of loyalty, prudence, and
care and clarifies that all CFA Institute members and candidates, regardless of job
title, local laws, or cultural differences, are required to comply with these fundamental
responsibilities. Investors hiring members or candidates who must adhere to the duty
of loyalty, prudence, and care set forth in this standard can be confident that these
responsibilities are a requirement regardless of any legally imposed fiduciary duties.
     Standard III(A), however, is not a substitute for a member’s or candidate’s legal
or regulatory obligations. As stated in Standard I(A), members and candidates must
abide by the most strict requirements imposed on them by regulators or the Code and
Standards, including any legally imposed fiduciary duty. Members and candidates must
also be aware of whether they have “custody” or effective control of client assets. If so,
a heightened level of responsibility arises. Members and candidates are considered to
have custody if they have any direct or indirect access to client funds. Members and
candidates must manage any pool of assets in their control in accordance with the
terms of the governing documents (such as trust documents and investment man-
agement agreements), which are the primary determinant of the manager’s powers
and duties. Whenever their actions are contrary to provisions of those instruments
or applicable law, members and candidates are at risk of violating Standard III(A).

Understanding the Application of Loyalty, Prudence, and Care
Standard III(A) establishes a minimum benchmark for the duties of loyalty, prudence,
and care that are required of all members and candidates regardless of whether a legal
fiduciary duty applies. Although fiduciary duty often encompasses the principles of
loyalty, prudence, and care, Standard III(A) does not render all members and candidates
fiduciaries. The responsibilities of members and candidates for fulfilling their obligations
under this standard depend greatly on the nature of their professional responsibilities
and the relationships they have with clients. The conduct of members and candidates
may or may not rise to the level of being a fiduciary, depending on the type of client,
whether the member or candidate is giving investment advice, and the many facts and
circumstances surrounding a particular transaction or client relationship.
    Fiduciary duties are often imposed by law or regulation when an individual or
institution is charged with the duty of acting for the benefit of another party, such
as managing investment assets. The duty required in fiduciary relationships exceeds
what is acceptable in many other business relationships because a fiduciary is in an
enhanced position of trust. Although members and candidates must comply with any
legally imposed fiduciary duty, the Code and Standards neither impose such a legal
responsibility nor require all members or candidates to act as fiduciaries. However,
Standard III(A) requires members and candidates to work in the client’s best interest
no matter what the job function.
    A member or candidate who does not provide advisory services to a client but who
acts only as a trade execution professional must prudently work in the client’s interest
when completing requested trades. Acting in the client’s best interest requires these
professionals to use their skills and diligence to execute trades in the most favorable
terms that can be achieved. Members and candidates operating in such positions
must use care to operate within the parameters set by the client’s trading instructions.

                               Members and candidates may also operate in a blended environment where they
                          execute client trades and offer advice on a limited set of investment options. The extent
                          of the advisory arrangement and limitations should be outlined in the agreement with
                          the client at the outset of the relationship. For instance, members and candidates should
                          inform clients that the advice provided will be limited to the propriety products of
                          the firm and not include other products available on the market. Clients who want
                          access to a wider range of investment products would have the information necessary
                          to decide not to engage with members or candidates working under these restrictions.
                               Members and candidates operating in this blended context would comply with
                          their obligations by recommending the allowable products that are consistent with
                          the client’s objectives and risk tolerance. They would exercise care through diligently
                          aligning the client’s needs with the attributes of the products being recommended.
                          Members and candidates should place the client’s interests first by disregarding any
                          firm or personal interest in motivating a recommended transaction.
                               There is a large variety of professional relationships that members and candidates
                          have with their clients. Standard III(A) requires them to fulfill the obligations outlined
                          explicitly or implicitly in the client agreements to the best of their abilities and with
                          loyalty, prudence, and care. Whether a member or candidate is structuring a new secu-
                          ritization transaction, completing a credit rating analysis, or leading a public company,
                          he or she must work with prudence and care in delivering the agreed-on services.

                          Identifying the Actual Investment Client
                          The first step for members and candidates in fulfilling their duty of loyalty to clients
                          is to determine the identity of the “client” to whom the duty of loyalty is owed. In
                          the context of an investment manager managing the personal assets of an individual,
                          the client is easily identified. When the manager is responsible for the portfolios of
                          pension plans or trusts, however, the client is not the person or entity who hires the
                          manager but, rather, the beneficiaries of the plan or trust. The duty of loyalty is owed
                          to the ultimate beneficiaries.
                              In some situations, an actual client or group of beneficiaries may not exist. Members
                          and candidates managing a fund to an index or an expected mandate owe the duty of
                          loyalty, prudence, and care to invest in a manner consistent with the stated mandate.
                          The decisions of a fund’s manager, although benefiting all fund investors, do not have
                          to be based on an individual investor’s requirements and risk profile. Client loyalty and
                          care for those investing in the fund are the responsibility of members and candidates
                          who have an advisory relationship with those individuals.
                              Situations involving potential conflicts of interest with respect to responsibilities
                          to clients may be extremely complex because they may involve a number of competing
                          interests. The duty of loyalty, prudence, and care applies to a large number of per-
                          sons in varying capacities, but the exact duties may differ in many respects in accord
                          with the relationship with each client or each type of account in which the assets are
                          managed. Members and candidates must not only put their obligations to clients first
                          in all dealings but also endeavor to avoid all real or potential conflicts of interest.
                              Members and candidates with positions whose responsibilities do not include
                          direct investment management also have “clients” that must be considered. Just as
                          there are various types of advisory relationships, members and candidates must look
                          at their roles and responsibilities when making a determination of who their clients
                          are. Sometimes the client is easily identifiable; such is the case in the relationship
                          between a company executive and the firm’s public shareholders. At other times, the
                          client may be the investing public as a whole, in which case the goals of independence
                          and objectivity of research surpass the goal of loyalty to a single organization.

Developing the Client’s Portfolio
The duty of loyalty, prudence, and care owed to the individual client is especially
important because the professional investment manager typically possesses greater
knowledge in the investment arena than the client does. This disparity places the indi-
vidual client in a vulnerable position; the client must trust the manager. The manager
in these situations should ensure that the client’s objectives and expectations for the
performance of the account are realistic and suitable to the client’s circumstances
and that the risks involved are appropriate. In most circumstances, recommended
investment strategies should relate to the long-term objectives and circumstances
of the client.
    Particular care must be taken to detect whether the goals of the investment
manager or the firm in conducting business, selling products, and executing security
transactions potentially conflict with the best interests and objectives of the client.
When members and candidates cannot avoid potential conflicts between their firm
and clients’ interests, they must provide clear and factual disclosures of the circum-
stances to the clients.
    Members and candidates must follow any guidelines set by their clients for the
management of their assets. Some clients, such as charitable organizations and pension
plans, have strict investment policies that limit investment options to certain types
or classes of investment or prohibit investment in certain securities. Other organiza-
tions have aggressive policies that do not prohibit investments by type but, instead,
set criteria on the basis of the portfolio’s total risk and return.
    Investment decisions must be judged in the context of the total portfolio rather
than by individual investment within the portfolio. The member’s or candidate’s duty
is satisfied with respect to a particular investment if the individual has thoroughly
considered the investment’s place in the overall portfolio, the risk of loss and oppor-
tunity for gains, tax implications, and the diversification, liquidity, cash flow, and
overall return requirements of the assets or the portion of the assets for which the
manager is responsible.

Soft Commission Policies
An investment manager often has discretion over the selection of brokers executing
transactions. Conflicts may arise when an investment manager uses client brokerage
to purchase research services, a practice commonly called “soft dollars” or “soft com-
missions.” A member or candidate who pays a higher brokerage commission than he
or she would normally pay to allow for the purchase of goods or services, without
corresponding benefit to the client, violates the duty of loyalty to the client.
    From time to time, a client will direct a manager to use the client’s brokerage to
purchase goods or services for the client, a practice that is commonly called “directed
brokerage.” Because brokerage commission is an asset of the client and is used to
benefit that client, not the manager, such a practice does not violate any duty of
loyalty. However, a member or candidate is obligated to seek “best price” and “best
execution” and be assured by the client that the goods or services purchased from the
brokerage will benefit the account beneficiaries. “Best execution” refers to a trading
process that seeks to maximize the value of the client’s portfolio within the client’s
stated investment objectives and constraints. In addition, the member or candidate
should disclose to the client that the client may not be getting best execution from
the directed brokerage.

Proxy Voting Policies
The duty of loyalty, prudence, and care may apply in a number of situations facing the
investment professional besides those related directly to investing assets.

                              Part of a member’s or candidate’s duty of loyalty includes voting proxies in an
                          informed and responsible manner. Proxies have economic value to a client, and
                          members and candidates must ensure that they properly safeguard and maximize this
                          value. An investment manager who fails to vote, casts a vote without considering the
                          impact of the question, or votes blindly with management on nonroutine governance
                          issues (e.g., a change in company capitalization) may violate this standard. Voting of
                          proxies is an integral part of the management of investments.
                              A cost–benefit analysis may show that voting all proxies may not benefit the cli-
                          ent, so voting proxies may not be necessary in all instances. Members and candidates
                          should disclose to clients their proxy voting policies.




            22            STANDARD III(A): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES


                          Regular Account Information
                          Members and candidates with control of client assets (1) should submit to each cli-
                          ent, at least quarterly, an itemized statement showing the funds and securities in the
                          custody or possession of the member or candidate plus all debits, credits, and trans-
                          actions that occurred during the period, (2) should disclose to the client where the
                          assets are to be maintained, as well as where or when they are moved, and (3) should
                          separate the client’s assets from any other party’s assets, including the member’s or
                          candidate’s own assets.


                          Client Approval
                          If a member or candidate is uncertain about the appropriate course of action with
                          respect to a client, the member or candidate should consider what he or she would
                          expect or demand if the member or candidate were the client. If in doubt, a member
                          or candidate should disclose the questionable matter in writing to the client and
                          obtain client approval.


                          Firm Policies
                          Members and candidates should address and encourage their firms to address the
                          following topics when drafting the statements or manuals containing their policies
                          and procedures regarding responsibilities to clients:
                              ■   Follow all applicable rules and laws: Members and candidates must follow
                                  all legal requirements and applicable provisions of the Code and Standards.
                              ■   Establish the investment objectives of the client: Make a reasonable inquiry
                                  into a client’s investment experience, risk and return objectives, and finan-
                                  cial constraints prior to making investment recommendations or taking
                                  investment actions.
                              ■   Consider all the information when taking actions: When taking investment
                                  actions, members and candidates must consider the appropriateness and
                                  suitability of the investment relative to (1) the client’s needs and circum-
                                  stances, (2) the investment’s basic characteristics, and (3) the basic charac-
                                  teristics of the total portfolio.

   ■   Diversify: Members and candidates should diversify investments to reduce
       the risk of loss, unless diversification is not consistent with plan guidelines
       or is contrary to the account objectives.
   ■   Carry out regular reviews: Members and candidates should establish regular
       review schedules to ensure that the investments held in the account adhere
       to the terms of the governing documents.
   ■   Deal fairly with all clients with respect to investment actions: Members and
       candidates must not favor some clients over others and should establish pol-
       icies for allocating trades and disseminating investment recommendations.
   ■   Disclose conflicts of interest: Members and candidates must disclose all
       actual and potential conflicts of interest so that clients can evaluate those
       conflicts.
   ■   Disclose compensation arrangements: Members and candidates should make
       their clients aware of all forms of manager compensation.
   ■   Vote proxies: In most cases, members and candidates should determine
       who is authorized to vote shares and vote proxies in the best interests of the
       clients and ultimate beneficiaries.
   ■   Maintain confidentiality: Members and candidates must preserve the confi-
       dentiality of client information.
   ■   Seek best execution: Unless directed by the client as ultimate beneficiary,
       members and candidates must seek best execution for their clients. (Best
       execution is defined in the preceding text.)
   ■   Place client interests first: Members and candidates must serve the best
       interests of clients.




STANDARD III(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                         23
Example 1 (Identifying the Client—Plan Participants):
First Country Bank serves as trustee for the Miller Company’s pension plan. Miller
is the target of a hostile takeover attempt by Newton, Inc. In attempting to ward off
Newton, Miller’s managers persuade Julian Wiley, an investment manager at First
Country Bank, to purchase Miller common stock in the open market for the employee
pension plan. Miller’s officials indicate that such action would be favorably received
and would probably result in other accounts being placed with the bank. Although
Wiley believes the stock is overvalued and would not ordinarily buy it, he purchases
the stock to support Miller’s managers, to maintain Miller’s good favor toward the
bank, and to realize additional new business. The heavy stock purchases cause Miller’s
market price to rise to such a level that Newton retracts its takeover bid.
       Comment: Standard III(A) requires that a member or candidate, in evaluating
       a takeover bid, act prudently and solely in the interests of plan participants
       and beneficiaries. To meet this requirement, a member or candidate must
       carefully evaluate the long-term prospects of the company against the
       short-term prospects presented by the takeover offer and by the ability to
       invest elsewhere. In this instance, Wiley, acting on behalf of his employer,
       which was the trustee for a pension plan, clearly violated Standard III(A).
       He used the pension plan to perpetuate existing management, perhaps to
       the detriment of plan participants and the company’s shareholders, and

                                 to benefit himself. Wiley’s responsibilities to the plan participants and
                                 beneficiaries should have taken precedence over any ties of his bank to
                                 corporate managers and over his self-interest. Wiley had a duty to examine
                                 the takeover offer on its own merits and to make an independent decision.
                                 The guiding principle is the appropriateness of the investment decision to
                                 the pension plan, not whether the decision benefited Wiley or the company
                                 that hired him.



                          Example 2 (Client Commission Practices):
                          JNI, a successful investment counseling firm, serves as investment manager for the
                          pension plans of several large regionally based companies. Its trading activities gener-
                          ate a significant amount of commission-related business. JNI uses the brokerage and
                          research services of many firms, but most of its trading activity is handled through
                          a large brokerage company, Thompson, Inc., because the executives of the two firms
                          have a close friendship. Thompson’s commission structure is high in comparison with
                          charges for similar brokerage services from other firms. JNI considers Thompson’s
                          research services and execution capabilities average. In exchange for JNI directing
                          its brokerage to Thompson, Thompson absorbs a number of JNI overhead expenses,
                          including those for rent.
                                 Comment: JNI executives are breaching their responsibilities by using client
                                 brokerage for services that do not benefit JNI clients and by not obtaining
                                 best price and best execution for their clients. Because JNI executives are
                                 not upholding their duty of loyalty, they are violating Standard III(A).



                          Example 3 (Brokerage Arrangements):
                          Charlotte Everett, a struggling independent investment adviser, serves as investment
                          manager for the pension plans of several companies. One of her brokers, Scott
                          Company, is close to consummating management agreements with prospective new
                          clients whereby Everett would manage the new client accounts and trade the accounts
                          exclusively through Scott. One of Everett’s existing clients, Crayton Corporation, has
                          directed Everett to place securities transactions for Crayton’s account exclusively
                          through Scott. But to induce Scott to exert efforts to send more new accounts to her,
                          Everett also directs transactions to Scott from other clients without their knowledge.
                                 Comment: Everett has an obligation at all times to seek best price and best
                                 execution on all trades. Everett may direct new client trades exclusively
                                 through Scott Company as long as Everett receives best price and execution
                                 on the trades or receives a written statement from new clients that she is not
                                 to seek best price and execution and that they are aware of the consequence
                                 for their accounts. Everett may trade other accounts through Scott as a
                                 reward for directing clients to Everett only if the accounts receive best price
                                 and execution and the practice is disclosed to the accounts. Because Everett
                                 does not disclose the directed trading, Everett has violated Standard III(A).



                          Example 4 (Brokerage Arrangements):
                          Emilie Rome is a trust officer for Paget Trust Company. Rome’s supervisor is responsible
                          for reviewing Rome’s trust account transactions and her monthly reports of personal
                          stock transactions. Rome has been using Nathan Gray, a broker, almost exclusively for

trust account brokerage transactions. When Gray makes a market in stocks, he has
been giving Rome a lower price for personal purchases and a higher price for sales
than he gives to Rome’s trust accounts and other investors.
       Comment: Rome is violating her duty of loyalty to the bank’s trust accounts
       by using Gray for brokerage transactions simply because Gray trades Rome’s
       personal account on favorable terms. Rome is placing her own interests
       before those of her clients.



Example 5 (Client Commission Practices):
Lauren Parker, an analyst with Provo Advisors, covers South American equities for
her firm. She likes to travel to the markets for which she is responsible and decides to
go on a trip to Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The trip is sponsored by SouthAM, Inc.,
a research firm with a small broker/dealer affiliate that uses the clearing facilities of a
larger New York brokerage house. SouthAM specializes in arranging South American
trips for analysts during which they can meet with central bank officials, government
ministers, local economists, and senior executives of corporations. SouthAM accepts
commission dollars at a ratio of 2 to 1 against the hard-dollar costs of the research fee
for the trip. Parker is not sure that SouthAM’s execution is competitive, but without
informing her supervisor, she directs the trading desk at Provo to start giving com-
mission business to SouthAM so she can take the trip. SouthAM has conveniently
timed the briefing trip to coincide with the beginning of Carnival season, so Parker
also decides to spend five days of vacation in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the trip.
Parker uses commission dollars to pay for the five days of hotel expenses.
       Comment: Parker is violating Standard III(A) by not exercising her duty of
       loyalty to her clients. She should have determined whether the commis-
       sions charged by SouthAM are reasonable in relation to the benefit of the
       research provided by the trip. She also should have determined whether
       best execution and prices could be received from SouthAM. In addition,
       the five extra days are not part of the research effort because they do not
       assist in the investment decision making. Thus, the hotel expenses for the
       five days should not be paid for with client assets.


Example 6 (Excessive Trading):
Vida Knauss manages the portfolios of a number of high-net-worth individuals. A
major part of her investment management fee is based on trading commissions.
Knauss engages in extensive trading for each of her clients to ensure that she attains
the minimum commission level set by her firm. Although the securities purchased
and sold for the clients are appropriate and fall within the acceptable asset classes
for the clients, the amount of trading for each account exceeds what is necessary to
accomplish the client’s investment objectives.
       Comment: Knauss has violated Standard III(A) because she is using the
       assets of her clients to benefit her firm and herself.



Example 7 (Managing Family Accounts):
Adam Dill recently joined New Investments Asset Managers. To assist Dill in building
a book of clients, both his father and brother opened new fee-paying accounts. Dill
followed all the firm’s procedures in noting his relationships with these clients and in
developing their investment policy statements.

                              After several years, the number of Dill’s clients has grown, but he still manages
                          the original accounts of his family members. An IPO is coming to market that is a
                          suitable investment for many of his clients, including his brother. Dill does not receive
                          the amount of stock he requested, so to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest,
                          he does not allocate any shares to his brother’s account.
                                 Comment: Dill has violated Standard III(A) because he is not acting for the
                                 benefit of his brother’s account as well as his other accounts. The brother’s
                                 account is a regular fee-paying account comparable to the accounts of
                                 his other clients. By not allocating the shares proportionately across all
                                 accounts for which he thought the IPO was suitable, Dill is disadvantaging
                                 specific clients.
                                     Dill would have been correct in not allocating shares to his brother’s
                                 account if that account was being managed outside the normal fee struc-
                                 ture of the firm.


                          Example 8 (Identifying the Client):
                          Donna Hensley has been hired by a law firm to testify as an expert witness. Although
                          the testimony is intended to represent impartial advice, she is concerned that her work
                          may have negative consequences for the law firm. If the law firm is Hensley’s client,
                          how does she ensure that her testimony will not violate the required duty of loyalty,
                          prudence, and care to one’s client?
                                 Comment: In this situation, the law firm represents Hensley’s employer
                                 and the aspect of “who is the client” is not well defined. When acting as
                                 an expert witness, Hensley is bound by the standard of independence and
                                 objectivity in the same manner as an independent research analyst would
                                 be bound. Hensley must not let the law firm influence the testimony she
                                 provides in the legal proceedings.



                          Example 9 (Identifying the Client):
                          Jon Miller is a mutual fund portfolio manager. The fund is focused on the global
                          financial services sector. Wanda Spears is a private wealth manager in the same city
                          as Miller and is a friend of Miller. At a local CFA Institute society meeting, Spears
                          mentions to Miller that her new client is an investor in Miller’s fund. She states that
                          the two of them now share a responsibility to this client.
                                 Comment: Spears’ statement is not totally correct. Because she provides
                                 the advisory services to her new client, she alone is bound by the duty of
                                 loyalty to this client. Miller’s responsibility is to manage the fund according
                                 to the investment policy statement of the fund. His actions should not be
                                 influenced by the needs of any particular fund investor.



                          Example 10 (Client Loyalty):
                          After providing client account investment performance to the external-facing depart-
                          ments but prior to it being finalized for release to clients, Teresa Nguyen, an invest-
                          ment performance analyst, notices the reporting system missed a trade. Correcting
                          the omission resulted in a large loss for a client that had previously placed the firm
                          on “watch” for potential termination owing to underperformance in prior periods.
                          Nguyen knows this news is unpleasant but informs the appropriate individuals that
                          the report needs to be updated before releasing it to the client.

Standard III(B) Fair Dealing                                                                 121


       Comment: Nguyen’s actions align with the requirements of Standard III(A).
       Even though the correction may lead to the firm’s termination by the cli-
       ent, withholding information on errors would not be in the best interest
       of the client.



Example 11 (Execution-Only Responsibilities):
Baftija Sulejman recently became a candidate in the CFA Program. He is a broker who
executes client-directed trades for several high-net-worth individuals. Sulejman does
not provide any investment advice and only executes the trading decisions made by
clients. He is concerned that the Code and Standards impose a fiduciary duty on him
in his dealing with clients and sends an e-mail to the CFA Ethics Helpdesk (ethics@​
cfainstitute​.org) to seek guidance on this issue.
       Comment: In this instance, Sulejman serves in an execution-only capacity
       and his duty of loyalty, prudence, and care is centered on the skill and
       diligence used when executing trades—namely, by seeking best execution
       and making trades within the parameters set by the clients (instructions
       on quantity, price, timing, etc.). Acting in the best interests of the client
       dictates that trades are executed on the most favorable terms that can be
       achieved for the client. Given this job function, the requirements of the
       Code and Standards for loyalty, prudence, and care clearly do not impose
       a fiduciary duty.

                          Standard III(B) requires members and candidates to treat all clients fairly when
                          disseminating investment recommendations or making material changes to prior
                          investment recommendations or when taking investment action with regard to gen-
                          eral purchases, new issues, or secondary offerings. Only through the fair treatment
                          of all parties can the investment management profession maintain the confidence of
                          the investing public.
                              When an investment adviser has multiple clients, the potential exists for the adviser
                          to favor one client over another. This favoritism may take various forms—from the
                          quality and timing of services provided to the allocation of investment opportunities.
                              The term “fairly” implies that the member or candidate must take care not to
                          discriminate against any clients when disseminating investment recommendations or
                          taking investment action. Standard III(B) does not state “equally” because members
                          and candidates could not possibly reach all clients at exactly the same time—whether
                          by printed mail, telephone (including text messaging), computer (including internet
                          updates and e-mail distribution), facsimile (fax), or wire. Each client has unique needs,
                          investment criteria, and investment objectives, so not all investment opportunities
                          are suitable for all clients. In addition, members and candidates may provide more
                          personal, specialized, or in-depth service to clients who are willing to pay for premium
                          services through higher management fees or higher levels of brokerage. Members and
                          candidates may differentiate their services to clients, but different levels of service
                          must not disadvantage or negatively affect clients. In addition, the different service
                          levels should be disclosed to clients and prospective clients and should be available
                          to everyone (i.e., different service levels should not be offered selectively).
                              Standard III(B) covers conduct in two broadly defined categories—investment
                          recommendations and investment action.

                          Investment Recommendations
                          The first category of conduct involves members and candidates whose primary func-
                          tion is the preparation of investment recommendations to be disseminated either to
                          the public or within a firm for the use of others in making investment decisions. This
                          group includes members and candidates employed by investment counseling, advisory,
                          or consulting firms as well as banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies. The
                          criterion is that the member’s or candidate’s primary responsibility is the preparation
                          of recommendations to be acted on by others, including those in the member’s or
                          candidate’s organization.
                               An investment recommendation is any opinion expressed by a member or candi-
                          date in regard to purchasing, selling, or holding a given security or other investment.
                          The opinion may be disseminated to customers or clients through an initial detailed
                          research report, through a brief update report, by addition to or deletion from a list
                          of recommended securities, or simply by oral communication. A recommendation
                          that is distributed to anyone outside the organization is considered a communication
                          for general distribution under Standard III(B).
                               Standard III(B) addresses the manner in which investment recommendations or
                          changes in prior recommendations are disseminated to clients. Each member or can-
                          didate is obligated to ensure that information is disseminated in such a manner that
                          all clients have a fair opportunity to act on every recommendation. Communicating
                          with all clients on a uniform basis presents practical problems for members and can-
                          didates because of differences in timing and methods of communication with various
                          types of customers and clients. Members and candidates should encourage their firms
                          to design an equitable system to prevent selective or discriminatory disclosure and
                          should inform clients about what kind of communications they will receive.
                               The duty to clients imposed by Standard III(B) may be more critical when mem-
                          bers or candidates change their recommendations than when they make initial
                          recommendations. Material changes in a member’s or candidate’s prior investment

Standard III(B) Fair Dealing                                                                 123


recommendations because of subsequent research should be communicated to all
current clients; particular care should be taken that the information reaches those
clients who the member or candidate knows have acted on or been affected by the
earlier advice. Clients who do not know that the member or candidate has changed a
recommendation and who, therefore, place orders contrary to a current recommenda-
tion should be advised of the changed recommendation before the order is accepted.

Investment Action
The second category of conduct includes those members and candidates whose pri-
mary function is taking investment action (portfolio management) on the basis of
recommendations prepared internally or received from external sources. Investment
action, like investment recommendations, can affect market value. Consequently,
Standard III(B) requires that members or candidates treat all clients fairly in light of
their investment objectives and circumstances. For example, when making invest-
ments in new offerings or in secondary financings, members and candidates should
distribute the issues to all customers for whom the investments are appropriate in a
manner consistent with the policies of the firm for allocating blocks of stock. If the
issue is oversubscribed, then the issue should be prorated to all subscribers. This action
should be taken on a round-lot basis to avoid odd-lot distributions. In addition, if
the issue is oversubscribed, members and candidates should forgo any sales to them-
selves or their immediate families in order to free up additional shares for clients. If
the investment professional’s family-member accounts are managed similarly to the
accounts of other clients of the firm, however, the family-member accounts should
not be excluded from buying such shares.
    Members and candidates must make every effort to treat all individual and insti-
tutional clients in a fair and impartial manner. A member or candidate may have
multiple relationships with an institution; for example, the member or candidate
may be a corporate trustee, pension fund manager, manager of funds for individuals
employed by the customer, loan originator, or creditor. A member or candidate must
exercise care to treat all clients fairly.
    Members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients the
documented allocation procedures they or their firms have in place and how the
procedures would affect the client or prospect. The disclosure should be clear and
complete so that the client can make an informed investment decision. Even when
complete disclosure is made, however, members and candidates must put client interests
ahead of their own. A member’s or candidate’s duty of fairness and loyalty to clients
can never be overridden by client consent to patently unfair allocation procedures.
    Treating clients fairly also means that members and candidates should not take
advantage of their position in the industry to the detriment of clients. For instance, in
the context of IPOs, members and candidates must make bona fide public distributions
of “hot issue” securities (defined as securities of a public offering that are trading at
a premium in the secondary market whenever such trading commences because of
the great demand for the securities). Members and candidates are prohibited from
withholding such securities for their own benefit and must not use such securities as
a reward or incentive to gain benefit.

            25            STANDARD III(B): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES


                          Develop Firm Policies
                          Although Standard III(B) refers to a member’s or candidate’s responsibility to deal
                          fairly and objectively with clients, members and candidates should also encourage
                          their firms to establish compliance procedures requiring all employees who dissemi-
                          nate investment recommendations or take investment actions to treat customers and
                          clients fairly. At the very least, a member or candidate should recommend appropriate
                          procedures to management if none are in place. And the member or candidate should
                          make management aware of possible violations of fair-dealing practices within the
                          firm when they come to the attention of the member or candidate.
                              The extent of the formality and complexity of such compliance procedures depends
                          on the nature and size of the organization and the type of securities involved. An
                          investment adviser who is a sole proprietor and handles only discretionary accounts
                          might not disseminate recommendations to the public, but that adviser should have
                          formal written procedures to ensure that all clients receive fair investment action.
                              Good business practice dictates that initial recommendations be made available
                          to all customers who indicate an interest. Although a member or candidate need not
                          communicate a recommendation to all customers, the selection process by which
                          customers receive information should be based on suitability and known interest,
                          not on any preferred or favored status. A common practice to assure fair dealing is
                          to communicate recommendations simultaneously within the firm and to customers.
                              Members and candidates should consider the following points when establishing
                          fair-dealing compliance procedures:
                              ■   Limit the number of people involved: Members and candidates should make
                                  reasonable efforts to limit the number of people who are privy to the fact
                                  that a recommendation is going to be disseminated.
                              ■   Shorten the time frame between decision and dissemination: Members and
                                  candidates should make reasonable efforts to limit the amount of time that
                                  elapses between the decision to make an investment recommendation and
                                  the time the actual recommendation is disseminated. If a detailed institu-
                                  tional recommendation that might take two or three weeks to publish is
                                  in preparation, a short summary report including the conclusion might be
                                  published in advance. In an organization where both a research committee
                                  and an investment policy committee must approve a recommendation, the
                                  meetings should be held on the same day if possible. The process of review-
                                  ing reports and printing and mailing them, faxing them, or distributing
                                  them by e-mail necessarily involves the passage of time, sometimes long
                                  periods of time. In large firms with extensive review processes, the time fac-
                                  tor is usually not within the control of the analyst who prepares the report.
                                  Thus, many firms and their analysts communicate to customers and firm
                                  personnel the new or changed recommendations by an update or “flash”
                                  report. The communication technique might be fax, e-mail, wire, or short
                                  written report.
                              ■   Publish guidelines for pre-dissemination behavior: Members and candidates
                                  should encourage firms to develop guidelines that prohibit personnel who
                                  have prior knowledge of an investment recommendation from discussing or
                                  taking any action on the pending recommendation.

Standard III(B): Recommended Procedures                                                   125


   ■   Simultaneous dissemination: Members and candidates should establish
       procedures for the timing of dissemination of investment recommendations
       so that all clients are treated fairly—that is, are informed at approximately
       the same time. For example, if a firm is going to announce a new recom-
       mendation, supervisory personnel should time the announcement to avoid
       placing any client or group of clients at an unfair advantage relative to other
       clients. A communication to all branch offices should be sent at the time of
       the general announcement. (When appropriate, the firm should accompany
       the announcement of a new recommendation with a statement that trading
       restrictions for the firm’s employees are now in effect. The trading restric-
       tions should stay in effect until the recommendation is widely distributed
       to all relevant clients.) Once this distribution has occurred, the member or
       candidate may follow up separately with individual clients, but members and
       candidates should not give favored clients advance information when such
       advance notification may disadvantage other clients.
   ■   Maintain a list of clients and their holdings: Members and candidates should
       maintain a list of all clients and the securities or other investments each
       client holds in order to facilitate notification of customers or clients of a
       change in an investment recommendation. If a particular security or other
       investment is to be sold, such a list can be used to ensure that all holders are
       treated fairly in the liquidation of that particular investment.
   ■   Develop and document trade allocation procedures: When formulating pro-
       cedures for allocating trades, members and candidates should develop a set
       of guiding principles that ensure

       ●   fairness to advisory clients, both in priority of execution of orders and
           in the allocation of the price obtained in execution of block orders or
           trades,
       ●   timeliness and efficiency in the execution of orders, and
       ●   accuracy of the member’s or candidate’s records as to trade orders and
           client account positions.
   With these principles in mind, members and candidates should develop or encour-
age their firm to develop written allocation procedures, with particular attention to
procedures for block trades and new issues. Procedures to consider are as follows:
   ■   requiring orders and modifications or cancellations of orders to be docu-
       mented and time stamped;
   ■   processing and executing orders on a first-in, first-out basis with consider-
       ation of bundling orders for efficiency as appropriate for the asset class or
       the security;
   ■   developing a policy to address such issues as calculating execution prices
       and “partial fills” when trades are grouped, or in a block, for efficiency;
   ■   giving all client accounts participating in a block trade the same execution
       price and charging the same commission;
   ■   when the full amount of the block order is not executed, allocating partially
       executed orders among the participating client accounts pro rata on the
       basis of order size while not going below an established minimum lot size
       for some securities (e.g., bonds); and
   ■   when allocating trades for new issues, obtaining advance indications of
       interest, allocating securities by client (rather than portfolio manager), and
       providing a method for calculating allocations.

                          Disclose Trade Allocation Procedures
                          Members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients how they
                          select accounts to participate in an order and how they determine the amount of
                          securities each account will buy or sell. Trade allocation procedures must be fair
                          and equitable, and disclosure of inequitable allocation methods does not relieve the
                          member or candidate of this obligation.


                          Establish Systematic Account Review
                          Member and candidate supervisors should review each account on a regular basis to
                          ensure that no client or customer is being given preferential treatment and that the
                          investment actions taken for each account are suitable for each account’s objectives.
                          Because investments should be based on individual needs and circumstances, an
                          investment manager may have good reasons for placing a given security or other
                          investment in one account while selling it from another account and should fully
                          document the reasons behind both sides of the transaction. Members and candidates
                          should encourage firms to establish review procedures, however, to detect whether
                          trading in one account is being used to benefit a favored client.


                          Disclose Levels of Service
                          Members and candidates should disclose to all clients whether the organization offers
                          different levels of service to clients for the same fee or different fees. Different levels
                          of service should not be offered to clients selectively.

                          Bradley Ames, a well-known and respected analyst, follows the computer industry. In
                          the course of his research, he finds that a small, relatively unknown company whose
                          shares are traded over the counter has just signed significant contracts with some
                          of the companies he follows. After a considerable amount of investigation, Ames
                          decides to write a research report on the small company and recommend purchase
                          of its shares. While the report is being reviewed by the company for factual accuracy,
                          Ames schedules a luncheon with several of his best clients to discuss the company. At
                          the luncheon, he mentions the purchase recommendation scheduled to be sent early
                          the following week to all the firm’s clients.
                                 Comment: Ames has violated Standard III(B) by disseminating the purchase
                                 recommendation to the clients with whom he has lunch a week before the
                                 recommendation is sent to all clients.



                          Example 2 (Fair Dealing between Funds):
                          Spencer Rivers, president of XYZ Corporation, moves his company’s growth-oriented
                          pension fund to a particular bank primarily because of the excellent investment
                          performance achieved by the bank’s commingled fund for the prior five-year period.
                          Later, Rivers compares the results of his pension fund with those of the bank’s

commingled fund. He is startled to learn that, even though the two accounts have the
same investment objectives and similar portfolios, his company’s pension fund has
significantly underperformed the bank’s commingled fund. Questioning this result at
his next meeting with the pension fund’s manager, Rivers is told that, as a matter of
policy, when a new security is placed on the recommended list, Morgan Jackson, the
pension fund manager, first purchases the security for the commingled account and
then purchases it on a pro rata basis for all other pension fund accounts. Similarly,
when a sale is recommended, the security is sold first from the commingled account
and then sold on a pro rata basis from all other accounts. Rivers also learns that if
the bank cannot get enough shares (especially of hot issues) to be meaningful to all
the accounts, its policy is to place the new issues only in the commingled account.
    Seeing that Rivers is neither satisfied nor pleased by the explanation, Jackson
quickly adds that nondiscretionary pension accounts and personal trust accounts have
a lower priority on purchase and sale recommendations than discretionary pension
fund accounts. Furthermore, Jackson states, the company’s pension fund had the
opportunity to invest up to 5% in the commingled fund.
       Comment: The bank’s policy does not treat all customers fairly, and Jackson
       has violated her duty to her clients by giving priority to the growth-oriented
       commingled fund over all other funds and to discretionary accounts over
       nondiscretionary accounts. Jackson must execute orders on a systematic
       basis that is fair to all clients. In addition, trade allocation procedures
       should be disclosed to all clients when they become clients. Of course, in
       this case, disclosure of the bank’s policy would not change the fact that
       the policy is unfair.



Example 3 (Fair Dealing and IPO Distribution):
Dominic Morris works for a small regional securities firm. His work consists of corpo-
rate finance activities and investing for institutional clients. Arena, Ltd., is planning to
go public. The partners have secured rights to buy an arena football league franchise
and are planning to use the funds from the issue to complete the purchase. Because
arena football is the current rage, Morris believes he has a hot issue on his hands.
He has quietly negotiated some options for himself for helping convince Arena to do
the financing through his securities firm. When he seeks expressions of interest, the
institutional buyers oversubscribe the issue. Morris, assuming that the institutions
have the financial clout to drive the stock up, then fills all orders (including his own)
and decreases the institutional blocks.
       Comment: Morris has violated Standard III(B) by not treating all custom-
       ers fairly. He should not have taken any shares himself and should have
       prorated the shares offered among all clients. In addition, he should have
       disclosed to his firm and to his clients that he received options as part of
       the deal [see Standard VI(A) Disclosure of Conflicts].



Example 4 (Fair Dealing and Transaction Allocation):
Eleanor Preston, the chief investment officer of Porter Williams Investments (PWI),
a medium-size money management firm, has been trying to retain a client, Colby
Company. Management at Colby, which accounts for almost half of PWI’s reve-
nues, recently told Preston that if the performance of its account did not improve,
it would find a new money manager. Shortly after this threat, Preston purchases
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) for several accounts, including Colby’s. Preston
is busy with a number of transactions that day, so she fails to allocate the trades

                          immediately or write up the trade tickets. A few days later, when Preston is allocating
                          trades, she notes that some of the MBSs have significantly increased in price and some
                          have dropped. Preston decides to allocate the profitable trades to Colby and spread
                          the losing trades among several other PWI accounts.
                                 Comment: Preston has violated Standard III(B) by failing to deal fairly with
                                 her clients in taking these investment actions. Preston should have allocated
                                 the trades prior to executing the orders, or she should have had a systematic
                                 approach to allocating the trades, such as pro rata, as soon as practical
                                 after they were executed. Among other things, Preston must disclose to
                                 the client that the adviser may act as broker for, receive commissions from,
                                 and have a potential conflict of interest regarding both parties in agency
                                 cross-transactions. After the disclosure, she should obtain from the client
                                 consent authorizing such transactions in advance.


                          Example 5 (Selective Disclosure):
                          Saunders Industrial Waste Management (SIWM) publicly indicates to analysts that
                          it is comfortable with the somewhat disappointing earnings-per-share projection
                          of US$1.16 for the quarter. Bernard Roberts, an analyst at Coffey Investments, is
                          confident that SIWM management has understated the forecasted earnings so that
                          the real announcement will cause an “upside surprise” and boost the price of SIWM
                          stock. The “whisper number” (rumored) estimate based on extensive research and
                          discussed among knowledgeable analysts is higher than US$1.16. Roberts repeats the
                          US$1.16 figure in his research report to all Coffey clients but informally tells his large
                          clients that he expects the earnings per share to be higher, making SIWM a good buy.
                                 Comment: By not sharing his opinion regarding the potential for a significant
                                 upside earnings surprise with all clients, Roberts is not treating all clients
                                 fairly and has violated Standard III(B).



                          Example 6 (Additional Services for Select Clients):
                          Jenpin Weng uses e-mail to issue a new recommendation to all his clients. He then
                          calls his three largest institutional clients to discuss the recommendation in detail.
                                 Comment: Weng has not violated Standard III(B) because he widely dissem-
                                 inated the recommendation and provided the information to all his clients
                                 prior to discussing it with a select few. Weng’s largest clients received addi-
                                 tional personal service because they presumably pay higher fees or because
                                 they have a large amount of assets under Weng’s management. If Weng had
                                 discussed the report with a select group of clients prior to distributing it
                                 to all his clients, he would have violated Standard III(B).



                          Example 7 (Minimum Lot Allocations):
                          Lynn Hampton is a well-respected private wealth manager in her community with
                          a diversified client base. She determines that a new 10-year bond being offered by
                          Healthy Pharmaceuticals is appropriate for five of her clients. Three clients request
                          to purchase US$10,000 each, and the other two request US$50,000 each. The mini-
                          mum lot size is established at US$5,000, and the issue is oversubscribed at the time
                          of placement. Her firm’s policy is that odd-lot allocations, especially those below the
                          minimum, should be avoided because they may affect the liquidity of the security at
                          the time of sale.

   Hampton is informed she will receive only US$55,000 of the offering for all
accounts. Hampton distributes the bond investments as follows: The three accounts
that requested US$10,000 are allocated US$5,000 each, and the two accounts that
requested US$50,000 are allocated US$20,000 each.
       Comment: Hampton has not violated Standard III(B), even though the
       distribution is not on a completely pro rata basis because of the required
       minimum lot size. With the total allocation being significantly below the
       amount requested, Hampton ensured that each client received at least the
       minimum lot size of the issue. This approach allowed the clients to efficiently
       sell the bond later if necessary.



Example 8 (Excessive Trading):
Ling Chan manages the accounts for many pension plans, including the plan of his
father’s employer. Chan developed similar but not identical investment policies for
each client, so the investment portfolios are rarely the same. To minimize the cost to
his father’s pension plan, he intentionally trades more frequently in the accounts of
other clients to ensure the required brokerage is incurred to continue receiving free
research for use by all the pensions.
       Comment: Chan is violating Standard III(B) because his trading actions are
       disadvantaging his clients to enhance a relationship with a preferred client.
       All clients are benefiting from the research being provided and should incur
       their fair portion of the costs. This does not mean that additional trading
       should occur if a client has not paid an equal portion of the commission;
       trading should occur only as required by the strategy.



Example 9 (Limited Social Media Disclosures):
Mary Burdette was recently hired by Fundamental Investment Management (FIM)
as a junior auto industry analyst. Burdette is expected to expand the social media
presence of the firm because she is active with various networks, including Facebook,
LinkedIn, and X. Although Burdette’s supervisor, Joe Graf, has never used social media,
he encourages Burdette to explore opportunities to increase FIM’s online presence
and ability to share content, communicate, and broadcast information to clients. In
response to Graf ’s encouragement, Burdette is working on a proposal detailing the
advantages of getting FIM onto X in addition to launching a company Facebook page.
    As part of her auto industry research for FIM, Burdette is completing a report on
the financial impact of Sun Drive Auto Ltd.’s new solar technology for compact auto-
mobiles. This research report will be her first for FIM, and she believes Sun Drive’s
technology could revolutionize the auto industry. In her excitement, Burdette sends
a quick post to FIM X followers summarizing her “buy” recommendation for Sun
Drive Auto stock.
       Comment: Burdette has violated Standard III(B) by sending an investment
       recommendation to a select group of contacts prior to distributing it to all
       clients. Burdette must make sure she has received the appropriate training
       about FIM’s policies and procedures, including the appropriate business
       use of personal social media networks, before engaging in such activities.

                          Example 10 (Fair Dealing between Clients):
                          Paul Rove, performance analyst for Alpha-Beta Investment Management, is describing
                          to the firm’s chief investment officer (CIO) two new reports he would like to develop
                          to assist the firm in meeting its obligations to treat clients fairly. Because many of the
                          firm’s clients have similar investment objectives and portfolios, Rove suggests a report
                          detailing securities owned across several clients and the percentage of the portfolio the
                          security represents. The second report would compare the monthly performance of
                          portfolios with similar strategies. The outliers within each report would be submitted
                          to the CIO for review.
                                 Comment: As a performance analyst, Rove likely has little direct contact
                                 with clients and thus has limited opportunity to treat clients differently.
                                 The recommended reports comply with Standard III(B) while helping the
                                 firm conduct after-the-fact reviews of how effectively the firm’s advisers
                                 are dealing with their clients’ portfolios. Reports that monitor the fair
                                 treatment of clients are an important oversight tool to ensure that clients
                                 are treated fairly.

    ■   The Need for Diversification

Standard III(C) requires that members and candidates who are in an investment
advisory relationship with clients consider carefully the needs, circumstances, and
objectives of the clients when determining the appropriateness and suitability of a given
investment or course of investment action. An appropriate suitability determination
will not, however, prevent some investments or investment actions from losing value.
     In judging the suitability of a potential investment, the member or candidate
should review many aspects of the client’s knowledge, experience related to investing,
and financial situation. These aspects include, but are not limited to, the risk profile
of the investment as compared with the constraints of the client, the impact of the
investment on the diversity of the portfolio, and whether the client has the means or
net worth to assume the associated risk. The investment professional’s determination
of suitability should reflect only the investment recommendations or actions that a
prudent person would be willing to undertake. Not every investment opportunity
will be suitable for every portfolio, regardless of the potential return being offered.
     The responsibilities of members and candidates to gather information and make
a suitability analysis prior to making a recommendation or taking investment action
fall on those members and candidates who provide investment advice in the course of
an advisory relationship with a client. Other members and candidates may be simply
executing specific instructions for retail clients when buying or selling securities, such
as shares in mutual funds. These members and candidates and some others, such as
sell-side analysts, may not have the opportunity to judge the suitability of a particular
investment for the ultimate client.

Developing an Investment Policy
When an advisory relationship exists, members and candidates must gather client
information at the inception of the relationship. Such information includes the cli-
ent’s financial circumstances, personal data (such as age and occupation) that are
relevant to investment decisions, attitudes toward risk, and objectives in investing.
This information should be incorporated into a written investment policy statement
(IPS) that addresses the client’s risk tolerance, return requirements, and all investment
constraints (including time horizon, liquidity needs, tax concerns, legal and regulatory
factors, and unique circumstances). Without identifying such client factors, members
and candidates cannot judge whether a particular investment or strategy is suitable
for a particular client. The IPS also should identify and describe the roles and respon-
sibilities of the parties to the advisory relationship and investment process, as well as
schedules for review and evaluation of the IPS. After formulating long-term capital
market expectations, members and candidates can assist in developing an appropriate
strategic asset allocation and investment program for the client, whether these are
presented in separate documents or incorporated in the IPS or in appendices to the IPS.

                          Understanding the Client’s Risk Profile
                          One of the most important factors to be considered in matching appropriateness and
                          suitability of an investment with a client’s needs and circumstances is measuring that
                          client’s tolerance for risk. The investment professional must consider the possibilities
                          of rapidly changing investment environments and their likely impact on a client’s
                          holdings, both individual securities and the collective portfolio. The risk of many
                          investment strategies can and should be analyzed and quantified in advance.
                              The use of synthetic investment vehicles and derivative investment products has
                          introduced particular issues of risk. Members and candidates should pay careful
                          attention to the leverage inherent in many of these vehicles or products when con-
                          sidering them for use in a client’s investment program. Such leverage and limited
                          liquidity, depending on the degree to which they are hedged, bear directly on the
                          issue of suitability for the client.

                          Updating an Investment Policy
                          Updating the IPS should be repeated at least annually and also prior to material
                          changes to any specific investment recommendations or decisions on behalf of the
                          client. The effort to determine the needs and circumstances of each client is not a
                          one-time occurrence. Investment recommendations or decisions are usually part of an
                          ongoing process that takes into account the diversity and changing nature of portfolio
                          and client characteristics. The passage of time is bound to produce changes that are
                          important with respect to investment objectives.
                              For an individual client, important changes might include the number of depen-
                          dents, personal tax status, health, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, amount of wealth
                          beyond that represented in the portfolio, and extent to which compensation and other
                          income provide for current income needs. With respect to an institutional client, such
                          changes might relate to the magnitude of unfunded liabilities in a pension fund, the
                          withdrawal privileges in an employee savings plan, or the distribution requirements
                          of a charitable foundation. Without efforts to update information concerning client
                          factors, one or more factors could change without the investment manager’s knowledge.
                              Suitability review can be done most effectively when the client fully discloses his
                          or her complete financial portfolio, including those portions not managed by the
                          member or candidate. If clients withhold information about their financial portfolios,
                          the suitability analysis conducted by members and candidates cannot be expected to
                          be complete; it must be based on the information provided.

                          The Need for Diversification
                          The investment profession has long recognized that combining several different
                          investments is likely to provide a more acceptable level of risk exposure than having
                          all assets in a single investment. The unique characteristics (or risks) of an individual
                          investment may become partially or entirely neutralized when it is combined with
                          other individual investments within a portfolio. Some reasonable amount of diversifi-
                          cation is thus the norm for many portfolios, especially those managed by individuals
                          or institutions that have some degree of legal fiduciary responsibility.
                               An investment with high relative risk on its own may be a suitable investment in
                          the context of the entire portfolio or when the client’s stated objectives contemplate
                          speculative or risky investments. The manager may be responsible for only a portion of
                          the client’s total portfolio, or the client may not have provided a full financial picture.
                          Members and candidates can be responsible for assessing the suitability of an invest-
                          ment only on the basis of the information and criteria actually provided by the client.

Addressing Unsolicited Trading Requests
Members and candidates may receive requests from a client for trades that do not
properly align with the risk and return objectives outlined in the client’s investment
policy statement. These transaction requests may be based on the client’s individual
biases or professional experience. Members and candidates will need to make rea-
sonable efforts to balance their clients’ trading requests with their responsibilities to
follow the agreed-on investment policy statement.
    In cases of unsolicited trade requests that a member or candidate knows are unsuit-
able for a client, the member or candidate should refrain from making the trade until
he or she discusses the concerns with the client. The discussions and resulting actions
may encompass a variety of scenarios depending on how the requested unsuitable
investment relates to the client’s full portfolio.
    Many times, an unsolicited request may be expected to have only a minimum impact
on the entire portfolio because the size of the requested trade is small or the trade
would result in a limited change to the portfolio’s risk profile. In discussing the trade,
the member or candidate should focus on educating the investor on how the request
deviates from the current policy statement. Following the discussion, the member or
candidate may follow his or her firm’s policies regarding the necessary client approval
for executing unsuitable trades. At a minimum, the client should acknowledge the
discussion and accept the conditions that make the recommendation unsuitable.
    Should the unsolicited request be expected to have a material impact on the port-
folio, the member or candidate should use this opportunity to update the investment
policy statement. Doing so would allow the client to fully understand the potential
effect of the requested trade on his or her current goals or risk levels.
    Members and candidates may have some clients who decline to modify their
policy statements while insisting an unsolicited trade be made. In such instances,
members or candidates will need to evaluate the effectiveness of their services to the
client. The options available to the members or candidates will depend on the services
provided by their employer. Some firms may allow for the trade to be executed in a
new unmanaged account. If alternative options are not available, members and can-
didates ultimately will need to determine whether they should continue the advisory
arrangement with the client.

Managing to an Index or Mandate
Some members and candidates do not manage money for individuals but are respon-
sible for managing a fund to an index or an expected mandate. The responsibility of
these members and candidates is to invest in a manner consistent with the stated
mandate. For example, a member or candidate who serves as the fund manager for a
large-cap income fund would not be following the fund mandate by investing heavily
in small-cap or start-up companies whose stock is speculative in nature. Members
and candidates who manage pooled assets to a specific mandate are not responsible
for determining the suitability of the fund as an investment for investors who may be
purchasing shares in the fund. The responsibility for determining the suitability of an
investment for clients can be conferred only on members and candidates who have
an advisory relationship with clients.

                          Investment Policy Statement
                          To fulfill the basic provisions of Standard III(C), a member or candidate should put
                          the needs and circumstances of each client and the client’s investment objectives into
                          a written investment policy statement. In formulating an investment policy for the
                          client, the member or candidate should take the following into consideration:
                              ■   client identification—(1) type and nature of client, (2) the existence of sepa-
                                  rate beneficiaries, and (3) approximate portion of total client assets that the
                                  member or candidate is managing;
                              ■   investor objectives—(1) return objectives (income, growth in principal,
                                  maintenance of purchasing power) and (2) risk tolerance (suitability, stabil-
                                  ity of values);
                              ■   investor constraints—(1) liquidity needs, (2) expected cash flows (patterns
                                  of additions and/or withdrawals), (3) investable funds (assets and liabili-
                                  ties or other commitments), (4) time horizon, (5) tax considerations, (6)
                                  regulatory and legal circumstances, (7) investor preferences, prohibitions,
                                  circumstances, and unique needs, and (8) proxy voting responsibilities and
                                  guidance; and
                              ■   performance measurement benchmarks.



                          Regular Updates
                          The investor’s objectives and constraints should be maintained and reviewed period-
                          ically to reflect any changes in the client’s circumstances. Members and candidates
                          should regularly compare client constraints with capital market expectations to arrive
                          at an appropriate asset allocation. Changes in either factor may result in a fundamen-
                          tal change in asset allocation. Annual review is reasonable unless business or other
                          reasons, such as a major change in market conditions, dictate more frequent review.
                          Members and candidates should document attempts to carry out such a review if
                          circumstances prevent it.


                          Suitability Test Policies
                          With the increase in regulatory required suitability tests, members and candidates
                          should encourage their firms to develop related policies and procedures. The proce-
                          dures will differ according to the size of the firm and the scope of the services offered
                          to its clients.
                              The test procedures should require the investment professional to look beyond
                          the potential return of the investment and include the following:
                              ■   an analysis of the impact on the portfolio’s diversification,
                              ■   a comparison of the investment risks with the client’s assessed risk toler-
                                  ance, and
                              ■   the fit of the investment with the required investment strategy.

STANDARD III(C): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                             29
Example 1 (Investment Suitability—Risk Profile):
Caleb Smith, an investment adviser, has two clients: Larry Robertson, 60 years old, and
Gabriel Lanai, 40 years old. Both clients earn roughly the same salary, but Robertson
has a much higher risk tolerance because he has a large asset base. Robertson is willing
to invest part of his assets very aggressively; Lanai wants only to achieve a steady rate
of return with low volatility to pay for his children’s education. Smith recommends
investing 20% of both portfolios in zero-yield, small-cap, high-technology equity issues.
       Comment: In Robertson’s case, the investment may be appropriate because
       of his financial circumstances and aggressive investment position, but this
       investment is not suitable for Lanai. Smith is violating Standard III(C) by
       applying Robertson’s investment strategy to Lanai because the two clients’
       financial circumstances and objectives differ.



Example 2 (Investment Suitability—Entire Portfolio):
Jessica McDowell, an investment adviser, suggests to Brian Crosby, a risk-averse
client, that covered call options be used in his equity portfolio. The purpose would
be to enhance Crosby’s income and partially offset any untimely depreciation in the
portfolio’s value should the stock market or other circumstances affect his holdings
unfavorably. McDowell educates Crosby about all possible outcomes, including the
risk of incurring an added tax liability if a stock rises in price and is called away and,
conversely, the risk of his holdings losing protection on the downside if prices drop
sharply.
       Comment: When determining suitability of an investment, the primary
       focus should be the characteristics of the client’s entire portfolio, not the
       characteristics of single securities on an issue-by-issue basis. The basic
       characteristics of the entire portfolio will largely determine whether invest-
       ment recommendations are taking client factors into account. Therefore,
       the most important aspects of a particular investment are those that will
       affect the characteristics of the total portfolio. In this case, McDowell
       properly considers the investment in the context of the entire portfolio
       and thoroughly explains the investment to the client.



Example 3 (IPS Updating):
In a regular meeting with client Seth Jones, the portfolio managers at Blue Chip
Investment Advisors are careful to allow some time to review his current needs and
circumstances. In doing so, they learn that some significant changes have recently
taken place in his life. A wealthy uncle left Jones an inheritance that increased his net
worth fourfold, to US$1 million.
       Comment: The inheritance has significantly increased Jones’s ability (and
       possibly his willingness) to assume risk and has diminished the average
       yield required to meet his current income needs. Jones’s financial circum-
       stances have definitely changed, so Blue Chip managers must update Jones’s
       investment policy statement to reflect how his investment objectives have
       changed. Accordingly, the Blue Chip portfolio managers should consider

                                 a somewhat higher equity ratio for his portfolio than was called for by the
                                 previous circumstances, and the managers’ specific common stock recom-
                                 mendations might be heavily tilted toward low-yield, growth-oriented issues.



                          Example 4 (Following an Investment Mandate):
                          Louis Perkowski manages a high-income mutual fund. He purchases zero-dividend
                          stock in a financial services company because he believes the stock is undervalued
                          and is in a potential growth industry, which makes it an attractive investment.
                                 Comment: A zero-dividend stock does not seem to fit the mandate of the
                                 fund that Perkowski is managing. Unless Perkowski’s investment fits within
                                 the mandate or is within the realm of allowable investments the fund has
                                 made clear in its disclosures, Perkowski has violated Standard III(C).


                          Example 5 (IPS Requirements and Limitations):
                          Max Gubler, chief investment officer of a property/casualty insurance subsidiary of a
                          large financial conglomerate, wants to improve the diversification of the subsidiary’s
                          investment portfolio and increase its returns. The subsidiary’s investment policy state-
                          ment provides for highly liquid investments, such as large-cap equities and government,
                          supranational, and corporate bonds with a minimum credit rating of AA and maturity
                          of no more than five years. In a recent presentation, a venture capital group offered
                          very attractive prospective returns on some of its private equity funds that provide seed
                          capital to ventures. An exit strategy was already contemplated, but investors would
                          have to observe a minimum three-year lockup period and a subsequent laddered exit
                          option for a maximum of one-third of their shares per year. Gubler does not want to
                          miss this opportunity. After extensive analysis, with the intent to optimize the return
                          on the equity assets within the subsidiary’s current portfolio, he invests 4% in this
                          seed fund, leaving the portfolio’s total equity exposure still well below its upper limit.
                                 Comment: Gubler is violating Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care
                                 as well as Standard III(C). His new investment locks up part of the sub-
                                 sidiary’s assets for at least three years and up to as many as five years and
                                 possibly beyond. The IPS requires investments in highly liquid investments
                                 and describes accepted asset classes; private equity investments with a
                                 lockup period certainly do not qualify. Even without a lockup period, an
                                 asset class with only an occasional, and thus implicitly illiquid, market
                                 may not be suitable for the portfolio. Although an IPS typically describes
                                 objectives and constraints in great detail, the manager must also make
                                 every effort to understand the client’s business and circumstances. Doing
                                 so should enable the manager to recognize, understand, and discuss with
                                 the client other factors that may be or may become material in the invest-
                                 ment management process.



                          Example 6 (Submanager and IPS Reviews):
                          Paul Ostrowski’s investment management business has grown significantly over the
                          past couple of years, and some clients want to diversify internationally. Ostrowski
                          decides to find a submanager to handle the expected international investments. Because
                          this will be his first subadviser, Ostrowski uses the CFA Institute model “request for
                          proposal” to design a questionnaire for his search. By his deadline, he receives seven
                          completed questionnaires from a variety of domestic and international firms trying

to gain his business. Ostrowski reviews all the applications in detail and decides to
select the firm that charges the lowest fees because doing so will have the least impact
on his firm’s bottom line.
       Comment: When selecting an external manager or subadviser, Ostrowski
       needs to ensure that the new manager’s services are appropriate for his
       clients. This due diligence includes comparing the risk profile of the clients
       with the investment strategy of the manager. In basing the decision on the
       fee structure alone, Ostrowski may be violating Standard III(C).
           When clients ask to diversify into international products, it is an
       appropriate time to review and update the clients’ IPSs. Ostrowski’s review

       profiles of the clients or does not represent an appropriate investment.

Example 7 (Investment Suitability—Risk Profile):
Samantha Snead, a portfolio manager for Thomas Investment Counsel, Inc., special-
izes in managing public retirement funds and defined benefit pension plan accounts,
all of which have long-term investment objectives. A year ago, Snead’s employer, in
an attempt to motivate and retain key investment professionals, introduced a bonus
compensation system that rewards portfolio managers on the basis of quarterly per-
formance relative to their peers and to certain benchmark indexes. In an attempt to
improve the short-term performance of her accounts, Snead changes her investment
strategy and purchases several high-beta stocks for client portfolios. These purchases
are seemingly contrary to the clients’ investment policy statements. Following their
purchase, an officer of Griffin Corporation, one of Snead’s pension fund clients, asks
why Griffin Corporation’s portfolio seems to be dominated by high-beta stocks of
companies that often appear among the most actively traded issues. No change in
objective or strategy has been recommended by Snead during the year.
       Comment: Snead violated Standard III(C) by investing the clients’ assets in
       high-beta stocks. These high-risk investments are contrary to the long-term
       risk profile established in the clients’ IPSs. Snead has changed the investment
       strategy of the clients in an attempt to reap short-term rewards offered by
       her firm’s new compensation arrangement, not in response to changes in
       clients’ investment policy statements.

Example 8 (Investment Suitability):
Andre Shrub owns and operates Conduit, an investment advisory firm. Prior to opening
Conduit, Shrub was an account manager with Elite Investment, a hedge fund man-
aged by his good friend Adam Reed. To attract clients to a new Conduit fund, Shrub
offers lower-than-normal management fees. He can do so because the fund consists
of two top-performing funds managed by Reed. Given his personal friendship with
Reed and the prior performance record of these two funds, Shrub believes this new
fund is a winning combination for all parties. Clients quickly invest with Conduit to
gain access to the Elite funds. No one is turned away because Conduit is seeking to
expand its assets under management.

                                 Comment: Shrub has violated Standard III(C) because the risk profile
                                 of the new fund may not be suitable for every client. As an investment
                                 adviser, Shrub needs to establish an investment policy statement for each
                                 client and recommend only investments that match each client’s risk and
                                 return profile in the IPS. Shrub is required to act as more than a simple
                                 sales agent for Elite.
                                     Although Shrub cannot disobey the direct request of a client to purchase
                                 a specific security, he should fully discuss the risks of a planned purchase
                                 and provide reasons why it might not be suitable for a client. This require-
                                 ment may lead members and candidates to decline new customers if those
                                 customers’ requested investment decisions are significantly out of line with
                                 their stated requirements.

                             When communicating investment performance information, Members and
                             Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is fair, accurate, and
                             complete.



                          Guidance
                          Standard III(D) requires members and candidates to provide credible performance
                          information to clients and prospective clients and to avoid misstating performance
                          or misleading clients and prospective clients about the investment performance of
                          members or candidates or their firms. This standard encourages full disclosure of
                          investment performance data to clients and prospective clients.
                              Standard III(D) covers any practice that would lead to misrepresentation of a mem-
                          ber’s or candidate’s performance record, whether the practice involves performance
                          presentation or performance measurement. This standard prohibits misrepresentations
                          of past performance or reasonably expected performance. A member or candidate
                          must give a fair and complete presentation of performance information whenever
                          communicating data with respect to the performance history of individual accounts,
                          composites or groups of accounts, or composites of an analyst’s or firm’s performance
                          results. Furthermore, members and candidates should not state or imply that clients
                          will obtain or benefit from a rate of return that was generated in the past.

    The requirements of this standard are not limited to members and candidates
managing separate accounts. Whenever a member or candidate provides performance
information for which the manager is claiming responsibility, such as for pooled funds,
the history must be accurate. Research analysts promoting the success or accuracy of
their recommendations must ensure that their claims are fair, accurate, and complete.
    If the presentation is brief, the member or candidate must make available to clients
and prospects, on request, the detailed information supporting that communication.
Best practice dictates that brief presentations include a reference to the limited nature
of the information provided.




STANDARD III(D): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                                                                                            31
Apply the GIPS Standards
For members and candidates who are showing the performance history of the assets
they manage, compliance with the GIPS standards is the best method to meet their
obligations under Standard III(D). Members and candidates should encourage their
firms to comply with the GIPS standards.


Compliance without Applying GIPS Standards
Members and candidates can also meet their obligations under Standard III(D) by
   ■   considering the knowledge and sophistication of the audience to whom a
       performance presentation is addressed,
   ■   presenting the performance of the weighted composite of similar portfolios
       rather than using a single representative account,
   ■   including terminated accounts as part of performance history with a clear
       indication of when the accounts were terminated,
   ■   including disclosures that fully explain the performance results being
       reported (for example, stating, when appropriate, that results are simulated
       when model results are used, clearly indicating when the performance
       record is that of a prior entity, or disclosing whether the performance is
       gross of fees, net of fees, or after tax), and
   ■   maintaining the data and records used to calculate the performance being
       presented.




STANDARD III(D): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                            32
Example 1 (Performance Calculation and Length of Time):
Kyle Taylor of Taylor Trust Company, noting the performance of Taylor’s common
trust fund for the past two years, states in a brochure sent to his potential clients,
“You can expect steady 25% annual compound growth of the value of your investments
over the year.” Taylor Trust’s common trust fund did increase at the rate of 25% per
                          © CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.

                          year for the past year, which mirrored the increase of the entire market. The fund has
                          never averaged that growth for more than one year, however, and the average rate of
                          growth of all of its trust accounts for five years is 5% per year.
                                 Comment: Taylor’s brochure is in violation of Standard III(D). Taylor should
                                 have disclosed that the 25% growth occurred only in one year. Additionally,
                                 Taylor did not include client accounts other than those in the firm’s common
                                 trust fund. A general claim of firm performance should take into account
                                 the performance of all categories of accounts. Finally, by stating that cli-
                                 ents can expect a steady 25% annual compound growth rate, Taylor is also
                                 violating Standard I(C) Misrepresentation, which prohibits assurances or
                                 guarantees regarding an investment.



                          Example 2 (Performance Calculation and Asset Weighting):
                          Anna Judd, a senior partner of Alexander Capital Management, circulates a perfor-
                          mance report for the capital appreciation accounts for the years 1988 through 2004.
                          The firm claims compliance with the GIPS standards. Returns are not calculated in
                          accordance with the requirements of the GIPS standards, however, because the com-
                          posites are not asset weighted.
                                 Comment: Judd is in violation of Standard III(D). When claiming compli-
                                 ance with the GIPS standards, firms must meet all of the requirements,
                                 make mandatory disclosures, and meet any other requirements that apply
                                 to that firm’s specific situation. Judd’s violation is not from any misuse of
                                 the data but from a false claim of GIPS compliance.


                          Example 3 (Performance Presentation and Prior Fund/
                          Employer):
                          Aaron McCoy is vice president and managing partner of the equity investment group
                          of Mastermind Financial Advisors, a new business. Mastermind recruited McCoy
                          because he had a proven six-year track record with G&P Financial. In developing
                          Mastermind’s advertising and marketing campaign, McCoy prepares an advertisement
                          that includes the equity investment performance he achieved at G&P Financial. The
                          advertisement for Mastermind does not identify the equity performance as being
                          earned while at G&P. The advertisement is distributed to existing clients and pro-
                          spective clients of Mastermind.
                                 Comment: McCoy has violated Standard III(D) by distributing an adver-
                                 tisement that contains material misrepresentations about the historical
                                 performance of Mastermind. Standard III(D) requires that members and
                                 candidates make every reasonable effort to ensure that performance infor-
                                 mation is a fair, accurate, and complete representation of an individual’s
                                 or firm’s performance. As a general matter, this standard does not prohibit
                                 showing past performance of funds managed at a prior firm as part of a
                                 performance track record as long as showing that record is accompanied
                                 by appropriate disclosures about where the performance took place and
                                 the person’s specific role in achieving that performance. If McCoy chooses
                                 to use his past performance from G&P in Mastermind’s advertising, he
                                 should make full disclosure of the source of the historical performance.

Example 4 (Performance Presentation and Simulated Results):
Jed Davis has developed a mutual fund selection product based on historical informa-
tion from the 1990–95 period. Davis tested his methodology by applying it retroactively
to data from the 1996–2003 period, thus producing simulated performance results for
those years. In January 2004, Davis’s employer decided to offer the product and Davis
began promoting it through trade journal advertisements and direct dissemination
to clients. The advertisements included the performance results for the 1996–2003
period but did not indicate that the results were simulated.
       Comment: Davis violated Standard III(D) by failing to clearly identify
       simulated performance results. Standard III(D) prohibits members and
       candidates from making any statements that misrepresent the performance
       achieved by them or their firms and requires members and candidates
       to make every reasonable effort to ensure that performance information
       presented to clients is fair, accurate, and complete. Use of simulated results
       should be accompanied by full disclosure as to the source of the performance
       data, including the fact that the results from 1995 through 2003 were the
       result of applying the model retroactively to that time period.



Example 5 (Performance Calculation and Selected Accounts
Only):
In a presentation prepared for prospective clients, William Kilmer shows the rates
of return realized over a five-year period by a “composite” of his firm’s discretionary
accounts that have a “balanced” objective. This composite, however, consisted of only a
few of the accounts that met the balanced criterion set by the firm, excluded accounts
under a certain asset level without disclosing the fact of their exclusion, and included
accounts that did not have the balanced mandate because those accounts would boost
the investment results. In addition, to achieve better results, Kilmer manipulated the
narrow range of accounts included in the composite by changing the accounts that
made up the composite over time.
       Comment: Kilmer violated Standard III(D) by misrepresenting the facts in
       the promotional material sent to prospective clients, distorting his firm’s
       performance record, and failing to include disclosures that would have
       clarified the presentation.



Example 6 (Performance Attribution Changes):
Art Purell is reviewing the quarterly performance attribution reports for distribu-
tion to clients. Purell works for an investment management firm with a bottom-up,
fundamentals-driven investment process that seeks to add value through stock selec-
tion. The attribution methodology currently compares each stock with its sector. The
attribution report indicates that the value added this quarter came from asset allocation
and that stock selection contributed negatively to the calculated return.
    Through running several different scenarios, Purell discovers that calculating
attribution by comparing each stock with its industry and then rolling the effect to
the sector level improves the appearance of the manager’s stock selection activities.
Because the firm defines the attribution terms and the results better reflect the stated
strategy, Purell recommends that the client reports should use the revised methodology.

                                 Comment: Modifying the attribution methodology without proper notifi-
                                 cations to clients would fail to meet the requirements of Standard III(D).
                                 Purrell’s recommendation is being done solely for the interest of the firm
                                 to improve its perceived ability to meet the stated investment strategy.
                                 Such changes are unfair to clients and obscure the facts regarding the
                                 firm’s abilities.
                                     Had Purell believed the new methodology offered improvements to the
                                 original model, then he would have needed to report the results of both
                                 calculations to the client. The report should also include the reasons why
                                 the new methodology is preferred, which would allow the client to make a
                                 meaningful comparison to prior results and provide a basis for comparing
                                 future attributions.



                          Example 7 (Performance Calculation Methodology Disclosure):
                          While developing a new reporting package for existing clients, Alisha Singh, a perfor-
                          mance analyst, discovers that her company’s new system automatically calculates both
                          time-weighted and money-weighted returns. She asks the head of client services and
                          retention which value would be preferred given that the firm has various investment
                          strategies that include bonds, equities, securities without leverage, and alternatives.
                          Singh is told not to label the return value so that the firm may show whichever value
                          is greatest for the period.
                                 Comment: Following these instructions would lead to Singh violating
                                 Standard III(D). In reporting inconsistent return values, Singh would not
                                 be providing complete information to the firm’s clients. Full information is
                                 provided when clients have sufficient information to judge the performance
                                 generated by the firm.



                          Example 8 (Performance Calculation Methodology Disclosure):
                          Richmond Equity Investors manages a long–short equity fund in which clients can trade
                          once a week (on Fridays). For transparency reasons, a daily net asset value of the fund
                          is calculated by Richmond. The monthly fact sheets of the fund report month-to-date
                          and year-to-date performance. Richmond publishes the performance based on the
                          higher of the last trading day of the month (typically, not the last business day) or the
                          last business day of the month as determined by Richmond. The fact sheet mentions
                          only that the data are as of the end of the month, without giving the exact date. Maggie
                          Clark, the investment performance analyst in charge of the calculations, is concerned
                          about the frequent changes and asks her supervisor whether they are appropriate.
                                 Comment: Clark’s actions in questioning the changing performance metric
                                 comply with Standard III(D). She has shown concern that these changes
                                 are not presenting an accurate and complete picture of the performance
                                 generated.

Standard III(E) requires that members and candidates preserve the confidentiality of
information communicated to them by their clients, prospective clients, and former
clients. This standard is applicable when (1) the member or candidate receives infor-
mation because of his or her special ability to conduct a portion of the client’s business
or personal affairs and (2) the member or candidate receives information that arises
from or is relevant to that portion of the client’s business that is the subject of the
special or confidential relationship. If disclosure of the information is required by law
or the information concerns illegal activities by the client, however, the member or
candidate may have an obligation to report the activities to the appropriate authorities.

Status of Client
This standard protects the confidentiality of client information even if the person
or entity is no longer a client of the member or candidate. Therefore, members and
candidates must continue to maintain the confidentiality of client records even after
the client relationship has ended. If a client or former client expressly authorizes the
member or candidate to disclose information, however, the member or candidate may
follow the terms of the authorization and provide the information.

                          Compliance with Laws
                          As a general matter, members and candidates must comply with applicable law. If appli-
                          cable law requires disclosure of client information in certain circumstances, members
                          and candidates must comply with the law. Similarly, if applicable law requires members
                          and candidates to maintain confidentiality, even if the information concerns illegal
                          activities on the part of the client, members and candidates should not disclose such
                          information. Additionally, applicable laws, such as inter-departmental communication
                          restrictions within financial institutions, can impose limitations on information flow
                          about a client within an entity that may lead to a violation of confidentiality. When
                          in doubt, members and candidates should consult with their employer’s compliance
                          personnel or legal counsel before disclosing confidential information about clients.

                          Electronic Information and Security
                          Because of the ever-increasing volume of electronically stored information, members
                          and candidates need to be particularly aware of possible accidental disclosures. Many
                          employers have strict policies about how to electronically communicate sensitive
                          client information and store client information on personal laptops, mobile devices,
                          or portable disk/flash drives. In recent years, regulatory authorities have imposed
                          stricter data security laws applying to the use of mobile remote digital communication,
                          including the use of social media, that must be considered. Standard III(E) does not
                          require members or candidates to become experts in information security technology,
                          but they should have a thorough understanding of the policies of their employer. The
                          size and operations of the firm will lead to differing policies for ensuring the security of
                          confidential information maintained within the firm. Members and candidates should
                          encourage their firm to conduct regular periodic training on confidentiality proce-
                          dures for all firm personnel, including portfolio associates, receptionists, and other
                          non-investment staff who have routine direct contact with clients and their records.

                          Professional Conduct Investigations by CFA Institute
                          The requirements of Standard III(E) are not intended to prevent members and can-
                          didates from cooperating with an investigation by the CFA Institute Professional
                          Conduct Program (PCP). When permissible under applicable law, members and
                          candidates shall consider the PCP an extension of themselves when requested to
                          provide information about a client in support of a PCP investigation into their own
                          conduct. Members and candidates are encouraged to cooperate with investigations
                          into the conduct of others. Any information turned over to the PCP is kept in the
                          strictest confidence. Members and candidates will not be considered in violation of
                          this standard by forwarding confidential information to the PCP.




            34            STANDARD III(E): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                          The simplest, most conservative, and most effective way to comply with Standard
                          III(E) is to avoid disclosing any information received from a client except to authorized
                          fellow employees who are also working for the client. In some instances, however, a
                          member or candidate may want to disclose information received from clients that is
                          outside the scope of the confidential relationship and does not involve illegal activities.
                          Before making such a disclosure, a member or candidate should ask the following:
                              ■   In what context was the information disclosed? If disclosed in a discussion
                                  of work being performed for the client, is the information relevant to the
                                  work?

   ■   Is the information background material that, if disclosed, will enable the
       member or candidate to improve service to the client?
    Members and candidates need to understand and follow their firm’s electronic infor-
mation communication and storage procedures. If the firm does not have procedures
in place, members and candidates should encourage the development of procedures
that appropriately reflect the firm’s size and business operations.


Communicating with Clients
Technological changes are constantly enhancing the methods that are used to com-
municate with clients and prospective clients. Members and candidates should make
reasonable efforts to ensure that firm-supported communication methods and com-
pliance procedures follow practices designed for preventing accidental distribution
of confidential information. Given the rate at which technology changes, a regular
review of privacy protection measures is encouraged.
    Members and candidates should be diligent in discussing with clients the appropri-
ate methods for providing confidential information. It is important to convey to clients
that not all firm-sponsored resources may be appropriate for such communications.




STANDARD III(E): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                           35
Example 1 (Possessing Confidential Information):
Sarah Connor, a financial analyst employed by Johnson Investment Counselors, Inc.,
provides investment advice to the trustees of City Medical Center. The trustees have
given her a number of internal reports concerning City Medical’s needs for physical
plant renovation and expansion. They have asked Connor to recommend investments
that would generate capital appreciation in endowment funds to meet projected capital
expenditures. Connor is approached by a local businessman, Thomas Kasey, who is
considering a substantial contribution either to City Medical Center or to another
local hospital. Kasey wants to find out the building plans of both institutions before
making a decision, but he does not want to speak to the trustees.
       Comment: The trustees gave Connor the internal reports so she could
       advise them on how to manage their endowment funds. Because the infor-
       mation in the reports is clearly both confidential and within the scope of
       the confidential relationship, Standard III(E) requires that Connor refuse
       to divulge information to Kasey.



Example 2 (Disclosing Confidential Information):
Lynn Moody is an investment officer at the Lester Trust Company. She has an advisory
customer who has talked to her about giving approximately US$50,000 to charity to
reduce her income taxes. Moody is also treasurer of the Home for Indigent Widows
(HIW), which is planning its annual giving campaign. HIW hopes to expand its list
of prospects, particularly those capable of substantial gifts. Moody recommends that
HIW’s vice president for corporate gifts call on her customer and ask for a donation
in the US$50,000 range.

                                 Comment: Even though the attempt to help the Home for Indigent Widows
                                 was well intended, Moody violated Standard III(E) by revealing confidential
                                 information about her client.



                          Example 3 (Disclosing Possible Illegal Activity):
                          Government officials approach Casey Samuel, the portfolio manager for Garcia
                          Company’s pension plan, to examine pension fund records. They tell her that Garcia’s
                          corporate tax returns are being audited and the pension fund is being reviewed. Two
                          days earlier, Samuel had learned in a regular investment review with Garcia officers
                          that potentially excessive and improper charges were being made to the pension plan
                          by Garcia. Samuel consults her employer’s general counsel and is advised that Garcia
                          has probably violated tax and fiduciary regulations and laws.
                                 Comment: Samuel should inform her supervisor of these activities, and her
                                 employer should take steps, with Garcia, to remedy the violations. If that
                                 approach is not successful, Samuel and her employer should seek advice of
                                 legal counsel to determine the appropriate steps to be taken. Samuel may
                                 well have a duty to disclose the evidence she has of the continuing legal
                                 violations and to resign as asset manager for Garcia.



                          Example 4 (Disclosing Possible Illegal Activity):
                          David Bradford manages money for a family-owned real estate development corpora-
                          tion. He also manages the individual portfolios of several of the family members and
                          officers of the corporation, including the chief financial officer (CFO). Based on the
                          financial records of the corporation and some questionable practices of the CFO that
                          Bradford has observed, Bradford believes that the CFO is embezzling money from
                          the corporation and putting it into his personal investment account.
                                 Comment: Bradford should check with his firm’s compliance department
                                 or appropriate legal counsel to determine whether applicable securities
                                 regulations require reporting the CFO’s financial records.


                          Example 5 (Accidental Disclosure of Confidential Information):
                          Lynn Moody is an investment officer at the Lester Trust Company (LTC). She has
                          stewardship of a significant number of individually managed taxable accounts. In
                          addition to receiving quarterly written reports, about a dozen high-net-worth individ-
                          uals have indicated to Moody a willingness to receive communications about overall
                          economic and financial market outlooks directly from her by way of a social media
                          platform. Under the direction of her firm’s technology and compliance departments,
                          she established a new group page on an existing social media platform specifically
                          for her clients. In the instructions provided to clients, Moody asked them to “join”
                          the group so they may be granted access to the posted content. The instructions also
                          advised clients that all comments posted would be available to the public and thus the
                          platform was not an appropriate method for communicating personal or confidential
                          information.
                              Six months later, in early January, Moody posted LTC’s year-end “Market Outlook.”
                          The report outlined a new asset allocation strategy that the firm is adding to its recom-
                          mendations in the new year. Moody introduced the publication with a note informing
                          her clients that she would be discussing the changes with them individually in their
                          upcoming meetings.

    One of Moody’s clients responded directly on the group page that his family
recently experienced a major change in their financial profile. The client described
highly personal and confidential details of the event. Unfortunately, all clients that
were part of the group were also able to read the detailed posting until Moody was
able to have the comment removed.
       Comment: Moody has taken reasonable steps for protecting the confiden-
       tiality of client information while using the social media platform. She
       provided instructions clarifying that all information posted to the site
       would be publicly viewable to all group members and warned against using
       this method for communicating confidential information. The accidental
       disclosure of confidential information by a client is not under Moody’s
       control. Her actions to remove the information promptly once she became
       aware further align with Standard III(E).
            In understanding the potential sensitivity clients express surrounding
       the confidentiality of personal information, this event highlights a need
       for further training. Moody might advocate for additional warnings or
       controls for clients when they consider using social media platforms for
       two-way communications.

                          Standard IV(A) requires members and candidates to protect the interests of their
                          firm by refraining from any conduct that would injure the firm, deprive it of profit, or
                          deprive it of the member’s or candidate’s skills and ability. Members and candidates
                          must always place the interests of clients above the interests of their employer but
                          should also consider the effects of their conduct on the sustainability and integrity of
                          the employer firm. In matters related to their employment, members and candidates
                          must not engage in conduct that harms the interests of their employer. Implicit in
                          this standard is the obligation of members and candidates to comply with the policies
                          and procedures established by their employers that govern the employer–employee
                          relationship—to the extent that such policies and procedures do not conflict with
                          applicable laws, rules, or regulations or the Code and Standards.
                              This standard is not meant to be a blanket requirement to place employer interests
                          ahead of personal interests in all matters. The standard does not require members and
                          candidates to subordinate important personal and family obligations to their work.
                          Members and candidates should enter into a dialogue with their employer about
                          balancing personal and employment obligations when personal matters may interfere
                          with their work on a regular or significant basis.

                          Employer Responsibilities
                          The employer–employee relationship imposes duties and responsibilities on both
                          parties. Employers must recognize the duties and responsibilities that they owe to
                          their employees if they expect to have content and productive employees.
                              Members and candidates are encouraged to provide their employer with a copy
                          of the Code and Standards. These materials will inform the employer of the respon-
                          sibilities of a CFA Institute member or a candidate in the CFA Program. The Code
                          and Standards also serve as a basis for questioning employer policies and practices
                          that conflict with these responsibilities.
                              Employers are not obligated to adhere to the Code and Standards. In expecting
                          to retain competent employees who are members and candidates, however, they
                          should not develop conflicting policies and procedures. The employer is responsible
                          for a positive working environment, which includes an ethical workplace. Senior
                          management has the additional responsibility to devise compensation structures and
                          incentive arrangements that do not encourage unethical behavior.

                          Independent Practice
                          Included in Standard IV(A) is the requirement that members and candidates abstain
                          from independent competitive activity that could conflict with the interests of their
                          employer. Although Standard IV(A) does not preclude members or candidates from
                          entering into an independent business while still employed, members and candidates
                          who plan to engage in independent practice for compensation must notify their
                          employer and describe the types of services they will render to prospective independent
                          clients, the expected duration of the services, and the compensation for the services.
                          Members and candidates should not render services until they receive consent from
                          their employer to all of the terms of the arrangement. “Practice” means any service that
                          the employer currently makes available for remuneration. “Undertaking independent
                          practice” means engaging in competitive business, as opposed to making preparations
                          to begin such practice.

Standard IV: Duties to Employers                                                            149


Leaving an Employer
When members and candidates are planning to leave their current employer, they
must continue to act in the employer’s best interest. They must not engage in any
activities that would conflict with this duty until their resignation becomes effective.
It is difficult to define specific guidelines for those members and candidates who are
planning to compete with their employer as part of a new venture. The circumstances
of each situation must be reviewed to distinguish permissible preparations from vio-
lations of duty. Activities that might constitute a violation, especially in combination,
include the following:
   ■   misappropriation of trade secrets,
   ■   misuse of confidential information,
   ■   solicitation of the employer’s clients prior to cessation of employment,
   ■   self-dealing (appropriating for one’s own property a business opportunity or
       information belonging to one’s employer), and
   ■   misappropriation of clients or client lists.
    A departing employee is generally free to make arrangements or preparations to
go into a competitive business before terminating the relationship with his or her
employer as long as such preparations do not breach the employee’s duty of loyalty.
A member or candidate who is contemplating seeking other employment must not
contact existing clients or potential clients prior to leaving his or her employer for
purposes of soliciting their business for the new employer. Once notice is provided
to the employer of the intent to resign, the member or candidate must follow the
employer’s policies and procedures related to notifying clients of his or her planned
departure. In addition, the member or candidate must not take records or files to a
new employer without the written permission of the previous employer.
    Once an employee has left the firm, the skills and experience that an employee
obtained while employed are not “confidential” or “privileged” information. Similarly,
simple knowledge of the names and existence of former clients is generally not con-
fidential information unless deemed such by an agreement or by law. Standard IV(A)
does not prohibit experience or knowledge gained at one employer from being used
at another employer. Firm records or work performed on behalf of the firm that is
stored in paper copy or electronically for the member’s or candidate’s convenience
while employed, however, should be erased or returned to the employer unless the
firm gives permission to keep those records after employment ends.
    The standard does not prohibit former employees from contacting clients of their
previous firm as long as the contact information does not come from the records of
the former employer or violate an applicable “noncompete agreement.” Members and
candidates are free to use public information after departing to contact former clients
without violating Standard IV(A) as long as there is no specific agreement not to do so.
    Employers often require employees to sign noncompete agreements that preclude a
departing employee from engaging in certain conduct. Members and candidates should
take care to review the terms of any such agreement when leaving their employer to
determine what, if any, conduct those agreements may prohibit.
    In some markets, there are agreements between employers within an industry that
outline information that departing employees are permitted to take upon resignation,
such as the “Protocol for Broker Recruiting” in the United States. These agreements
ease individuals’ transition between firms that have agreed to follow the outlined
procedures. Members and candidates who move between firms that sign such agree-
ments may rely on the protections provided as long as they faithfully adhere to all
the procedures outlined.

                              For example, under the agreement between many US brokers, individuals are
                          allowed to take some general client contact information when departing. To be pro-
                          tected, a copy of the information the individual is taking must be provided to the
                          local management team for review. Additionally, the specific client information may
                          only be used by the departing employee and not others employed by the new firm.

                          Use of Social Media
                          The growth in various online networking platforms, such as LinkedIn, X, and Facebook
                          (commonly referred to as social media platforms), is providing new opportunities and
                          challenges for businesses. Members and candidates should understand and abide by
                          all applicable firm policies and regulations as to the acceptable use of social media
                          platforms to interact with clients and prospective clients. This is especially important
                          when a member or candidate is planning to leave an employer.
                              Social media use makes determining how and when departure notification is deliv-
                          ered to clients more complex. Members and candidates may have developed profiles
                          on these platforms that include connections with individuals who are clients of the
                          firm, as well as individuals unrelated to their employer. Communications through
                          social media platforms that potentially reach current clients should adhere to the
                          employer’s policies and procedures regarding notification of departing employees.
                              Social media connections with clients are also raising questions concerning the
                          differences between public information and firm property. Specific accounts and
                          user profiles of members and candidates may be created for solely professional rea-
                          sons, including firm-approved accounts for client engagements. Such firm-approved
                          business-related accounts would be considered part of the firm’s assets, thus requiring
                          members and candidates to transfer or delete the accounts as directed by their firm’s
                          policies and procedures. Best practice for members and candidates is to maintain
                          separate accounts for their personal and professional social media activities. Members
                          and candidates should discuss with their employers how profiles should be treated
                          when a single account includes personal connections and also is used to conduct
                          aspects of their professional activities.

                          Whistleblowing
                          A member’s or candidate’s personal interests, as well as the interests of his or her
                          employer, are secondary to protecting the integrity of capital markets and the interests
                          of clients. Therefore, circumstances may arise (e.g., when an employer is engaged in
                          illegal or unethical activity) in which members and candidates must act contrary to
                          their employer’s interests in order to comply with their duties to the market and clients.
                          In such instances, activities that would normally violate a member’s or candidate’s
                          duty to his or her employer (such as contradicting employer instructions, violating
                          certain policies and procedures, or preserving a record by copying employer records)
                          may be justified. Such action would be permitted only if the intent is clearly aimed at
                          protecting clients or the integrity of the market, not for personal gain.

                          Nature of Employment
                          A wide variety of business relationships exists within the investment industry. For
                          instance, a member or candidate may be an employee or an independent contractor.
                          Members and candidates must determine whether they are employees or independent
                          contractors in order to determine the applicability of Standard IV(A). This issue will
                          be decided largely by the degree of control exercised by the employing entity over the
                          member or candidate. Factors determining control include whether the member’s or
                          candidate’s hours, work location, and other parameters of the job are set; whether
                          facilities are provided to the member or candidate; whether the member’s or candidate’s
                          expenses are reimbursed; whether the member or candidate seeks work from other
                          employers; and the number of clients or employers the member or candidate works for.

Standard IV(A): Recommended Procedures                                                         151


    A member’s or candidate’s duties within an independent contractor relationship
are governed by the oral or written agreement between the member and the client.
Members and candidates should take care to define clearly the scope of their respon-
sibilities and the expectations of each client within the context of each relationship.
Once a member or candidate establishes a relationship with a client, the member or
candidate has a duty to abide by the terms of the agreement.




STANDARD IV(A): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
Employers may establish codes of conduct and operating procedures for their employees
                                                                                          37
to follow. Members and candidates should fully understand the policies to ensure that
they are not in conflict with the Code and Standards. The following topics identify
policies that members and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt if the
policies are not currently in place.


Competition Policy
A member or candidate must understand any restrictions placed by the employer
on offering similar services outside the firm while employed by the firm. The policy
may outline the procedures for requesting approval to undertake the outside service
or may be a strict prohibition of such service. If a member’s or candidate’s employer
elects to have its employees sign a noncompete agreement as part of the employment
agreement, the member or candidate should ensure that the details are clear and fully
explained prior to signing the agreement.


Termination Policy
Members and candidates should clearly understand the termination policies of their
employer. Termination policies should establish clear procedures regarding the
resignation process, including addressing how the termination will be disclosed to
clients and staff and whether updates posted through social media platforms will be
allowed. The firm’s policy may also outline the procedures for transferring ongoing
research and account management responsibilities. Finally, the procedures should
address agreements that allow departing employees to remove specific client-related
information upon resignation.


Incident-Reporting Procedures
Members and candidates should be aware of their firm’s policies related to whis-
tleblowing and encourage their firm to adopt industry best practices in this area. Many
firms are required by regulatory mandates to establish confidential and anonymous
reporting procedures that allow employees to report potentially unethical and illegal
activities in the firm.


Employee Classification
Members and candidates should understand their status within their employer firm.
Firms are encouraged to adopt a standardized classification structure (e.g., part time,
full time, outside contractor) for their employees and indicate how each of the firm’s
policies applies to each employee class.

            38            STANDARD IV(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                          Example 1 (Soliciting Former Clients):
                          Samuel Magee manages pension accounts for Trust Assets, Inc., but has become frus-
                          trated with the working environment and has been offered a position with Fiduciary
                          Management. Before resigning from Trust Assets, Magee asks four big accounts to
                          leave that firm and open accounts with Fiduciary. Magee also persuades several pro-
                          spective clients to sign agreements with Fiduciary Management. Magee had previously
                          made presentations to these prospects on behalf of Trust Assets.
                                 Comment: Magee violated the employee–employer principle requiring
                                 him to act solely for his employer’s benefit. Magee’s duty is to Trust Assets
                                 as long as he is employed there. The solicitation of Trust Assets’ current
                                 clients and prospective clients is unethical and violates Standard IV(A).



                          Example 2 (Former Employer’s Documents and Files):
                          James Hightower has been employed by Jason Investment Management Corporation
                          for 15 years. He began as an analyst but assumed increasing responsibilities and is
                          now a senior portfolio manager and a member of the firm’s investment policy com-
                          mittee. Hightower has decided to leave Jason Investment and start his own investment
                          management business. He has been careful not to tell any of Jason’s clients that he is
                          leaving; he does not want to be accused of breaching his duty to Jason by soliciting
                          Jason’s clients before his departure. Hightower is planning to copy and take with him
                          the following documents and information he developed or worked on while at Jason:
                          (1) the client list, with addresses, telephone numbers, and other pertinent client
                          information; (2) client account statements; (3) sample marketing presentations to
                          prospective clients containing Jason’s performance record; (4) Jason’s recommended
                          list of securities; (5) computer models to determine asset allocations for accounts
                          with various objectives; (6) computer models for stock selection; and (7) personal
                          computer spreadsheets for Hightower’s major corporate recommendations, which
                          he developed when he was an analyst.
                                 Comment: Except with the consent of their employer, departing members
                                 and candidates may not take employer property, which includes books,
                                 records, reports, and other materials, because taking such materials may
                                 interfere with their employer’s business opportunities. Taking any employer
                                 records, even those the member or candidate prepared, violates Standard
                                 IV(A). Employer records include items stored in hard copy or any other
                                 medium (e.g., home computers, portable storage devices, cell phones).



                          Example 3 (Addressing Rumors):
                          Reuben Winston manages all-equity portfolios at Target Asset Management (TAM),
                          a large, established investment counselor. Ten years previously, Philpott & Company,
                          which manages a family of global bond mutual funds, acquired TAM in a diversifica-
                          tion move. After the merger, the combined operations prospered in the fixed-income
                          business but the equity management business at TAM languished. Lately, a few of the
                          equity pension accounts that had been with TAM before the merger have terminated
                          their relationships with TAM. One day, Winston finds on his voice mail the following
                          message from a concerned client: “Hey! I just heard that Philpott is close to announcing

Standard IV(A): Application of the Standard                                               153


the sale of your firm’s equity management business to Rugged Life. What is going
on?” Not being aware of any such deal, Winston and his associates are stunned. Their
internal inquiries are met with denials from Philpott management, but the rumors
persist. Feeling left in the dark, Winston contemplates leading an employee buyout
of TAM’s equity management business.
       Comment: An employee-led buyout of TAM’s equity asset management
       business would be consistent with Standard IV(A) because it would rest
       on the permission of the employer and, ultimately, the clients. In this case,
       however, in which employees suspect the senior managers or principals
       are not truthful or forthcoming, Winston should consult legal counsel to
       determine appropriate action.



Example 4 (Ownership of Completed Prior Work):
Laura Clay, who is unemployed, wants part-time consulting work while seeking a
full-time analyst position. During an interview at Bradley Associates, a large institu-
tional asset manager, Clay is told that the firm has no immediate research openings
but would be willing to pay her a flat fee to complete a study of the wireless commu-
nications industry within a given period of time. Clay would be allowed unlimited
access to Bradley’s research files and would be welcome to come to the offices and
use whatever support facilities are available during normal working hours. Bradley’s
research director does not seek any exclusivity for Clay’s output, and the two agree
to the arrangement on a handshake. As Clay nears completion of the study, she is
offered an analyst job in the research department of Winston & Company, a brokerage
firm, and she is pondering submitting the draft of her wireless study for publication
by Winston.
       Comment: Although she is under no written contractual obligation to
       Bradley, Clay has an obligation to let Bradley act on the output of her study
       before Winston & Company or Clay uses the information to their advantage.
       That is, unless Bradley gives permission to Clay and waives its rights to her
       wireless report, Clay would be in violation of Standard IV(A) if she were to
       immediately recommend to Winston the same transactions recommended
       in the report to Bradley. Furthermore, Clay must not take from Bradley any
       research file material or other property that she may have used.


Example 5 (Ownership of Completed Prior Work):
Emma Madeline, a recent college graduate and a candidate in the CFA Program,
spends her summer as an unpaid intern at Murdoch and Lowell. The senior managers
at Murdoch are attempting to bring the firm into compliance with the GIPS standards,
and Madeline is assigned to assist in its efforts. Two months into her internship,
Madeline applies for a job at McMillan & Company, which has plans to become GIPS
compliant. Madeline accepts the job with McMillan. Before leaving Murdoch, she
copies the firm’s software that she helped develop because she believes this software
will assist her in her new position.
       Comment: Even though Madeline does not receive monetary compensation
       for her services at Murdoch, she has used firm resources in creating the
       software and is considered an employee because she receives compensation
       and benefits in the form of work experience and knowledge. By copying the
       software, Madeline violated Standard IV(A) because she misappropriated
       Murdoch’s property without permission.

                          Chisolm left his former firm after 18 years of employment. When Chisolm begins
                          working for Elliot, he wants to contact his former clients because he knows them well
                          and is certain that many will follow him to his new employer. Is Chisolm in violation
                          of Standard IV(A) if he contacts his former clients?
                                 Comment: Because client records are the property of the firm, contact-
                                 ing former clients for any reason through the use of client lists or other
                                 information taken from a former employer without permission would be a
                                 violation of Standard IV(A). In addition, the nature and extent of the con-
                                 tact with former clients may be governed by the terms of any noncompete
                                 agreement signed by the employee and the former employer that covers
                                 contact with former clients after employment.
                                     Simple knowledge of the names and existence of former clients is not
                                 confidential information, just as skills or experience that an employee
                                 obtains while employed are not “confidential” or “privileged” information.
                                 The Code and Standards do not impose a prohibition on the use of expe-
                                 rience or knowledge gained at one employer from being used at another
                                 employer. The Code and Standards also do not prohibit former employees
                                 from contacting clients of their previous firm, in the absence of a noncom-
                                 pete agreement. Members and candidates are free to use public information
                                 about their former firm after departing to contact former clients without
                                 violating Standard IV(A).
                                     In the absence of a noncompete agreement, as long as Chisolm main-
                                 tains his duty of loyalty to his employer before joining Elliot’s firm, does
                                 not take steps to solicit clients until he has left his former firm, and does
                                 not use material from his former employer without its permission after he
                                 has left, he is not in violation of the Code and Standards.



                          Example 7 (Starting a New Firm):
                          Geraldine Allen currently works at a registered investment company as an equity
                          analyst. Without notice to her employer, she registers with government authorities to
                          start an investment company that will compete with her employer, but she does not
                          actively seek clients. Does registration of this competing company with the appropriate
                          regulatory authorities constitute a violation of Standard IV(A)?
                                 Comment: Allen’s preparation for the new business by registering with the
                                 regulatory authorities does not conflict with the work for her employer if
                                 the preparations have been done on Allen’s own time outside the office and
                                 if Allen will not be soliciting clients for the business or otherwise operating
                                 the new company until she has left her current employer.



                          Example 8 (Competing with Current Employer):
                          Several employees are planning to depart their current employer within a few weeks
                          and have been careful to not engage in any activities that would conflict with their
                          duty to their current employer. They have just learned that one of their employer’s
                          clients has undertaken a request for proposal (RFP) to review and possibly hire a new
                          investment consultant. The RFP has been sent to the employer and all of its com-
                          petitors. The group believes that the new entity to be formed would be qualified to

respond to the RFP and be eligible for the business. The RFP submission period is likely
to conclude before the employees’ resignations are effective. Is it permissible for the
group of departing employees to respond to the RFP for their anticipated new firm?
       Comment: A group of employees responding to an RFP that their employer is
       also responding to would lead to direct competition between the employees
       and the employer. Such conduct violates Standard IV(A) unless the group
       of employees receives permission from their employer as well as the entity
       sending out the RFP.



Example 9 (Externally Compensated Assignments):
Alfonso Mota is a research analyst with Tyson Investments. He works part time as a
mayor for his hometown, a position for which he receives compensation. Must Mota
seek permission from Tyson to serve as mayor?
       Comment: If Mota’s mayoral duties are so extensive and time-consuming
       that they might detract from his ability to fulfill his responsibilities at Tyson,
       he should discuss his outside activities with his employer and come to a
       mutual agreement regarding how to manage his personal commitments
       with his responsibilities to his employer.



Example 10 (Soliciting Former Clients):
After leaving her employer, Shawna McQuillen establishes her own money management
business. While with her former employer, she did not sign a noncompete agreement
that would have prevented her from soliciting former clients. Upon her departure, she
does not take any of her client lists or contact information and she clears her personal
computer of any employer records, including client contact information. She obtains
the phone numbers of her former clients through public records and contacts them
to solicit their business.
       Comment: McQuillen is not in violation of Standard IV(A) because she
       has not used information or records from her former employer and is not
       prevented by an agreement with her former employer from soliciting her
       former clients.



Example 11 (Whistleblowing Actions):
Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy-side trading desk and concentrates on in-house
trades for a hedge fund subsidiary managed by a team at the investment management
firm. The hedge fund has been very successful and is marketed globally by the firm.
From her experience as the trader for much of the activity of the fund, Rasmussen has
become quite knowledgeable about the hedge fund’s strategy, tactics, and performance.
When a distinct break in the market occurs, however, and many of the securities
involved in the hedge fund’s strategy decline markedly in value, Rasmussen observes
that the reported performance of the hedge fund does not reflect this decline. In her
experience, the lack of any effect is a very unlikely occurrence. She approaches the head
of trading about her concern and is told that she should not ask any questions and that
the fund is big and successful and is not her concern. She is fairly sure something is
not right, so she contacts the compliance officer, who also tells her to stay away from
the issue of this hedge fund’s reporting.

                                 Comment: Rasmussen has clearly come upon an error in policies, pro-
                                 cedures, and compliance practices in the firm’s operations. Having been
                                 unsuccessful in finding a resolution with her supervisor and the compli-
                                 ance officer, Rasmussen should consult the firm’s whistleblowing policy to
                                 determine the appropriate next step toward informing management of her
                                 concerns. The potentially unethical actions of the investment management
                                 division are appropriate grounds for further disclosure, so Rasmussen’s
                                 whistleblowing would not represent a violation of Standard IV(A).

                          Example 12 (Soliciting Former Clients):
                          Angel Crome has been a private banker for YBSafe Bank for the past eight years. She
                          has been very successful and built a considerable client portfolio during that time
                          but is extremely frustrated by the recent loss of reputation by her current employer
                          and subsequent client insecurity. A locally renowned headhunter contacted Crome a
                          few days ago and offered her an interesting job with a competing private bank. This
                          bank offers a substantial signing bonus for advisers with their own client portfolios.
                          Crome figures that she can solicit at least 70% of her clients to follow her and gladly
                          enters into the new employment contract.
                                 Comment: Crome may contact former clients upon termination of her
                                 employment with YBSafe Bank, but she is prohibited from using client
                                 records built by and kept with her in her capacity as an employee of YBSafe
                                 Bank. Client lists are proprietary information of her former employer and
                                 must not be used for her or her new employer’s benefit. The use of writ-
                                 ten, electronic, or any other form of records other than publicly available
                                 information to contact her former clients at YBSafe Bank will be a violation
                                 of Standard IV(A).



                          Example 13 (Notification of Code and Standards):
                          Krista Smith is a relatively new assistant trader for the fixed-income desk of a major
                          investment bank. She is on a team responsible for structuring collateralized debt
                          obligations (CDOs) made up of securities in the inventory of the trading desk. At a
                          meeting of the team, senior executives explain the opportunity to eventually separate
                          the CDO into various risk-rated tranches to be sold to the clients of the firm. After the
                          senior executives leave the meeting, the head trader announces various responsibilities
                          of each member of the team and then says, “This is a good time to unload some of
                          the junk we have been stuck with for a while and disguise it with ratings and a thick,
                          unreadable prospectus, so don’t be shy in putting this CDO together. Just kidding.”
                          Smith is worried by this remark and asks some of her colleagues what the head trader
                          meant. They all respond that he was just kidding but that there is some truth in the
                          remark because the CDO is seen by management as an opportunity to improve the
                          quality of the securities in the firm’s inventory.
                              Concerned about the ethical environment of the workplace, Smith decides to
                          talk to her supervisor about her concerns and provides the head trader with a copy
                          of the Code and Standards. Smith discusses the principle of placing the client above
                          the interest of the firm and the possibility that the development of the new CDO will
                          not adhere to this responsibility. The head trader assures Smith that the appropriate
                          analysis will be conducted when determining the appropriate securities for collateral.
                          Furthermore, the ratings are assigned by an independent firm and the prospectus will

include full and factual disclosures. Smith is reassured by the meeting, but she also
reviews the company’s procedures and requirements for reporting potential violations
of company policy and securities laws.
       Comment: Smith’s review of the company policies and procedures for report-
       ing violations allows her to be prepared to report through the appropriate
       whistleblower process if she decides that the CDO development process
       involves unethical actions by others. Smith’s actions comply with the Code
       and Standards principles of placing the client’s interests first and being
       loyal to her employer. In providing her supervisor with a copy of the Code
       and Standards, Smith is highlighting the high level of ethical conduct she
       is required to adhere to in her professional activities.



Example 14 (Leaving an Employer):
Laura Webb just left her position as portfolio analyst at Research Systems, Inc. (RSI).
Her employment contract included a non-solicitation agreement that requires her to
wait two years before soliciting RSI clients for any investment-related services. Upon
leaving, Webb was informed that RSI would contact clients immediately about her
departure and introduce her replacement.
    While working at RSI, Webb connected with clients, other industry associates,
and friends through her LinkedIn network. Her business and personal relationships
were intermingled because she considered many of her clients to be personal friends.
Realizing that her LinkedIn network would be a valuable resource for new employment
opportunities, she updated her profile several days following her departure from RSI.
LinkedIn automatically sent a notification to Webb’s entire network that her employ-
ment status had been changed in her profile.
       Comment: Prior to her departure, Webb should have discussed any client
       information contained in her social media networks. By updating her
       LinkedIn profile after RSI notified clients and after her employment ended,
       she has appropriately placed her employer’s interests ahead of her own
       personal interests. In addition, she has not violated the non-solicitation
       agreement with RSI, unless it prohibited any contact with clients during
       the two-year period.


Example 15 (Confidential Firm Information):
Sanjay Gupta is a research analyst at Naram Investment Management (NIM). NIM
uses a team-based research process to develop recommendations on investment
opportunities covered by the team members. Gupta, like others, provides commen-
tary for NIM’s clients through the company blog, which is posted weekly on the NIM
password-protected website. According to NIM’s policy, every contribution to the
website must be approved by the company’s compliance department before posting.
Any opinions expressed on the website are disclosed as representing the perspective
of NIM.
    Gupta also writes a personal blog to share his experiences with friends and family.
As with most blogs, Gupta’s personal blog is widely available to interested readers
through various internet search engines. Occasionally, when he disagrees with the
team-based research opinions of NIM, Gupta uses his personal blog to express his
own opinions as a counterpoint to the commentary posted on the NIM website.
Gupta believes this provides his readers with a more complete perspective on these
investment opportunities.

                                 Comment: Gupta is in violation of Standard IV(A) for disclosing confidential
                                 firm information through his personal blog. The recommendations on the
                                 firm’s blog to clients are not freely available across the internet, but his

                          Guidance
                          Standard IV(B) requires members and candidates to obtain permission from their
                          employer before accepting compensation or other benefits from third parties for the
                          services rendered to the employer or for any services that might create a conflict with
                          their employer’s interest. Compensation and benefits include direct compensation by
                          the client and any indirect compensation or other benefits received from third parties.
                          “Written consent” includes any form of communication that can be documented (for
                          example, communication via e-mail that can be retrieved and documented).
                              Members and candidates must obtain permission for additional compensation/
                          benefits because such arrangements may affect loyalties and objectivity and create
                          potential conflicts of interest. Disclosure allows an employer to consider the outside
                          arrangements when evaluating the actions and motivations of members and candi-
                          dates. Moreover, the employer is entitled to have full knowledge of all compensation/
                          benefit arrangements so as to be able to assess the true cost of the services members
                          or candidates are providing.
                              There may be instances in which a member or candidate is hired by an employer
                          on a “part-time” basis. “Part-time” status applies to employees who do not commit
                          the full number of hours required for a normal work week. Members and candidates
                          should discuss possible limitations to their abilities to provide services that may be

STANDARD IV(B): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
Members and candidates should make an immediate written report to their supervisor
                                                                                           40
and compliance officer specifying any compensation they propose to receive for services
in addition to the compensation or benefits received from their employer. The details
of the report should be confirmed by the party offering the additional compensation,
including performance incentives offered by clients. This written report should state
the terms of any agreement under which a member or candidate will receive addi-
tional compensation; “terms” include the nature of the compensation, the approximate
amount of compensation, and the duration of the agreement.




STANDARD IV(B): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                           41
Example 1 (Notification of Client Bonus Compensation):
Geoff Whitman, a portfolio analyst for Adams Trust Company, manages the account
of Carol Cochran, a client. Whitman is paid a salary by his employer, and Cochran
pays the trust company a standard fee based on the market value of assets in her
portfolio. Cochran proposes to Whitman that “any year that my portfolio achieves at
least a 15% return before taxes, you and your wife can fly to Monaco at my expense
and use my condominium during the third week of January.” Whitman does not inform
his employer of the arrangement and vacations in Monaco the following January as
Cochran’s guest.
       Comment: Whitman violated Standard IV(B) by failing to inform his
       employer in writing of this supplemental, contingent compensation arrange-
       ment. The nature of the arrangement could have resulted in partiality to
       Cochran’s account, which could have detracted from Whitman’s perfor-
       mance with respect to other accounts he handles for Adams Trust. Whitman
       must obtain the consent of his employer to accept such a supplemental
       benefit.



Example 2 (Notification of Outside Compensation):
Terry Jones sits on the board of directors of Exercise Unlimited, Inc. In return for his
services on the board, Jones receives unlimited membership privileges for his family
at all Exercise Unlimited facilities. Jones purchases Exercise Unlimited stock for the
client accounts for which it is appropriate. Jones does not disclose this arrangement
to his employer because he does not receive monetary compensation for his services
to the board.
       Comment: Jones has violated Standard IV(B) by failing to disclose to his
       employer benefits received in exchange for his services on the board of
       directors. The nonmonetary compensation may create a conflict of interest
       in the same manner as being paid to serve as a director.

                          Example 3 (Prior Approval for Outside Compensation):
                          Jonathan Hollis is an analyst of oil-and-gas companies for Specialty Investment
                          Management. He is currently recommending the purchase of ABC Oil Company
                          shares and has published a long, well-thought-out research report to substantiate
                          his recommendation. Several weeks after publishing the report, Hollis receives a call
                          from the investor-relations office of ABC Oil saying that Thomas Andrews, CEO of
                          the company, saw the report and really liked the analyst’s grasp of the business and his
                          company. The investor-relations officer invites Hollis to visit ABC Oil to discuss the
                          industry further. ABC Oil offers to send a company plane to pick Hollis up and arrange
                          for his accommodations while visiting. Hollis, after gaining the appropriate approvals,
                          accepts the meeting with the CEO but declines the offered travel arrangements.
                              Several weeks later, Andrews and Hollis meet to discuss the oil business and Hollis’s
                          report. Following the meeting, Hollis joins Andrews and the investment relations
                          officer for dinner at an upscale restaurant near ABC Oil’s headquarters.
                              Upon returning to Specialty Investment Management, Hollis provides a full review
                          of the meeting to the director of research, including a disclosure of the dinner attended.
                                  Comment: Hollis’s actions did not violate Standard IV(B). Through gaining
                                  approval before accepting the meeting and declining the offered travel
                                  arrangements, Hollis sought to avoid any potential conflicts of interest
                                  between his company and ABC Oil. Because the location of the dinner was
                                  not available prior to arrival and Hollis notified his company of the dinner
                                  upon his return, accepting the dinner should not impair his objectivity. By
                                  disclosing the dinner, Hollis has enabled Specialty Investment Management
                                  to assess whether it has any impact on future reports and recommendations
                                  by Hollis related to ABC Oil.

Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors                                              161


Standard IV(C) states that members and candidates must promote actions by all
employees under their supervision and authority to comply with applicable laws,
rules, regulations, and firm policies and the Code and Standards.
    Any investment professional who has employees subject to her or his control or
influence—whether or not the employees are CFA Institute members, CFA charter-
holders, or candidates in the CFA Program—exercises supervisory responsibility.
Members and candidates acting as supervisors must also have in-depth knowledge
of the Code and Standards so that they can apply this knowledge in discharging their
supervisory responsibilities.
    The conduct that constitutes reasonable supervision in a particular case depends
on the number of employees supervised and the work performed by those employees.
Members and candidates with oversight responsibilities for large numbers of employees
may not be able to personally evaluate the conduct of these employees on a continuing
basis. These members and candidates may delegate supervisory duties to subordinates
who directly oversee the other employees. A member’s or candidate’s responsibilities
under Standard IV(C) include instructing those subordinates to whom supervision is
delegated about methods to promote compliance, including preventing and detecting
violations of laws, rules, regulations, firm policies, and the Code and Standards.
    At a minimum, Standard IV(C) requires that members and candidates with
supervisory responsibility make reasonable efforts to prevent and detect violations
by ensuring the establishment of effective compliance systems. However, an effective
compliance system goes beyond enacting a code of ethics, establishing policies and
procedures to achieve compliance with the code and applicable law, and reviewing
employee actions to determine whether they are following the rules.
    To be effective supervisors, members and candidates should implement educa-
tion and training programs on a recurring or regular basis for employees under their
supervision. Such programs will assist the employees with meeting their professional
obligations to practice in an ethical manner within the applicable legal system. Further,
establishing incentives—monetary or otherwise—for employees not only to meet
business goals but also to reward ethical behavior offers supervisors another way to
assist employees in complying with their legal and ethical obligations.
    Often, especially in large organizations, members and candidates may have super-
visory responsibility but not the authority to establish or modify firm-wide compliance
policies and procedures or incentive structures. Such limitations should not prevent
a member or candidate from working with his or her own superiors and within the
firm structure to develop and implement effective compliance tools, including but
not limited to
   ■   a code of ethics,
   ■   compliance policies and procedures,
   ■   education and training programs,
   ■   an incentive structure that rewards ethical conduct, and
   ■   adoption of firm-wide best practice standards (e.g., the GIPS standards, the
       CFA Institute Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct).
    A member or candidate with supervisory responsibility should bring an inadequate
compliance system to the attention of the firm’s senior managers and recommend
corrective action. If the member or candidate clearly cannot discharge supervisory
responsibilities because of the absence of a compliance system or because of an
inadequate compliance system, the member or candidate should decline in writing
to accept supervisory responsibility until the firm adopts reasonable procedures to
allow adequate exercise of supervisory responsibility.

                          System for Supervision
                          Members and candidates with supervisory responsibility must understand what
                          constitutes an adequate compliance system for their firms and make reasonable
                          efforts to see that appropriate compliance procedures are established, documented,
                          communicated to covered personnel, and followed. “Adequate” procedures are those
                          designed to meet industry standards, regulatory requirements, the requirements of the
                          Code and Standards, and the circumstances of the firm. Once compliance procedures
                          are established, the supervisor must also make reasonable efforts to ensure that the
                          procedures are monitored and enforced.
                              To be effective, compliance procedures must be in place prior to the occurrence
                          of a violation of the law or the Code and Standards. Although compliance procedures
                          cannot be designed to anticipate every potential violation, they should be designed to
                          anticipate the activities most likely to result in misconduct. Compliance programs must
                          be appropriate for the size and nature of the organization. The member or candidate
                          should review model compliance procedures or other industry programs to ensure
                          that the firm’s procedures meet the minimum industry standards.
                              Once a supervisor learns that an employee has violated or may have violated the
                          law or the Code and Standards, the supervisor must promptly initiate an assessment
                          to determine the extent of the wrongdoing. Relying on an employee’s statements
                          about the extent of the violation or assurances that the wrongdoing will not reoccur
                          is not enough. Reporting the misconduct up the chain of command and warning
                          the employee to cease the activity are also not enough. Pending the outcome of the
                          investigation, a supervisor should take steps to ensure that the violation will not be
                          repeated, such as placing limits on the employee’s activities or increasing the moni-
                          toring of the employee’s activities.

                          Supervision Includes Detection
                          Members and candidates with supervisory responsibility must also make reasonable
                          efforts to detect violations of laws, rules, regulations, firm policies, and the Code
                          and Standards. The supervisors exercise reasonable supervision by establishing and
                          implementing written compliance procedures and ensuring that those procedures are
                          followed through periodic review. If a member or candidate has adopted reasonable
                          procedures and taken steps to institute an effective compliance program, then the
                          member or candidate may not be in violation of Standard IV(C) if he or she does not
                          detect violations that occur despite these efforts. The fact that violations do occur
                          may indicate, however, that the compliance procedures are inadequate. In addition, in
                          some cases, merely enacting such procedures may not be sufficient to fulfill the duty
                          required by Standard IV(C). A member or candidate may be in violation of Standard
                          IV(C) if he or she knows or should know that the procedures designed to promote
                          compliance, including detecting and preventing violations, are not being followed.

                          Codes of Ethics or Compliance Procedures
                          Members and candidates are encouraged to recommend that their employers adopt
                          a code of ethics. Adoption of a code of ethics is critical to establishing a strong eth-
                          ical foundation for investment advisory firms and their employees. Codes of ethics

formally emphasize and reinforce the client loyalty responsibilities of investment firm
personnel, protect investing clients by deterring misconduct, and protect the firm’s
reputation for integrity.
    There is a distinction, however, between codes of ethics and the specific policies
and procedures needed to ensure compliance with the codes and with securities laws
and regulations. Although both are important, codes of ethics should consist of fun-
damental, principle-based ethical and fiduciary concepts that are applicable to all of
the firm’s employees. In this way, firms can best convey to employees and clients the
ethical ideals that investment advisers strive to achieve. These concepts need to be
implemented, however, by detailed, firm-wide compliance policies and procedures.
Compliance procedures assist the firm’s personnel in fulfilling the responsibilities
enumerated in the code of ethics and make probable that the ideals expressed in the
code of ethics will be adhered to in the day-to-day operation of the firm.
    Standalone codes of ethics should be written in plain language and should address
general fiduciary concepts. They should be unencumbered by numerous detailed pro-
cedures. Codes presented in this way are the most effective in stressing to employees
that they are in positions of trust and must act with integrity at all times. Mingling
compliance procedures in the firm’s code of ethics goes against the goal of reinforcing
the ethical obligations of employees.
    Separating the code of ethics from compliance procedures will also reduce, if not
eliminate, the legal terminology and “boilerplate” language that can make the under-
lying ethical principles incomprehensible to the average person. Above all, to ensure
the creation of a culture of ethics and integrity rather than one that merely focuses
on following the rules, the principles in the code of ethics must be stated in a way
that is accessible and understandable to everyone in the firm.
    Members and candidates should encourage their employers to provide their codes
of ethics to clients. In this case also, a simple, straightforward code of ethics will be
best understood by clients. Unencumbered by the compliance procedures, the code of
ethics will be effective in conveying that the firm is committed to conducting business
in an ethical manner and in the best interests of the clients.


Adequate Compliance Procedures
A supervisor complies with Standard IV(C) by identifying situations in which legal
violations or violations of the Code and Standards are likely to occur and by estab-
lishing and enforcing compliance procedures to prevent such violations. Adequate
compliance procedures should
   ■   be contained in a clearly written and accessible manual that is tailored to the
       firm’s operations,
   ■   be drafted so that the procedures are easy to understand,
   ■   designate a compliance officer whose authority and responsibility are clearly
       defined and who has the necessary resources and authority to implement
       the firm’s compliance procedures,
   ■   describe the hierarchy of supervision and assign duties among supervisors,
   ■   implement a system of checks and balances,
   ■   outline the scope of the procedures,
   ■   outline procedures to document the monitoring and testing of compliance
       procedures,
   ■   outline permissible conduct, and
   ■   delineate procedures for reporting violations and sanctions.

                              Once a compliance program is in place, a supervisor should
                              ■   disseminate the contents of the program to appropriate personnel,
                              ■   periodically update procedures to ensure that the measures are adequate
                                  under the law,
                              ■   continually educate personnel regarding the compliance procedures,
                              ■   issue periodic reminders of the procedures to appropriate personnel,
                              ■   incorporate a professional conduct evaluation as part of an employee’s per-

                              ■   review the actions of employees to ensure compliance and identify violators,
                                  and
                              ■   take the necessary steps to enforce the procedures once a violation has
                                  occurred.
                              Once a violation is discovered, a supervisor should
                              ■   respond promptly,
                              ■   conduct a thorough investigation of the activities to determine the scope of
                                  the wrongdoing,
                              ■   increase supervision or place appropriate limitations on the wrongdoer
                                  pending the outcome of the investigation, and
                              ■   review procedures for potential changes necessary to prevent future viola-

                          Implementation of Compliance Education and Training
                          No amount of ethics education and awareness will deter someone determined to com-
                          mit fraud for personal enrichment. But the vast majority of investment professionals
                          strive to achieve personal success with dedicated service to their clients and employers.
                              Regular ethics and compliance training, in conjunction with adoption of a code
                          of ethics, is critical to investment firms seeking to establish a strong culture of integ-
                          rity and to provide an environment in which employees routinely engage in ethical
                          conduct in compliance with the law. Training and education assist individuals in both
                          recognizing areas that are prone to ethical and legal pitfalls and identifying those
                          circumstances and influences that can impair ethical judgment.
                              By implementing educational programs, supervisors can train their subordinates
                          to put into practice what the firm’s code of ethics requires. Education helps employees
                          make the link between legal and ethical conduct and the long-term success of the
                          business; a strong culture of compliance signals to clients and potential clients that
                          the firm has truly embraced ethical conduct as fundamental to the firm’s mission to
                          serve its clients.


                          Establish an Appropriate Incentive Structure
                          Even if individuals want to make the right choices and follow an ethical course of
                          conduct and are aware of the obstacles that may trip them up, they can still be influ-
                          enced to act improperly by a corporate culture that embraces a “succeed at all costs”
                          mentality, stresses results regardless of the methods used to achieve those results, and
                          does not reward ethical behavior. Supervisors can reinforce an individual’s natural
                          desire to “do the right thing” by building a culture of integrity in the workplace.
                              Supervisors and firms must look closely at their incentive structure to determine
                          whether the structure encourages profits and returns at the expense of ethically appro-
                          priate conduct. Reward structures may turn a blind eye to how desired outcomes are

STANDARD IV(C): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                             44
Example 1 (Supervising Research Activities):
Jane Mattock, senior vice president and head of the research department of H&V, Inc.,
a regional brokerage firm, has decided to change her recommendation for Timber
Products from buy to sell. In line with H&V’s procedures, she orally advises certain
other H&V executives of her proposed actions before the report is prepared for pub-
lication. As a result of Mattock’s conversation with Dieter Frampton, one of the H&V
executives accountable to Mattock, Frampton immediately sells Timber’s stock from
his own account and from certain discretionary client accounts. In addition, other
personnel inform certain institutional customers of the changed recommendation
before it is printed and disseminated to all H&V customers who have received pre-
vious Timber reports.
       Comment: Mattock has violated Standard IV(C) by failing to reasonably
       and adequately supervise the actions of those accountable to her. She
       did not prevent or establish reasonable procedures designed to prevent
       dissemination of or trading on the information by those who knew of her
       changed recommendation. She must ensure that her firm has procedures
       for reviewing or recording any trading in the stock of a corporation that has
       been the subject of an unpublished change in recommendation. Adequate
       procedures would have informed the subordinates of their duties and
       detected sales by Frampton and selected customers.



Example 2 (Supervising Research Activities):
Deion Miller is the research director for Jamestown Investment Programs. The portfolio
managers have become critical of Miller and his staff because the Jamestown portfolios
do not include any stock that has been the subject of a merger or tender offer. Georgia
Ginn, a member of Miller’s staff, tells Miller that she has been studying a local company,
Excelsior, Inc., and recommends its purchase. Ginn adds that the company has been
widely rumored to be the subject of a merger study by a well-known conglomerate and
discussions between them are under way. At Miller’s request, Ginn prepares a memo
recommending the stock. Miller passes along Ginn’s memo to the portfolio managers
prior to leaving for vacation, and he notes that he has not reviewed the memo. As
a result of the memo, the portfolio managers buy Excelsior stock immediately. The
day Miller returns to the office, he learns that Ginn’s only sources for the report were
her brother, who is an acquisitions analyst with Acme Industries, the “well-known
conglomerate,” and that the merger discussions were planned but not held.
       Comment: Miller violated Standard IV(C) by not exercising reasonable
       supervision when he disseminated the memo without checking to ensure
       that Ginn had a reasonable and adequate basis for her recommendations
       and that Ginn was not relying on material nonpublic information.

                          Example 3 (Supervising Trading Activities):
                          David Edwards, a trainee trader at Wheeler & Company, a major national brokerage
                          firm, assists a customer in paying for the securities of Highland, Inc., by using antic-
                          ipated profits from the immediate sale of the same securities. Despite the fact that
                          Highland is not on Wheeler’s recommended list, a large volume of its stock is traded
                          through Wheeler in this manner. Roberta Ann Mason is a Wheeler vice president
                          responsible for supervising compliance with the securities laws in the trading depart-
                          ment. Part of her compensation from Wheeler is based on commission revenues from
                          the trading department. Although she notices the increased trading activity, she does
                          nothing to investigate or halt it.
                                 Comment: Mason’s failure to adequately review and investigate purchase
                                 orders in Highland stock executed by Edwards and her failure to super-
                                 vise the trainee’s activities violate Standard IV(C). Supervisors should
                                 be especially sensitive to actual or potential conflicts between their own
                                 self-interests and their supervisory responsibilities.



                          Example 4 (Supervising Trading Activities and Record Keeping):
                          Samantha Tabbing is senior vice president and portfolio manager for Crozet, Inc., a
                          registered investment advisory and registered broker/dealer firm. She reports to Charles
                          Henry, the president of Crozet. Crozet serves as the investment adviser and principal
                          underwriter for ABC and XYZ public mutual funds. The two funds’ prospectuses allow
                          Crozet to trade financial futures for the funds for the limited purpose of hedging against
                          market risks. Henry, extremely impressed by Tabbing’s performance in the past two
                          years, directs Tabbing to act as portfolio manager for the funds. For the benefit of its
                          employees, Crozet has also organized the Crozet Employee Profit-Sharing Plan (CEPSP),
                          a defined contribution retirement plan. Henry assigns Tabbing to manage 20% of the
                          assets of CEPSP. Tabbing’s investment objective for her portion of CEPSP’s assets is
                          aggressive growth. Unbeknownst to Henry, Tabbing frequently places S&P 500 Index
                          purchase and sale orders for the funds and the CEPSP without providing the futures
                          commission merchants (FCMs) who take the orders with any prior or simultaneous
                          designation of the account for which the trade has been placed. Frequently, neither
                          Tabbing nor anyone else at Crozet completes an internal trade ticket to record the
                          time an order was placed or the specific account for which the order was intended.
                          FCMs often designate a specific account only after the trade, when Tabbing provides
                          such designation. Crozet has no written operating procedures or compliance manual
                          concerning its futures trading, and its compliance department does not review such
                          trading. After observing the market’s movement, Tabbing assigns to CEPSP the S&P
                          500 positions with more favorable execution prices and assigns positions with less
                          favorable execution prices to the funds.
                                 Comment: Henry violated Standard IV(C) by failing to adequately super-
                                 vise Tabbing with respect to her S&P 500 trading. Henry further violated
                                 Standard IV(C) by failing to establish record-keeping and reporting pro-
                                 cedures to prevent or detect Tabbing’s violations. Henry must make a rea-
                                 sonable effort to determine that adequate compliance procedures covering
                                 all employee trading activity are established, documented, communicated,
                                 and followed.

Example 5 (Accepting Responsibility):
Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy-side trading desk and concentrates on in-house
trades for a hedge fund subsidiary managed by a team at the investment management
firm. The hedge fund has been very successful and is marketed globally by the firm.
From her experience as the trader for much of the activity of the fund, Rasmussen has
become quite knowledgeable about the hedge fund’s strategy, tactics, and performance.
When a distinct break in the market occurs and many of the securities involved in the
hedge fund’s strategy decline markedly in value, however, Rasmussen observes that
the reported performance of the hedge fund does not at all reflect this decline. From
her experience, this lack of an effect is a very unlikely occurrence. She approaches the
head of trading about her concern and is told that she should not ask any questions
and that the fund is too big and successful and is not her concern. She is fairly sure
something is not right, so she contacts the compliance officer and is again told to stay
away from the hedge fund reporting issue.
       Comment: Rasmussen has clearly come upon an error in policies, proce-
       dures, and compliance practices within the firm’s operations. According to
       Standard IV(C), the supervisor and the compliance officer have the respon-
       sibility to review the concerns brought forth by Rasmussen. Supervisors
       have the responsibility of establishing and encouraging an ethical culture
       in the firm. The dismissal of Rasmussen’s question violates Standard IV(C)
       and undermines the firm’s ethical operations.

Example 6 (Inadequate Procedures):
Brendan Witt, a former junior sell-side technology analyst, decided to return to
school to earn an MBA. To keep his research skills and industry knowledge sharp,
Witt accepted a position with On-line and Informed, an independent internet-based
research company. The position requires the publication of a recommendation and
report on a different company every month. Initially, Witt is a regular contributor
of new research and a participant in the associated discussion boards that generally
have positive comments on the technology sector. Over time, his ability to manage
his educational requirements and his work requirements begin to conflict with one
another. Knowing a recommendation is due the next day for On-line, Witt creates a
report based on a few news articles and what the conventional wisdom of the markets
has deemed the “hot” security of the day.
       Comment: Allowing the report submitted by Witt to be posted highlights a
       lack of compliance procedures by the research firm. Witt’s supervisor needs
       to work with the management of On-line to develop an appropriate review
       process to ensure that all contracted analysts comply with the requirements.

Example 7 (Inadequate Supervision):
Michael Papis is the chief investment officer of his state’s retirement fund. The fund
has always used outside advisers for the real estate allocation, and this information is
clearly presented in all fund communications. Thomas Nagle, a recognized sell-side
research analyst and Papis’s business school classmate, recently left the investment
bank he worked for to start his own asset management firm, Accessible Real Estate.

                          Nagle is trying to build his assets under management and contacts Papis about gaining
                          some of the retirement fund’s allocation. In the previous few years, the performance
                          of the retirement fund’s real estate investments was in line with the fund’s benchmark
                          but was not extraordinary. Papis decides to help out his old friend and also to seek
                          better returns by moving the real estate allocation to Accessible. The only notice of the
                          change in adviser appears in the next annual report in the listing of associated advisers.
                                 Comment: Papis’s actions highlight the need for supervision and review at
                                 all levels in an organization. His responsibilities may include the selection
                                 of external advisers, but the decision to change advisers appears arbitrary.
                                 Members and candidates should ensure that their firm has appropriate
                                 policies and procedures in place to detect inappropriate actions, such as
                                 the action taken by Papis.

                          Example 8 (Supervising Research Activities):
                          Mary Burdette was recently hired by Fundamental Investment Management (FIM)
                          as a junior auto industry analyst. Burdette is expected to expand the social media
                          presence of the firm because she is active with various networks, including Facebook,
                          LinkedIn, and X. Although Burdette’s supervisor, Joe Graf, has never used social media,
                          he encourages Burdette to explore opportunities to increase FIM’s online presence
                          and ability to share content, communicate, and broadcast information to clients. In
                          response to Graf ’s encouragement, Burdette is working on a proposal detailing the
                          advantages of getting FIM onto X in addition to launching a company Facebook page.
                              As part of her auto industry research for FIM, Burdette is completing a report on
                          the financial impact of Sun Drive Auto Ltd.’s new solar technology for compact auto-
                          mobiles. This research report will be her first for FIM, and she believes Sun Drive’s
                          technology could revolutionize the auto industry. In her excitement, Burdette sends
                          a quick post to FIM X followers summarizing her “buy” recommendation for Sun
                          Drive Auto stock.
                                 Comment: Graf has violated Standard IV(C) by failing to reasonably super-
                                 vise Burdette with respect to the contents of her post. He did not estab-
                                 lish reasonable procedures to prevent the unauthorized dissemination of
                                 company research through social media networks. Graf must make sure
                                 all employees receive regular training about FIM’s policies and procedures,
                                 including the appropriate business use of personal social media networks.

                          Chen supervises a team of 10 analysts in a fast-paced and understaffed organization.

various websites and blogs on the banking sector for whatever she can find on ZYX.
One independent blogger provides a new interpretation of the recently reported data
Huang has analyzed and concludes with a strong “sell” recommendation for ZYX. She
is impressed by the originality and resourcefulness of this blogger’s report.
    Very late in the evening, Huang submits her report and “sell” recommendation to
Chen without any reference to the independent blogger’s report. Given the late time
of the submission and the competence of Huang’s prior work, Chen compiles this
report with the recommendations from each of the other analysts and meets with
the portfolio managers to discuss implementation.
       Comment: Chen has violated Standard IV(C) by neglecting to reasonably
       and adequately follow the firm’s approved review process for Huang’s
       research report. The delayed submission and the quality of prior work do
       not remove Chen’s requirement to uphold the designated review process. A

                          The application of Standard V(A) depends on the investment philosophy the member,
                          candidate, or firm is following, the role of the member or candidate in the investment
                          decision-making process, and the support and resources provided by the member’s
                          or candidate’s employer. These factors will dictate the nature of the diligence and
                          thoroughness of the research and the level of investigation required by Standard V(A).
                              The requirements for issuing conclusions based on research will vary in relation
                          to the member’s or candidate’s role in the investment decision-making process, but
                          the member or candidate must make reasonable efforts to cover all pertinent issues
                          when arriving at a recommendation. Members and candidates enhance transparency
                          by providing or offering to provide supporting information to clients when recom-
                          mending a purchase or sale or when changing a recommendation.

                          Defining Diligence and Reasonable Basis
                          Every investment decision is based on a set of facts known and understood at the time.
                          Clients turn to members and candidates for advice and expect these advisers to have
                          more information and knowledge than they do. This information and knowledge is
                          the basis from which members and candidates apply their professional judgment in
                          taking investment actions and making recommendations.
                              At a basic level, clients want assurance that members and candidates are put-
                          ting forth the necessary effort to support the recommendations they are making.
                          Communicating the level and thoroughness of the information reviewed before the
                          member or candidate makes a judgment allows clients to understand the reasonable-
                          ness of the recommended investment actions.
                              As with determining the suitability of an investment for the client, the necessary
                          level of research and analysis will differ with the product, security, or service being
                          offered. In providing an investment service, members and candidates typically use
                          a variety of resources, including company reports, third-party research, and results
                          from quantitative models. A reasonable basis is formed through a balance of these
                          resources appropriate for the security or decision being analyzed.
                              The following list provides some, but definitely not all, examples of attributes to
                          consider while forming the basis for a recommendation:
                              ■   global, regional, and country macroeconomic conditions,
                              ■   a company’s operating and financial history,
                              ■   the industry’s and sector’s current conditions and the stage of the business
                                  cycle,
                              ■   a mutual fund’s fee structure and management history,
                              ■   the output and potential limitations of quantitative models,
                              ■   the quality of the assets included in a securitization, and
                              ■   the appropriateness of selected peer-group comparisons.
                              Even though an investment recommendation may be well informed, downside
                          risk remains for any investment. Members and candidates can base their decisions
                          only on the information available at the time decisions are made. The steps taken in
                          developing a diligent and reasonable recommendation should minimize unexpected
                          downside events.

Standard V: Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Actions                               171


Using Secondary or Third-Party Research
If members and candidates rely on secondary or third-party research, they must
make reasonable and diligent efforts to determine whether such research is sound.
Secondary research is defined as research conducted by someone else in the member’s
or candidate’s firm. Third-party research is research conducted by entities outside
the member’s or candidate’s firm, such as a brokerage firm, bank, or research firm.
If a member or candidate has reason to suspect that either secondary or third-party
research or information comes from a source that lacks a sound basis, the member
or candidate must not rely on that information.
    Members and candidates should make reasonable enquiries into the source and
accuracy of all data used in completing their investment analysis and recommenda-
tions. The sources of the information and data will influence the level of the review
a member or candidate must undertake. Information and data taken from internet
sources, such as personal blogs, independent research aggregation websites, or social
media websites, likely require a greater level of review than information from more
established research organizations.
    Criteria that a member or candidate can use in forming an opinion on whether
research is sound include the following:
   ■   assumptions used,
   ■   rigor of the analysis performed,
   ■   date/timeliness of the research, and
   ■   evaluation of the objectivity and independence of the recommendations.
    A member or candidate may rely on others in his or her firm to determine whether
secondary or third-party research is sound and use the information in good faith
unless the member or candidate has reason to question its validity or the processes
and procedures used by those responsible for the research. For example, a portfolio
manager may not have a choice of a data source because the firm’s senior managers
conducted due diligence to determine which vendor would provide services; the mem-
ber or candidate can use the information in good faith assuming the due diligence
process was deemed adequate.
    A member or candidate should verify that the firm has a policy about the timely
and consistent review of approved research providers to ensure that the quality of the
research continues to meet the necessary standards. If such a policy is not in place at
the firm, the member or candidate should encourage the development and adoption
of a formal review practice.

Using Quantitatively Oriented Research
Standard V(A) applies to the rapidly expanding use of quantitatively oriented research
models and processes, such as computer-generated modeling, screening, and rank-
ing of investment securities; the creation or valuation of derivative instruments; and
quantitative portfolio construction techniques. These models and processes are being
used for much more than the backtesting of investment strategies, especially with con-
tinually advancing technology and techniques. The continued broad development of
quantitative methods and models is an important part of capital market developments.
    Members and candidates need to have an understanding of the parameters used
in models and quantitative research that are incorporated into their investment rec-
ommendations. Although they are not required to become experts in every technical
aspect of the models, they must understand the assumptions and limitations inherent
in any model and how the results were used in the decision-making process.
    The reliance on and potential limitations of financial models became clear through
the investment crisis that unfolded in 2007 and 2008. In some cases, the financial models
used to value specific securities and related derivative products did not adequately

                          demonstrate the level of associated risks. Members and candidates should make rea-
                          sonable efforts to test the output of investment models and other pre-programmed
                          analytical tools they use. Such validation should occur before incorporating the process
                          into their methods, models, or analyses.
                              Although not every model can test for every factor or outcome, members and
                          candidates should ensure that their analyses incorporate a broad range of assumptions
                          sufficient to capture the underlying characteristics of investments. The omission from
                          the analysis of potentially negative outcomes or of levels of risk outside the norm may
                          misrepresent the true economic value of an investment. The possible scenarios for
                          analysis should include factors that are likely to have a substantial influence on the
                          investment value and may include extremely positive and negative scenarios.

                          Developing Quantitatively Oriented Techniques
                          Individuals who create new quantitative models and services must exhibit a higher
                          level of diligence in reviewing new products than the individuals who ultimately use
                          the analytical output. Members and candidates involved in the development and
                          oversight of quantitatively oriented models, methods, and algorithms must understand
                          the technical aspects of the products they provide to clients. A thorough testing of
                          the model and resulting analysis should be completed prior to product distribution.
                              Members and candidates need to consider the source and time horizon of the data
                          used as inputs in financial models. The information from many commercially available
                          databases may not effectively incorporate both positive and negative market cycles.
                          In the development of a recommendation, the member or candidate may need to test
                          the models by using volatility and performance expectations that represent scenarios
                          outside the observable databases. In reviewing the computer models or the resulting
                          output, members and candidates need to pay particular attention to the assumptions
                          used in the analysis and the rigor of the analysis to ensure that the model incorporates
                          a wide range of possible input expectations, including negative market events.

                          Selecting External Advisers and Subadvisers
                          Financial instruments and asset allocation techniques continue to develop and evolve.
                          This progression has led to the use of specialized managers to invest in specific asset
                          classes or diversification strategies that complement a firm’s in-house expertise.
                          Standard V(A) applies to the level of review necessary in selecting an external adviser
                          or subadviser to manage a specifically mandated allocation. Members and candidates
                          must review managers as diligently as they review individual funds and securities.
                              Members and candidates who are directly involved with the use of external advisers
                          need to ensure that their firms have standardized criteria for reviewing these selected
                          external advisers and managers. Such criteria would include, but would not be limited
                          to, the following:
                              ■   reviewing the adviser’s established code of ethics,
                              ■   understanding the adviser’s compliance and internal control procedures,
                              ■   assessing the quality of the published return information, and
                              ■   reviewing the adviser’s investment process and adherence to its stated
                                  strategy.
                              Codes, standards, and guides to best practice published by CFA Institute provide
                          members and candidates with examples of acceptable practices for external advisers

Group Research and Decision Making
Commonly, members and candidates are part of a group or team that is collectively
responsible for producing investment analysis or research. The conclusions or rec-
ommendations of the group report represent the consensus of the group and are not
necessarily the views of the member or candidate, even though the name of the member
or candidate is included on the report. In some instances, a member or candidate will
not agree with the view of the group. If, however, the member or candidate believes
that the consensus opinion has a reasonable and adequate basis and is independent and
objective, the member or candidate need not decline to be identified with the report.
If the member or candidate is confident in the process, the member or candidate does
not need to dissociate from the report even if it does not reflect his or her opinion.




STANDARD V(A): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
Members and candidates should encourage their firms to consider the following
                                                                                         46
policies and procedures to support the principles of Standard V(A):
   ■   Establish a policy requiring that research reports, credit ratings, and invest-
       ment recommendations have a basis that can be substantiated as reasonable
       and adequate. An individual employee (a supervisory analyst) or a group of
       employees (a review committee) should be appointed to review and approve
       such items prior to external circulation to determine whether the criteria
       established in the policy have been met.
   ■   Develop detailed, written guidance for analysts (research, investment, or
       credit), supervisory analysts, and review committees that establishes the due
       diligence procedures for judging whether a particular recommendation has
       a reasonable and adequate basis.
   ■   Develop measurable criteria for assessing the quality of research, the rea-
       sonableness and adequacy of the basis for any recommendation or rating,
       and the accuracy of recommendations over time. In some cases, firms may
       consider implementing compensation arrangements that depend on these
       measurable criteria and that are applied consistently to all related analysts.
   ■   Develop detailed, written guidance that establishes minimum levels of sce-
       nario testing of all computer-based models used in developing, rating, and
       evaluating financial instruments. The policy should contain criteria related
       to the breadth of the scenarios tested, the accuracy of the output over time,
       and the analysis of cash flow sensitivity to inputs.
   ■   Develop measurable criteria for assessing outside providers, including the
       quality of information being provided, the reasonableness and adequacy of
       the provider’s collection practices, and the accuracy of the information over
       time. The established policy should outline how often the provider’s prod-
       ucts are reviewed.
   ■   Adopt a standardized set of criteria for evaluating the adequacy of external
       advisers. The policy should include how often and on what basis the alloca-
       tion of funds to the adviser will be reviewed.

            47            STANDARD V(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                          Example 1 (Sufficient Due Diligence):
                          Helen Hawke manages the corporate finance department of Sarkozi Securities, Ltd.
                          The firm is anticipating that the government will soon close a tax loophole that cur-
                          rently allows oil-and-gas exploration companies to pass on drilling expenses to holders
                          of a certain class of shares. Because market demand for this tax-advantaged class of
                          stock is currently high, Sarkozi convinces several companies to undertake new equity
                          financings at once, before the loophole closes. Time is of the essence, but Sarkozi
                          lacks sufficient resources to conduct adequate research on all the prospective issuing
                          companies. Hawke decides to estimate the IPO prices on the basis of the relative size
                          of each company and to justify the pricing later when her staff has time.
                                 Comment: Sarkozi should have taken on only the work that it could ade-
                                 quately handle. By categorizing the issuers by general size, Hawke has
                                 bypassed researching all the other relevant aspects that should be consid-
                                 ered when pricing new issues and thus has not performed sufficient due
                                 diligence. Such an omission can result in investors purchasing shares at
                                 prices that have no actual basis. Hawke has violated Standard V(A).



                          Example 2 (Sufficient Scenario Testing):
                          Babu Dhaliwal works for Heinrich Brokerage in the corporate finance group. He has
                          just persuaded Feggans Resources, Ltd., to allow his firm to do a secondary equity
                          financing at Feggans Resources’ current stock price. Because the stock has been trad-
                          ing at higher multiples than similar companies with equivalent production, Dhaliwal
                          presses the Feggans Resources managers to project what would be the maximum
                          production they could achieve in an optimal scenario. Based on these numbers, he is
                          able to justify the price his firm will be asking for the secondary issue. During a sales
                          pitch to the brokers, Dhaliwal then uses these numbers as the base-case production
                          levels that Feggans Resources will achieve.
                                 Comment: When presenting information to the brokers, Dhaliwal should
                                 have given a range of production scenarios and the probability of Feggans
                                 Resources achieving each level. By giving the maximum production level
                                 as the likely level of production, he has misrepresented the chances of
                                 achieving that production level and seriously misled the brokers. Dhaliwal
                                 has violated Standard V(A).



                          Example 3 (Developing a Reasonable Basis):
                          Brendan Witt, a former junior sell-side technology analyst, decided to return to
                          school to earn an MBA. To keep his research skills and industry knowledge sharp,
                          Witt accepted a position with On-line and Informed, an independent internet-based
                          research company. The position requires the publication of a recommendation and
                          report on a different company every month. Initially, Witt is a regular contributor
                          of new research and a participant in the associated discussion boards that generally
                          have positive comments on the technology sector. Over time, his ability to manage
                          his educational requirements and his work requirements begin to conflict with one

another. Knowing a recommendation is due the next day for On-line, Witt creates a
report based on a few news articles and what the conventional wisdom of the markets
has deemed the “hot” security of the day.
       Comment: Witt’s knowledge of and exuberance for technology stocks, a
       few news articles, and the conventional wisdom of the markets do not
       constitute, without more information, a reasonable and adequate basis for
       a stock recommendation that is supported by appropriate research and
       investigation. Therefore, Witt has violated Standard V(A).

Example 4 (Timely Client Updates):
Kristen Chandler is an investment consultant in the London office of Dalton Securities,
a major global investment consultant firm. One of her UK pension funds has decided
to appoint a specialist US equity manager. Dalton’s global manager of research relies
on local consultants to cover managers within their regions and, after conducting
thorough due diligence, puts their views and ratings in Dalton’s manager database.
Chandler accesses Dalton’s global manager research database and conducts a screen
of all US equity managers on the basis of a match with the client’s desired philoso-
phy/style, performance, and tracking-error targets. She selects the five managers that
meet these criteria and puts them in a briefing report that is delivered to the client
10 days later. Between the time of Chandler’s database search and the delivery of the
report to the client, Chandler is told that Dalton has updated the database with the
information that one of the firms that Chandler has recommended for consideration
lost its chief investment officer, the head of its US equity research, and the majority
of its portfolio managers on the US equity product—all of whom have left to establish
their own firm. Chandler does not revise her report with this updated information.
       Comment: Chandler has failed to satisfy the requirement of Standard V(A).
       Although Dalton updated the manager ratings to reflect the personnel
       turnover at one of the firms, Chandler did not update her report to reflect
       the new information.


Example 5 (Group Research Opinions):
Evelyn Mastakis is a junior analyst who has been asked by her firm to write a research
report predicting the expected interest rate for residential mortgages over the next
six months. Mastakis submits her report to the fixed-income investment committee
of her firm for review, as required by firm procedures. Although some committee
members support Mastakis’s conclusion, the majority of the committee disagrees with
her conclusion, and the report is significantly changed to indicate that interest rates
are likely to increase more than originally predicted by Mastakis. Should Mastakis
ask that her name be taken off the report when it is disseminated?
       Comment: The results of research are not always clear, and different people
       may have different opinions based on the same factual evidence. In this case,
       the committee may have valid reasons for issuing a report that differs from
       the analyst’s original research. The firm can issue a report that is different
       from the original report of an analyst as long as there is a reasonable and
       adequate basis for its conclusions.

                                     Generally, analysts must write research reports that reflect their own
                                 opinion and can ask the firm not to put their name on reports that ultimately
                                 differ from that opinion. When the work is a group effort, however, not all
                                 members of the team may agree with all aspects of the report. Ultimately,
                                 members and candidates can ask to have their names removed from the
                                 report, but if they are satisfied that the process has produced results or
                                 conclusions that have a reasonable and adequate basis, members and can-
                                 didates do not have to dissociate from the report even when they do not
                                 agree with its contents. If Mastakis is confident in the process, she does not
                                 need to dissociate from the report even if it does not reflect her opinion.



                          Example 6 (Reliance on Third-Party Research):
                          Gary McDermott runs a two-person investment management firm. McDermott’s firm
                          subscribes to a service from a large investment research firm that provides research
                          reports. McDermott’s firm makes investment recommendations on the basis of these
                          reports.
                                 Comment: Members and candidates can rely on third-party research but
                                 must make reasonable and diligent efforts to determine that such research
                                 is sound. If McDermott undertakes due diligence efforts on a regular basis
                                 to ensure that the research produced by the large firm is objective and
                                 reasonably based, McDermott can rely on that research when making
                                 investment recommendations to clients.



                          Example 7 (Due Diligence in Submanager Selection):
                          Paul Ostrowski’s business has grown significantly over the past couple of years,
                          and some clients want to diversify internationally. Ostrowski decides to find a sub-
                          manager to handle the expected international investments. Because this will be his
                          first subadviser, Ostrowski uses the CFA Institute model “request for proposal” to
                          design a questionnaire for his search. By his deadline, he receives seven completed
                          questionnaires from a variety of domestic and international firms trying to gain his
                          business. Ostrowski reviews all the applications in detail and decides to select the
                          firm that charges the lowest fees because doing so will have the least impact on his
                          firm’s bottom line.
                                 Comment: The selection of an external adviser or subadviser should be
                                 based on a full and complete review of the adviser’s services, performance
                                 history, and cost structure. In basing the decision on the fee structure alone,
                                 Ostrowski may be violating Standard V(A).

                          Example 8 (Sufficient Due Diligence):
                          Michael Papis is the chief investment officer of his state’s retirement fund. The fund
                          has always used outside advisers for the real estate allocation, and this information is
                          clearly presented in all fund communications. Thomas Nagle, a recognized sell-side
                          research analyst and Papis’s business school classmate, recently left the investment
                          bank he worked for to start his own asset management firm, Accessible Real Estate.
                          Nagle is trying to build his assets under management and contacts Papis about gaining
                          some of the retirement fund’s allocation. In the previous few years, the performance

of the retirement fund’s real estate investments was in line with the fund’s benchmark
but was not extraordinary. Papis decides to help out his old friend and also to seek
better returns by moving the real estate allocation to Accessible. The only notice of the
change in adviser appears in the next annual report in the listing of associated advisers.
       Comment: Papis violated Standard V(A). His responsibilities may include
       the selection of the external advisers, but the decision to change advisers
       appears to have been arbitrary. If Papis was dissatisfied with the current
       real estate adviser, he should have conducted a proper solicitation to select
       the most appropriate adviser.

Example 9 (Sufficient Due Diligence):
Andre Shrub owns and operates Conduit, an investment advisory firm. Prior to opening
Conduit, Shrub was an account manager with Elite Investment, a hedge fund man-
aged by his good friend Adam Reed. To attract clients to a new Conduit fund, Shrub
offers lower-than-normal management fees. He can do so because the fund consists
of two top-performing funds managed by Reed. Given his personal friendship with
Reed and the prior performance record of these two funds, Shrub believes this new
fund is a winning combination for all parties. Clients quickly invest with Conduit to
gain access to the Elite funds. No one is turned away because Conduit is seeking to
expand its assets under management.
       Comment: Shrub violated Standard V(A) by not conducting a thorough
       analysis of the funds managed by Reed before developing the new Conduit
       fund. Shrub’s reliance on his personal relationship with Reed and his prior
       knowledge of Elite are insufficient justification for the investments. The
       funds may be appropriately considered, but a full review of their operating
       procedures, reporting practices, and transparency are some elements of
       the necessary due diligence.

Example 10 (Sufficient Due Diligence):
Bob Thompson has been doing research for the portfolio manager of the fixed-income
department. His assignment is to do sensitivity analysis on securitized subprime
mortgages. He has discussed with the manager possible scenarios to use to calculate
expected returns. A key assumption in such calculations is housing price appreciation
(HPA) because it drives “prepays” (prepayments of mortgages) and losses. Thompson
is concerned with the significant appreciation experienced over the previous five years
as a result of the increased availability of funds from subprime mortgages. Thompson
insists that the analysis should include a scenario run with –10% for Year 1, –5% for
Year 2, and then (to project a worst-case scenario) 0% for Years 3 through 5. The
manager replies that these assumptions are too dire because there has never been a
time in their available database when HPA was negative.
    Thompson conducts his research to better understand the risks inherent in these
securities and evaluates these securities in the worst-case scenario, a less likely but
possible environment. Based on the results of the enhanced scenarios, Thompson
does not recommend the purchase of the securitization. Against the general market

                          trends, the manager follows Thompson’s recommendation and does not invest. The
                          following year, the housing market collapses. In avoiding the subprime investments,
                          the manager’s portfolio outperforms its peer group that year.
                                 Comment: Thompson’s actions in running the scenario test with inputs
                                 beyond the historical trends available in the firm’s databases adhere to the
                                 principles of Standard V(A). His concerns over recent trends provide a
                                 sound basis for further analysis. Thompson understands the limitations of
                                 his model, when combined with the limited available historical information,
                                 to accurately predict the performance of the funds if market conditions
                                 change negatively.

                          Example 11 (Use of Quantitatively Oriented Models):
                          Espacia Liakos works in sales for Hellenica Securities, a firm specializing in developing
                          intricate derivative strategies to profit from particular views on market expectations.
                          One of her clients is Eugenie Carapalis, who has become convinced that commodity
                          prices will become more volatile over the coming months. Carapalis asks Liakos to
                          quickly engineer a strategy that will benefit from this expectation. Liakos turns to
                          Hellenica’s modeling group to fulfill this request. Because of the tight deadline, the
                          modeling group outsources parts of the work to several trusted third parties. Liakos
                          implements the disparate components of the strategy as the firms complete them.
                              Within a month, Carapalis is proven correct: Volatility across a range of commod-
                          ities increases sharply. But her derivatives position with Hellenica returns huge losses,
                          and the losses increase daily. Liakos investigates and realizes that although each of the
                          various components of the strategy had been validated, they had never been evalu-
                          ated as an integrated whole. In extreme conditions, portions of the model worked at
                          cross-purposes with other portions, causing the overall strategy to fail dramatically.
                                 Comment: Liakos violated Standard V(A). Members and candidates must
                                 understand the statistical significance of the results of the models they
                                 recommend and must be able to explain them to clients. Liakos did not
                                 take adequate care to ensure a thorough review of the whole model; its
                                 components were evaluated only individually. Because Carapalis clearly
                                 intended to implement the strategy as a whole rather than as separate parts,
                                 Liakos should have tested how the components of the strategy interacted
                                 as well as how they performed individually.



                          Example 12 (Successful Due Diligence/Failed Investment):
                          Alton Newbury is an investment adviser to high-net-worth clients. A client with an
                          aggressive risk profile in his investment policy statement asks about investing in the
                          Top Shelf hedge fund. This fund, based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has reported 20%
                          returns for the first three years. The fund prospectus states that its strategy involves
                          long and short positions in the energy sector and extensive leverage. Based on his
                          analysis of the fund’s track record, the principals involved in managing the fund, the
                          fees charged, and the fund’s risk profile, Newbury recommends the fund to the client
                          and secures a position in it. The next week, the fund announces that it has suffered
                          a loss of 60% of its value and is suspending operations and redemptions until after a
                          regulatory review. Newbury’s client calls him in a panic and asks for an explanation.

       Comment: Newbury’s actions were consistent with Standard V(A). Analysis
       of an investment that results in a reasonable basis for recommendation does
       not guarantee that the investment has no downside risk. Newbury should
       discuss the analysis process with the client while reminding him or her that
       past performance does not lead to guaranteed future gains and that losses
       in an aggressive investment portfolio should be expected.



Example 13 (Quantitative Model Diligence):
Barry Cannon is the lead quantitative analyst at CityCenter Hedge Fund. He is
responsible for the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the proprietary
models the fund uses to manage its investors’ assets. Cannon reads several high-level
mathematical publications and blogs to stay informed of current developments. One
blog, run by “Expert CFA,” presents some intriguing research that may benefit one
of CityCenter’s current models. Cannon is under pressure from firm executives to
improve the model’s predictive abilities, and he incorporates the factors discussed in
the online research. The updated output recommends several new investments to the
fund’s portfolio managers.
       Comment: Cannon has violated Standard V(A) by failing to have a reasonable
       basis for the new recommendations made to the portfolio managers. He
       needed to diligently research the effect of incorporating the new factors
       before offering the output recommendations. Cannon may use the blog
       for ideas, but it is his responsibility to determine the effect on the firm’s
       proprietary models.

Example 14 (Selecting a Service Provider):
Ellen Smith is a performance analyst at Artic Global Advisors, a firm that manages
global equity mandates for institutional clients. She was asked by her supervisor to
review five new performance attribution systems and recommend one that would more
appropriately explain the firm’s investment strategy to clients. On the list was a system
she recalled learning about when visiting an exhibitor booth at a recent conference.
The system is highly quantitative and something of a “black box” in how it calculates
the attribution values. Smith recommended this option without researching the others
because the sheer complexity of the process was sure to impress the clients.
       Comment: Smith’s actions do not demonstrate a sufficient level of dili-
       gence in reviewing this product to make a recommendation for selecting
       the service. Besides not reviewing or considering the other four potential
       systems, she did not determine whether the “black box” attribution process
       aligns with the investment practices of the firm, including its investments
       in different countries and currencies. Smith must review and understand
       the process of any software or system before recommending its use as the
       firm’s attribution system.

                          uses a consultant database to find a list of suitable firms that claim compliance with
                          the GIPS standards. He calls more than 20 firms on the list to confirm their potential
                          interest and to determine their most recent quarterly and annual total return values.
                          Because of the short turnaround, Jackson recommends the firm with the greatest total
                          return values for selection.
                                 Comment: By considering only performance and GIPS compliance, Jackson
                                 has not conducted sufficient review of potential firms to satisfy the require-
                                 ments of Standard V(A). A thorough investigation of the firms and their

                          Example 16 (Manager Selection):
                          Timothy Green works for Peach Asset Management, where he creates proprietary
                          models that analyze data from the firm request for proposal questionnaires to iden-
                          tify managers for possible inclusion in the firm’s fund-of-funds investment platform.
                          Various criteria must be met to be accepted to the platform. Because of the number
                          of respondents to the questionnaires, Green uses only the data submitted to make a
                          recommendation for adding a new manager.
                                 Comment: By failing to conduct any additional outside review of the infor-
                                 mation to verify what was submitted through the request for proposal, Green
                                 has likely not satisfied the requirements of Standard V(A). The amount of
                                 information requested from outside managers varies among firms. Although
                                 the requested information may be comprehensive, Green should ensure
                                 sufficient effort is undertaken to verify the submitted information before
                                 recommending a firm for inclusion. This requires that he goes beyond the
                                 information provided by the manager on the request for proposal ques-
                                 tionnaire and may include interviews with interested managers, reviews of
                                 regulatory filings, and discussions with the managers’ custodian or auditor.



                          Example 17 (Technical Model Requirements):
                          Jérôme Dupont works for the credit research group of XYZ Asset Management, where
                          he is in charge of developing and updating credit risk models. In order to perform
                          accurately, his models need to be regularly updated with the latest market data.
                              Dupont does not interact with or manage money for any of the firm’s clients. He is
                          in contact with the firm’s US corporate bond fund manager, John Smith, who has only
                          very superficial knowledge of the model and who from time to time asks very basic
                          questions regarding the output recommendations. Smith does not consult Dupont
                          with respect to finalizing his clients’ investment strategies.
                              Dupont’s recently assigned objective is to develop a new emerging market corpo-
                          rate credit risk model. The firm is planning to expand into emerging credit, and the
                          development of such a model is a critical step in this process. Because Smith seems
                          to follow the model’s recommendations without much concern for its quality as he
                          develops his clients’ investment strategies, Dupont decides to focus his time on the
                          development of the new emerging market model and neglects to update the US model.
                              After several months without regular updates, Dupont’s diagnostic statistics start
                          to show alarming signs with respect to the quality of the US credit model. Instead
                          of conducting the long and complicated data update, Dupont introduces new codes

into his model with some limited new data as a quick “fix.” He thinks this change will
address the issue without needing to complete the full data update, so he continues
working on the new emerging market model.
    Several months following the quick “fix,” another set of diagnostic statistics reveals
nonsensical results and Dupont realizes that his earlier change contained an error. He
quickly corrects the error and alerts Smith. Smith realizes that some of the prior trades
he performed were due to erroneous model results. Smith rebalances the portfolio
to remove the securities purchased on the basis of the questionable results without
reporting the issue to anyone else.
       Comment: Smith violated Standard V(A) because exercising “diligence, inde-
       pendence, and thoroughness in analyzing investments, making investment
       recommendations, and taking investment actions” means that members
       and candidates must understand the technical aspects of the products they
       provide to clients. Smith does not understand the model he is relying on
       to manage money. Members and candidates should also make reasonable
       enquiries into the source and accuracy of all data used in completing their
       investment analysis and recommendations.
           Dupont violated Standard V(A) even if he does not trade securities or
       make investment decisions. Dupont’s models give investment recommenda-
       tions, and Dupont is accountable for the quality of those recommendations.
       Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to test the output
       of pre-programmed analytical tools they use. Such validation should occur
       before incorporating the tools into their decision-making process.

                          Standard V(B) addresses member and candidate conduct with respect to commu-
                          nicating with clients. Developing and maintaining clear, frequent, and thorough
                          communication practices is critical to providing high-quality financial services to
                          clients. When clients understand the information communicated to them, they also
                          can understand exactly how members and candidates are acting on their behalf, which
                          gives clients the opportunity to make well-informed decisions about their investments.
                          Such understanding can be accomplished only through clear communication.

                          Disclosing Nature of Services and Information about Costs to Clients and Prospective
                          Clients
                          A fundamental goal of the Code and Standards is to protect client interests and
                          allow clients to make fully informed decisions about their investments and financial
                          well-being. Providing clients with a description of the nature of the services they can
                          expect from investment professionals and information about the costs to the client for
                          those services is critical to achieving this goal. The disclosures required by Standard
                          V(B) will permit clients to make informed decisions as to whether to engage in pro-
                          fessional services with members or candidates or their firms.
                              Full and fair disclosure builds trust with clients, and the disclosure of information
                          about costs benefits clients and protects their interests. Standard V(B) makes clear
                          that required disclosures cover all professional services provided by members and
                          candidates. A clear understanding of the services that members and candidates provide
                          is a foundational element of the client relationship. Clients must understand what
                          services the member or candidate will provide and, critically, what services will not be
                          provided so that members and candidates can set appropriate expectations. It is best
                          practice for members and candidates with client-facing responsibilities to clearly set
                          out in written form at the outset of the engagement a description of the nature and
                          parameters of the professional services as part of the engagement agreement, contract,
                          or other documents memorializing the terms of the client relationship.
                              In addition to understanding the nature of the services, clients must understand
                          the cost they will be expected to pay for those services so they can make informed
                          decisions about the professional services being provided. This standard requires
                          members and candidates to inform their clients and prospective clients about the
                          services they will receive and the associated costs. Disclosures regarding the cost of
                          the services to clients mandated by Standard V(B) are those expected to be charged
                    © CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.

to and paid for by the client. Members and candidates should provide a reasonable
amount of detail regarding the costs incurred by clients. The standard, however, does
not require members and candidates to provide specific dollar amounts. For example,
a firm that charges clients a quarterly fee based on the market value of assets under
management will be unable to specify a dollar amount in advance. Members and
candidates are also not required to disclose a description of the costs to the firm of
providing those services. Again, best practice is for members and candidates with
client-facing responsibilities to disclose information about the nature of the services
and the related costs at the outset of the relationship as part of the client agreement.
     The disclosure responsibilities of members and candidates under this standard are
ongoing. Initial disclosures at the outset of the relationship alone may not meet the
requirements of the standard. If the services or costs change, members and candidates
must update the disclosures and provide the updated information to all impacted
clients and prospective clients on a timely basis.
     In addition, the scope of the disclosures is not limited to only those costs charged
by the entity with which the client is in a direct relationship. Members and candidates
with client-facing responsibilities must provide disclosures about all of the costs that
are associated with the investment services and products that are provided to the client.
This includes information on costs arising out of services provided by affiliates, related
entities, or third parties for products and services utilized by members, candidates,
or their firms in providing their services to clients. Members and candidates may not
rely on the sophistication of clients and their supposed understanding of the nature
and details of the investment process as a reason for not providing the information
required by this standard. However, the information may be tailored to the knowledge
and sophistication of each individual client.
     The manner in which members and candidates provide the disclosures required
by Standard V(B) is at their individual discretion so long as the disclosures are appro-
priate, accurate, timely, and complete. Best practice dictates that such disclosures be
made in written form. Often, in large firms, disclosures about charges to and payments
expected by clients are dictated by firm policy and practice. However, this does not
relieve members or candidates of their responsibility to provide this information when
that is part of their professional responsibilities. While members and candidates rely
on and can be directed to use firm-generated disclosures, members and candidates
should ensure that these disclosures meet the requirements of the Code and Standards.
They have the responsibility to call to their firm’s attention when the communication
is lacking, flawed, or insufficient to meet the members’ and candidates’ responsibilities
under the Code and Standards. In such a case, members and candidates should, when
possible, supplement disclosures from the firm that they consider insufficient to meet
the requirements of this standard. Ultimately, if members or candidates cannot rectify
or supplement inadequate disclosures mandated by the firm, they should document
their objections and take steps to dissociate from the activity.
     Generally, this standard affects only client-facing members. While CFA Institute
encourages all investment professionals to help ensure that clients receive sufficient
disclosures, the standard does not impose a duty on members and candidates who do
not interact with clients to ensure that others, not subject to the Code and Standards,
comply with Standard V(B). As with other standards that may not be applicable to
the professional responsibilities of all members and candidates (e.g., investment
performance, suitability), those members and candidates who are part of a team of
investment professionals providing services to clients but who do not have client-facing
responsibilities need not expand their realm of responsibility to ensure appropriate
disclosures to clients are made regarding the nature of services and the associated costs.

                          Informing Clients of the Investment Process
                          Members and candidates must adequately describe to clients and prospective clients
                          the manner in which they conduct the investment decision-making process. Such
                          disclosure should address factors that have positive and negative influences on the
                          recommendations, including significant risks and limitations of the investment pro-
                          cess used. The member or candidate must keep clients and other interested parties
                          informed on an ongoing basis about changes to the investment process, especially
                          newly identified significant risks and limitations. Only by thoroughly understanding
                          the nature of the investment product or service can a client determine whether changes
                          to that product or service could materially affect his or her investment objectives.
                              Understanding the basic characteristics of an investment is of great importance
                          in judging the suitability of that investment on a standalone basis, but it is especially
                          important in determining the impact each investment will have on the characteristics
                          of a portfolio. Although the risk and return characteristics of a common stock might
                          seem to be essentially the same for any investor when the stock is viewed in isolation,
                          the effects of those characteristics greatly depend on the other investments held. For
                          instance, if the particular stock will represent 90% of an individual’s investments,
                          the stock’s importance in the portfolio is vastly different from what it would be to
                          an investor with a highly diversified portfolio for whom the stock will represent only
                          2% of the holdings.
                              A firm’s investment policy may include the use of outside advisers to manage var-
                          ious portions of clients’ assets under management. Members and candidates should
                          inform the clients about the specialization or diversification expertise provided by
                          the external adviser(s). This information allows clients to understand the full mix of
                          products and strategies being applied that may affect their investment objectives.

                          Different Forms of Communication
                          For purposes of Standard V(B), communication is not confined to a written report
                          of the type traditionally generated by an analyst researching a security, company, or
                          industry. A presentation of information can be made via any means of communication,
                          including in-person recommendation or description, telephone conversation, media
                          broadcast, or transmission by computer (e.g., on the internet).
                              Computer and mobile device communications have rapidly evolved over the past
                          few years. Members and candidates using any social media service to communicate
                          business information must be diligent in their efforts to avoid unintended problems
                          because these services may not be available to all clients. When providing information
                          to clients through new technologies, members and candidates should take reasonable
                          steps to ensure that such delivery would treat all clients fairly and, if necessary, be
                          considered publicly disseminated.
                              The nature of client communications is highly diverse—from one word (“buy” or
                          “sell”) to in-depth reports of more than 100 pages. A communication may contain a
                          general recommendation about the market, asset allocations, or classes of investments
                          (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) or may relate to a specific security. If recommenda-
                          tions are contained in capsule form (such as a recommended stock list), members and
                          candidates should notify clients that additional information and analyses are available
                          from the producer of the report.

                          Identifying Risks and Limitations
                          Members and candidates must outline to clients and prospective clients significant
                          risks and limitations of the analysis contained in their investment products or recom-
                          mendations. The type and nature of significant risks will depend on the investment

process that members and candidates are following and on the personal circumstances
of the client. In general, the use of leverage constitutes a significant risk and should
be disclosed.
    Members and candidates must adequately disclose the general market-related
risks and the risks associated with the use of complex financial instruments that are
deemed significant. Other types of risks that members and candidates may consider
disclosing include, but are not limited to, counterparty risk, country risk, sector or
industry risk, security-specific risk, and credit risk.
    Investment securities and vehicles may have limiting factors that influence a
client’s or potential client’s investment decision. Members and candidates must
report to clients and prospective clients the existence of limitations significant to the
decision-making process. Examples of such factors and attributes include, but are not
limited to, investment liquidity and capacity. Liquidity is the ability to liquidate an
investment on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Capacity is the investment amount
beyond which returns will be negatively affected by new investments.
    The appropriateness of risk disclosure should be assessed on the basis of what was
known at the time the investment action was taken (often called an ex ante basis).
Members and candidates must disclose significant risks known to them at the time
of the disclosure. Members and candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they
are unaware of at the time recommendations or investment actions are made. In
assessing compliance with Standard V(B), it is important to establish knowledge of a
purported significant risk or limitation. A one-time investment loss that occurs after
the disclosure does not constitute a pertinent factor in assessing whether significant
risks and limitations were properly disclosed. Having no knowledge of a risk or lim-
itation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and
reasonable basis of the research of the member or candidate but may not reveal a
breach of Standard V(B).

Report Presentation
Once the analytical process has been completed, the member or candidate who prepares
the report must include those elements that are important to the analysis and conclu-
sions of the report so that the reader can follow and challenge the report’s reasoning.
A report writer who has done adequate investigation may emphasize certain areas,
touch briefly on others, and omit certain aspects deemed unimportant. For instance,
a report may dwell on a quarterly earnings release or new-product introduction and
omit other matters as long as the analyst clearly stipulates the limits to the scope of
the report.
    Investment advice based on quantitative research and analysis must be supported
by readily available reference material and should be applied in a manner consistent
with previously applied methodology. If changes in methodology are made, they
should be highlighted.

Distinction between Facts and Opinions in Reports
Standard V(B) requires that opinion be separated from fact. Violations often occur
when reports fail to separate the past from the future by not indicating that earnings
estimates, changes in the outlook for dividends, or future market price information
are opinions subject to future circumstances.
    In the case of complex quantitative analyses, members and candidates must clearly
separate fact from statistical conjecture and should identify the known limitations of
an analysis. Members and candidates may violate Standard V(B) by failing to identify

                              Members and candidates should explicitly discuss with clients and prospective
                          clients the assumptions used in the investment models and processes to generate the
                          analysis. Caution should be used in promoting the perceived accuracy of any model or
                          process to clients because the ultimate output is merely an estimate of future results
                          and not a certainty.




            49            STANDARD V(B): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                          Because the selection of relevant factors is an analytical skill, determination of whether
                          a member or candidate has used reasonable judgment in excluding and including
                          information in research reports depends heavily on case-by-case review rather than
                          a specific checklist.
                              Members and candidates should encourage their firms to have a rigorous methodol-
                          ogy for reviewing research that is created for publication and dissemination to clients.
                              To assist in the after-the-fact review of a report, the member or candidate must
                          maintain records indicating the nature of the research and should, if asked, be able to
                          supply additional information to the client (or any user of the report) covering factors
                          not included in the report.




            50            STANDARD V(B): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                          Example 1 (Costs of Services to Clients):
                          The nature of ABC Capital Private Equity Fund III’s investments requires ABC Capital
                          to routinely provide structuring advice to the companies in which the fund invests, for
                          which ABC Capital charges a fee to those companies. It is the policy of ABC Capital
                          to remit the fees it earns for restructuring advice to the fund if the investment in the
                          underlying company decreases in value, but it retains the fees if the investment in the
                          underlying company increases in value. The private placement memorandum does
                          not disclose this arrangement because the firm’s CEO, Alex Alphonso, views this as a
                          common industry practice and that it provides a “win-win” for investors. ABC Capital’s
                          services contribute significantly to the returns enjoyed by investors in the ABC Capital
                          Private Equity Fund III, and ABC Capital earns a substantial fee.
                                 Comment: Alphonso is in violation of Standard V(B) because the com-
                                 pensation received by ABC Capital has not been disclosed to clients who
                                 are investors in the fund. Alphonso may not rely on the sophistication of
                                 clients and their assumed understanding of the nature and details of the
                                 fee arrangements with underlying companies in which ABC Capital invests
                                 in as a reason for not providing the information required by this standard.
                                 This is true even though investors in ABC Private Equity Fund III benefit
                                 from the arrangement.



                          Example 2 (Costs of Services to Clients):
                          January James is an investment adviser tasked with completing a manager search for a
                          client’s portfolio. The search mandate is to identify a shortlist of investment managers
                          who offer core fixed-income strategies managed to the benchmark identified in the

client’s investment policy statement. James begins her search with a set of criteria
defined by her firm’s manager research process policy. She identifies three candidates
who fulfill these criteria but notices that her top-ranked manager has significantly
higher fees than the other candidates on her list. Her firm’s search criteria list fees as
less important relative to the other criteria for ranking investment managers. To present
investment performance for uniform comparison, James creates a fee comparison chart
that lists each manager’s performance on a gross-of-fee basis. She presents gross-of-fee
performance over the same time periods and relative to the same benchmark. She
also calculates the total amount of fees that would have been paid during each of the
performance time periods presented. Finally, she lists each manager’s fee schedule
and any additional fees that may be charged outside the published fees. She explains
to her client that prior to final selection, the investment managers will be required to
present their final fee proposal.
       Comment: James’s presentation of manager fees is appropriate because
       she provided a uniform comparison of manager services. Her presentation
       adheres to Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective
       Clients, which requires disclosure about the nature of services provided,
       along with information about the cost associated with those services.



Example 3 (Disclosure of Changed Fee Calculation
Methodology):
Marc Maalouf works in a branch office for a large wealth management firm. The
firm’s fees are based on a percentage of the value of the assets managed in each client
account. The firm has a standard method for valuing assets and calculating fees for all
of its clients, which is disclosed to each client at the outset of the relationship. Maalouf
becomes aware that, over time, the firm has transitioned to (1) using the market value
of client assets at the end of the billing cycle instead of the average daily balance of
the account and (2) including cash and cash equivalents in the fee calculation, which
were previously excluded.
       Comment: Advisory fees are critical information that a client needs to know.
       Developing and maintaining clear, frequent, and thorough communication
       with clients about costs for the investment adviser’s services allows them
       to make well-informed decisions about their investments, including about
       whether to engage or retain an investment adviser. Maalouf and his firm
       may change the advisory fee calculation methodology and policies over
       time for existing accounts, but Maalouf must make clients aware of any
       such changes. It is improper to change fee calculation methodology without
       disclosure, even if it results in lower fees.



Example 4 (Sufficient Disclosure of Investment System):
Sarah Williamson, director of marketing for Country Technicians, Inc., is convinced
that she has found the perfect formula for increasing Country Technicians’ income
and diversifying its product base. Williamson plans to build on Country Technicians’
reputation as a leading money manager by marketing an exclusive and expensive
investment advice letter to high-net-worth individuals. One hitch in the plan is the
complexity of Country Technicians’ investment system—a combination of technical
trading rules (based on historical price and volume fluctuations) and portfolio con-
struction rules designed to minimize risk. To simplify the newsletter, she decides to
include only each week’s top five “buy” and “sell” recommendations and to leave out
details of the valuation models and the portfolio structuring scheme.

                                 Comment: Williamson’s plans for the newsletter violate Standard V(B).
                                 Williamson need not describe the investment system in detail in order to
                                 implement the advice effectively, but she must inform clients of Country
                                 Technicians’ basic process and logic. Without understanding the basis for
                                 a recommendation, clients cannot possibly understand its limitations or
                                 its inherent risks.



                          Example 5 (Providing Opinions as Facts):
                          Richard Dox is a mining analyst for East Bank Securities. He has just finished his report
                          on Boisy Bay Minerals. Included in his report is his own assessment of the geological
                          extent of mineral reserves likely to be found on the company’s land. Dox completed
                          this calculation on the basis of the core samples from the company’s latest drilling.
                          According to Dox’s calculations, the company has more than 500,000 ounces of gold
                          on the property. Dox concludes his research report as follows: “Based on the fact that
                          the company has 500,000 ounces of gold to be mined, I recommend a strong buy.”
                                 Comment: If Dox issues the report as written, he will violate Standard
                                 V(B). His calculation of the total gold reserves for the property based on
                                 the company’s recent sample drilling is a quantitative opinion, not a fact.
                                 Opinion must be distinguished from fact in research reports.



                          Example 6 (Proper Description of a Security):
                          Olivia Thomas, an analyst at Government Brokers, Inc., which is a brokerage firm
                          specializing in government bond trading, has produced a report that describes an
                          investment strategy designed to benefit from an expected decline in US interest rates.
                          The firm’s derivative products group has designed a structured product that will allow
                          the firm’s clients to benefit from this strategy. Thomas’s report describing the strategy
                          indicates that high returns are possible if various scenarios for declining interest rates
                          are assumed. Citing the proprietary nature of the structured product underlying the
                          strategy, the report does not describe in detail how the firm is able to offer such returns
                          or the related risks in the scenarios, nor does the report address the likely returns of
                          the strategy if, contrary to expectations, interest rates rise.
                                 Comment: Thomas has violated Standard V(B) because her report fails to
                                 describe properly the basic characteristics of the actual and implied risks
                                 of the investment strategy, including how the structure was created and
                                 the degree to which leverage was embedded in the structure. The report
                                 should include a balanced discussion of how the strategy would perform
                                 in the case of rising as well as falling interest rates, preferably illustrating
                                 how the strategies might be expected to perform in the event of a reason-
                                 able variety of interest rate– and credit risk–spread scenarios. If liquidity
                                 issues are relevant with regard to the valuation of either the derivatives or
                                 the underlying securities, provisions the firm has made to address those
                                 risks should also be disclosed.



                          Example 7 (Notification of Fund Mandate Change):
                          May & Associates is an aggressive growth manager that has represented itself since
                          its inception as a specialist at investing in small-cap US stocks. One of May’s selection
                          criteria is a maximum capitalization of US$250 million for any given company. After
                          a string of successful years of superior performance relative to its peers, May has

expanded its client base significantly, to the point at which assets under management
now exceed US$3 billion. For liquidity purposes, May’s chief investment officer (CIO)
decides to lift the maximum permissible market-cap ceiling to US$500 million and
change the firm’s sales and marketing literature accordingly to inform prospective
clients and third-party consultants.
       Comment: Although May’s CIO is correct about informing potentially
       interested parties as to the change in investment process, he must also
       notify May’s existing clients. Among the latter group might be a number of
       clients who not only retained May as a small-cap manager but also retained
       mid-cap and large-cap specialists in a multiple-manager approach. Such
       clients could regard May’s change of criteria as a style change that distorts
       their overall asset allocations.



Example 8 (Notification of Fund Mandate Change):
Rather than lifting the ceiling for its universe from US$250 million to US$500 million,
May & Associates extends its small-cap universe to include a number of non-US
companies.
       Comment: Standard V(B) requires that May’s CIO advise May’s clients of
       this change because the firm may have been retained by some clients spe-
       cifically for its prowess at investing in US small-cap stocks. Other changes
       that require client notification are introducing derivatives to emulate a
       certain market sector or relaxing various other constraints, such as portfolio
       beta. In all such cases, members and candidates must disclose changes to
       all interested parties.



Example 9 (Notification of Changes to the Investment Process):
RJZ Capital Management is an active value style equity manager that selects stocks by
using a combination of four multifactor models. The firm has found favorable results
when backtesting the most recent 10 years of available market data in a new dividend
discount model (DDM) designed by the firm. This model is based on projected inflation
rates, earnings growth rates, and interest rates. The president of RJZ decides to replace
its simple model that uses price to trailing 12-month earnings with the new DDM.
       Comment: Because the introduction of a new and different valuation model
       represents a material change in the investment process, RJZ’s president
       must communicate the change to the firm’s clients. RJZ is moving away
       from a model based on hard data toward a new model that is at least partly
       dependent on the firm’s forecasting skills. Clients would likely view such a
       model as a significant change rather than a mere refinement of RJZ’s process.



Example 10 (Notification of Changes to the Investment
Process):
RJZ Capital Management loses the chief architect of its multifactor valuation system.
Without informing its clients, the president of RJZ decides to redirect the firm’s tal-
ents and resources toward developing a product for passive equity management—a
product that will emulate the performance of a major market index.
       Comment: By failing to disclose to clients a substantial change to its invest-
       ment process, the president of RJZ has violated Standard V(B).

                          Process):
                          At Fundamental Asset Management, Inc., the responsibility for selecting stocks for
                          addition to the firm’s “approved” list has just shifted from individual security analysts
                          to a committee consisting of the research director and three senior portfolio managers.
                          Eleanor Morales, a portfolio manager with Fundamental Asset Management, thinks
                          this change is not important enough to communicate to her clients.
                                 Comment: Morales must disclose the process change to all her clients.
                                 Some of Fundamental’s clients might be concerned about the morale and
                                 motivation among the firm’s best research analysts after such a change.
                                 Moreover, clients might challenge the stock-picking track record of the
                                 portfolio managers and might even want to monitor the situation closely.



                          Example 12 (Sufficient Disclosure of Investment System):
                          Amanda Chinn is the investment director for Diversified Asset Management, which
                          manages the endowment of a charitable organization. Because of recent staff depar-
                          tures, Diversified has decided to limit its direct investment focus to large-cap securities
                          and supplement the needs for small-cap and mid-cap management by hiring outside
                          fund managers. In describing the planned strategy change to the charity, Chinn’s
                          update letter states, “As investment director, I will directly oversee the investment
                          team managing the endowment’s large-capitalization allocation. I will coordinate
                          the selection and ongoing review of external managers responsible for allocations to
                          classes.” The letter also describes the reasons for the change and the characteristics
                          external managers must have to be considered.
                                 Comment: Standard V(B) requires the disclosure of the investment pro-
                                 cess used to construct the portfolio of the fund. Changing the investment
                                 process from managing all classes of investments within the firm to the
                                 use of external managers is one example of information that needs to be
                                 communicated to clients. Chinn and her firm have embraced the principles
                                 of Standard V(B) by providing their client with relevant information. The
                                 charity can now make a reasonable decision about whether Diversified
                                 Asset Management remains the appropriate manager for its fund.



                          Example 13 (Notification of Changes to the Investment
                          Process):
                          Michael Papis is the chief investment officer of his state’s retirement fund. The fund
                          has always used outside advisers for the real estate allocation, and this information is
                          clearly presented in all fund communications. Thomas Nagle, a recognized sell-side
                          research analyst and Papis’s business school classmate, recently left the investment
                          bank he worked for to start his own asset management firm, Accessible Real Estate.
                          Nagle is trying to build his assets under management and contacts Papis about gaining
                          some of the retirement fund’s allocation. In the previous few years, the performance
                          of the retirement fund’s real estate investments was in line with the fund’s benchmark
                          but was not extraordinary. Papis decides to help out his old friend and also to seek
                          better returns by moving the real estate allocation to Accessible. The only notice of the
                          change in adviser appears in the next annual report in the listing of associated advisers.

       Comment: Papis has violated Standard V(B). He attempted to hide the nature
       of his decision to change external managers by making only a limited dis-
       closure. The plan recipients and the fund’s trustees need to be aware when
       changes are made to ensure that operational procedures are being followed.

Example 14 (Notification of Errors):
Jérôme Dupont works for the credit research group of XYZ Asset Management, where
he is in charge of developing and updating credit risk models. In order to perform
accurately, his models need to be regularly updated with the latest market data.
    Dupont does not interact with or manage money for any of the firm’s clients. He is
in contact with the firm’s US corporate bond fund manager, John Smith, who has only
very superficial knowledge of the model and who from time to time asks very basic
questions regarding the output recommendations. Smith does not consult Dupont
with respect to finalizing his clients’ investment strategies.
    Dupont’s recently assigned objective is to develop a new emerging market corpo-
rate credit risk model. The firm is planning to expand into emerging credit, and the
development of such a model is a critical step in this process. Because Smith seems
to follow the model’s recommendations without much concern for its quality as he
develops his clients’ investment strategies, Dupont decides to focus his time on the
development of the new emerging market model and neglects to update the US model.
    After several months without regular updates, Dupont’s diagnostic statistics start
to show alarming signs with respect to the quality of the US credit model. Instead
of conducting the long and complicated data update, Dupont introduces new codes
into his model with some limited new data as a quick “fix.” He thinks this change will
address the issue without needing to complete the full data update, so he continues
working on the new emerging market model.
    Several months following the quick “fix,” another set of diagnostic statistics reveals
nonsensical results and Dupont realizes that his earlier change contained an error. He
quickly corrects the error and alerts Smith. Smith realizes that some of the prior trades
he performed were due to erroneous model results. Smith rebalances the portfolio to
remove the securities purchased based on the questionable results without reporting
the issue to anyone else.
       Comment: Smith violated V(B) by not disclosing a material error in the
       investment process. Clients should have been informed about the error
       and the corrective actions the firm was undertaking on their behalf.

Example 15 (Notification of Risks and Limitations):
Quantitative analyst Yuri Yakovlev has developed an investment strategy that selects
small-cap stocks on the basis of quantitative signals. Yakovlev’s strategy typically
identifies only a small number of stocks (10–20) that tend to be illiquid, but according
to his backtests, the strategy generates significant risk-adjusted returns. The partners
at Yakovlev’s firm, QSC Capital, are impressed by these results. After a thorough
examination of the strategy’s risks, stress testing, historical backtesting, and scenario
analysis, QSC decides to seed the strategy with US$10 million of internal capital in
order for Yakovlev to create a track record for the strategy.

                             After two years, the strategy has generated performance returns greater than the
                          appropriate benchmark and the Sharpe ratio of the fund is close to 1.0. On the basis of
                          these results, QSC decides to actively market the fund to large institutional investors.
                          While creating the offering materials, Yakovlev informs the marketing team that the
                          capacity of the strategy is limited. The extent of the limitation is difficult to ascertain
                          with precision; it depends on market liquidity and other factors in his model that
                          can evolve over time. Yakovlev indicates that given the current market conditions,
                          investments in the fund beyond US$100 million of capital could become more difficult
                          and negatively affect expected fund returns.
                             Alan Wellard, the manager of the marketing team, is a partner with 30 years of
                          marketing experience and explains to Yakovlev that these are complex technical issues
                          that will muddy the marketing message. According to Wellard, the offering material
                          should focus solely on the great track record of the fund. Yakovlev does not object
                          because the fund, with US$12 million of capital, is very far from the US$100 million
                          threshold.
                                 Comment: Yakovlev and Wellard have not appropriately disclosed a signif-
                                 icant limitation associated with the investment product. Yakovlev believes
                                 this limitation, once reached, will materially affect the returns of the fund.
                                 While the fund is currently far from the US$100 million mark, current
                                 and prospective investors must be made aware of this capacity issue. If
                                 significant limitations are complicated to grasp and clients do not have the
                                 technical background required to understand them, Yakovlev and Wellard
                                 should either educate the clients or ascertain whether the fund is suitable
                                 for each client.



                          Example 16 (Notification of Risks and Limitations):
                          Brickell Advisers offers investment advisory services mainly to South American clients.
                          Julietta Ramon, a risk analyst at Brickell, describes to clients how the firm uses value at
                          risk (VaR) analysis to track the risk of its strategies. Ramon assures clients that calcu-
                          lating a VaR at a 99% confidence level, using a 20-day holding period, and applying a
                          methodology based on an ex ante Monte Carlo simulation is extremely effective. The
                          firm has never had losses greater than those predicted by this VaR analysis.
                                 Comment: Ramon has not sufficiently communicated the risks associated
                                 with the investment process to satisfy the requirements of Standard V(B).
                                 The losses predicted by a VaR analysis depend greatly on the inputs used
                                 in the model. The size and probability of losses can differ significantly from
                                 what an individual model predicts. Ramon must disclose how the inputs
                                 were selected and the potential limitations and risks associated with the
                                 investment strategy.



                          Example 17 (Notification of Risks and Limitations):
                          Lily Smith attended an industry conference and noticed that John Baker, an invest-
                          ment manager with Baker Associates, attracted a great deal of attention from the
                          conference participants. On the basis of her knowledge of Baker’s reputation and the
                          interest he received at the conference, Smith recommends adding Baker Associates
                          to the approved manager platform. Her recommendation to the approval committee
                          included the statement “John Baker is well respected in the industry, and his insights
                          are consistently sought after by investors. Our clients are sure to benefit from investing
                          with Baker Associates.”

       Comment: Smith is not appropriately separating facts from opinions in her
       recommendation to include the manager within the platform. Her actions
       conflict with the requirements of Standard V(B). Smith is relying on her
       opinions about Baker’s reputation and the fact that many attendees were
       talking with him at the conference. Smith should also review the require-

       of review necessary to recommend Baker Associates.

Guidance

Highlights:

   ■   New Media Records
   ■   Records Are Property of the Firm
   ■   Local Requirements
Members and candidates must retain records that substantiate the scope of their
research and reasons for their actions or conclusions. The retention requirement
applies to decisions to buy or sell a security as well as reviews undertaken that do
not lead to a change in position. Which records are required to support recommen-
dations or investment actions depends on the role of the member or candidate in the
investment decision-making process. Records may be maintained either in hard copy
or electronic form.
    Some examples of supporting documentation that assists the member or candidate
in meeting the requirements for retention are as follows:
   ■   personal notes from meetings with the covered company,
   ■   press releases or presentations issued by the covered company,
   ■   computer-based model outputs and analyses,
   ■   computer-based model input parameters,
   ■   risk analyses of securities’ impacts on a portfolio,
   ■   selection criteria for external advisers,

                          New Media Records
                          The increased use of new and evolving technological formats (e.g., social media) for
                          gathering and sharing information creates new challenges in maintaining the appro-
                          priate records and files. The nature or format of the information does not remove a
                          member’s or candidate’s responsibility to maintain a record of information used in
                          his or her analysis or communicated to clients.
                              Members and candidates should understand that although employers and local
                          regulators are developing digital media retention policies, these policies may lag behind
                          the advent of new communication channels. Such lag places greater responsibility
                          on the individual for ensuring that all relevant information is retained. Examples
                          of non-print media formats that should be retained include, but are not limited to,
                              ■   e-mails,
                              ■   text messages,
                              ■   blog posts, and
                              ■   social media posts.


                          Records Are Property of the Firm
                          As a general matter, records created as part of a member’s or candidate’s professional
                          activity on behalf of his or her employer are the property of the firm. When a mem-
                          ber or candidate leaves a firm to seek other employment, the member or candidate
                          cannot take the property of the firm, including original forms or copies of supporting
                          records of the member’s or candidate’s work, to the new employer without the express
                          consent of the previous employer. The member or candidate cannot use historical
                          recommendations or research reports created at the previous firm because the sup-
                          porting documentation is unavailable. For future use, the member or candidate must
                          re-create the supporting records at the new firm with information gathered through
                          public sources or directly from the covered company and not from memory or sources
                          obtained at the previous employer.

                          Local Requirements
                          Local regulators often impose requirements on members, candidates, and their firms
                          related to record retention that must be followed. Firms may also implement policies
                          detailing the applicable time frame for retaining research and client communication
                          records. Fulfilling such regulatory and firm requirements satisfies the requirements of
                          Standard V(C). In the absence of regulatory guidance or firm policies, CFA Institute
                          recommends maintaining records for at least seven years.




            52            STANDARD V(C): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                          The responsibility to maintain records that support investment action generally falls
                          with the firm rather than individuals. Members and candidates must, however, archive
                          research notes and other documents, either electronically or in hard copy, that support
                          their current investment-related communications. Doing so will assist their firms in
                          complying with requirements for preservation of internal or external records.

Example 1 (Record Retention and IPS Objectives and
Recommendations):
One of Nikolas Lindstrom’s clients is upset by the negative investment returns of his
equity portfolio. The investment policy statement for the client requires that the port-
folio manager follow a benchmark-oriented approach. The benchmark for the client
includes a 35% investment allocation in the technology sector. The client acknowl-
edges that this allocation was appropriate, but over the past three years, technology
stocks have suffered severe losses. The client complains to the investment manager
for allocating so much money to this sector.
       Comment: For Lindstrom, having appropriate records is important to
       show that over the past three years, the portion of technology stocks in
       the benchmark index was 35%, as called for in the IPS. Lindstrom should
       also have the client’s IPS stating that the benchmark was appropriate for
       the client’s investment objectives. He should also have records indicating
       that the investment has been explained appropriately to the client and that
       the IPS was updated on a regular basis. Taking these actions, Lindstrom
       would be in compliance with Standard V(C).



Example 2 (Record Retention and Research Process):
Malcolm Young is a research analyst who writes numerous reports rating companies
in the luxury retail industry. His reports are based on a variety of sources, including
interviews with company managers, manufacturers, and economists; on-site com-
pany visits; customer surveys; and secondary research from analysts covering related
industries.
       Comment: Young must carefully document and keep copies of all the infor-
       mation that goes into his reports, including the secondary or third-party
       research of other analysts. Failure to maintain such files would violate
       Standard V(C).



Example 3 (Records as Firm, Not Employee, Property):
Martin Blank develops an analytical model while he is employed by Green Partners
Investment Management, LLP (GPIM). While at the firm, he systematically docu-
ments the assumptions that make up the model as well as his reasoning behind the
assumptions. As a result of the success of his model, Blank is hired to be the head
of the research department of one of GPIM’s competitors. Blank takes copies of the
records supporting his model to his new firm.
       Comment: The records created by Blank supporting the research model he
       developed at GPIM are the records of GPIM. Taking the documents with
       him to his new employer without GPIM’s permission violates Standard
       V(C). To use the model in the future, Blank must re-create the records
       supporting his model at the new firm.

                          or her professional responsibilities in an independent and objective manner. Conflicts
                          of interest often arise in the investment profession. Conflicts can occur between the
                          interests of clients, the interests of employers, and the member’s or candidate’s own
                          personal interests. Common sources for conflict are compensation structures, espe-
                          cially incentive and bonus structures that provide immediate returns for members and
                          candidates with little or no consideration of long-term value creation. Identifying and
                          managing conflicts of interest is critically important to engaging in ethical conduct.
                              Best practice is to avoid actual conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest.
                          When it is not reasonable for members and candidates to avoid a conflict, clear and
                          complete disclosure to mitigate the conflict is necessary.
                              Standard VI(A) protects investors and employers by requiring members and
                          candidates to avoid or fully disclose to clients, potential clients, and employers all
                          actual and potential conflicts of interest. When a member or candidate has made full

Standard VI: Conflicts of Interest                                                          197


disclosure of an unavoidable conflict, the member’s or candidate’s employer, clients,
and prospective clients will have the information needed to evaluate the objectivity
of the investment advice or action taken on their behalf.
    To be effective, disclosures must be prominent and must be made in plain language
and in a manner designed to effectively communicate the information. Members and
candidates are responsible for determining how often, in what manner, and in what
particular circumstances the disclosure of conflicts must be made. Best practice dictates
updating disclosures when the nature of a conflict of interest changes materially—for
example, if the nature of a conflict of interest worsens through the introduction of
bonuses based on each quarter’s profits as opposed to annual profits. In making and
updating disclosures of conflicts of interest, members and candidates should err on
the side of caution to ensure that conflicts are effectively communicated.

Disclosure of Conflicts to Employers
Disclosure of conflicts to employers may be appropriate in many instances. When
reporting conflicts of interest to employers, members and candidates must give their
employers enough information to assess the impact of the conflict. By complying
with employer guidelines, members and candidates allow their employers to avoid
potentially embarrassing and costly ethical or regulatory violations.
     						Reportable situations include con-
flicts that would interfere with rendering unbiased investment advice and conflicts
that would cause a member or candidate to act not in the employer’s best interest. The
same circumstances that generate conflicts to be reported to clients and prospective
clients also dictate reporting to employers. Ownership of stocks analyzed or recom-
mended, participation on outside boards, and financial or other pressures that could
influence a decision are to be promptly reported to the employer so that their impact
can be assessed and a decision on how to resolve the conflict can be made.
     						                                             The mere appearance of a con-
flict of interest may create problems for members, candidates, and their employers.
Therefore, many of the conflicts previously mentioned may be explicitly prohibited by
an employer in order to avoid those conflicts altogether. For example, many employers
restrict personal trading, outside board membership, and related activities to prevent
situations that might not normally be considered problematic from a conflict-of-interest
point of view but that could give the appearance of a conflict of interest. Members
and candidates must comply with these employer restrictions. Members and candi-
dates should take reasonable steps to avoid conflicts. However, if the conflicts are not
resolved, they must report conflicts promptly.
     Standard VI(A) also deals with a member’s or candidate’s conflicts of interest that
might be detrimental to the employer’s business. Any potential conflict situation that
could prevent clear judgment about or full commitment to the execution of a member’s
or candidate’s duties to the employer should be avoided. If the member or candidate
does not avoid the conflict, it must be reported to the member’s or candidate’s employer.

Disclosure of Conflicts to Clients
Members and candidates must maintain their objectivity when rendering investment
advice or taking investment action. Investment advice or actions may be perceived to
be tainted in numerous situations. For instance, a member or candidate may not be
objective if he or she owns stock in the company that is the subject of an investment
recommendation or if the member or candidate has a close personal relationship with
the company managers. Requiring members and candidates to disclose all matters
that reasonably could be expected to impair the member’s or candidate’s objectivity
when a conflict exists mitigates the conflict and allows clients and prospective clients
to judge motives and possible biases for themselves.

                               While avoiding conflicts altogether is preferred, often in the investment industry,
                          a conflict or the perception of a conflict is not reasonably avoidable. The most obvi-
                          ous conflicts of interest, which must always be avoided or disclosed, are relationships
                          between an issuer and the member, the candidate, or his or her firm (such as a direc-
                          torship or consultancy by a member; investment banking, underwriting, and financial
                          relationships; broker/dealer market-making activities; and material beneficial ownership
                          of stock). For the purposes of Standard VI(A), members and candidates beneficially
                          own securities or other investments if they have a direct or indirect pecuniary inter-
                          est in the securities, have the power to vote or direct the voting of the shares of the
                          securities or investments, or have the power to dispose or direct the disposition of
                          the security or investment.
                               A member or candidate must take reasonable steps to determine whether a con-
                          flict of interest exists and disclose to clients any known conflicts of the member’s or
                          candidate’s firm. As an example, disclosure of broker/dealer market-making activities
                          alerts clients that a purchase or sale might be made from or to the firm’s proprietary
                          account and that the firm has a special interest in the price of the stock.
                               Additionally, disclosures must be made to clients regarding conflicts that may arise
                          in fee arrangements, subadvisory agreements, or other situations involving nonstandard
                          fee structures. Equally important is the disclosure of arrangements in which the firm
                          benefits directly from investment recommendations. An obvious conflict of interest
                          is the rebate of a portion of the service fee some classes of mutual funds charge to
                          investors. Members and candidates must disclose such relationships so clients can
                          fully understand such conflicts.

                          Cross-Departmental Conflicts
                          Other circumstances may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest. For
                          instance, a sell-side analyst working for a broker/dealer may be encouraged, not only
                          by members of her or his own firm but also by corporate issuers themselves, to write
                          research reports about particular companies. The buy-side analyst is likely to be faced
                          with similar conflicts as banks exercise their underwriting and security-dealing pow-
                          ers. The marketing division may ask an analyst to recommend the stock of a certain
                          company in order to obtain business from that company.
                              The potential for conflicts of interest also exists with broker-sponsored limited
                          partnerships formed to invest venture capital. Members and candidates may be
                          expected not only to follow issues from these partnerships once they are offered to the
                          public but also to promote the issues in the secondary market after public offerings.
                          Members and candidates must resolve situations presenting potential conflicts of
                          interest or disclose them in accordance with the principles set forth in Standard VI(A).

                          Conflicts with Stock Ownership
                          The most prevalent conflict requiring disclosure under Standard VI(A) is a member’s
                          or candidate’s ownership of stock in companies that he or she recommends to clients
                          or that clients hold. The simplest method for preventing a conflict is to avoid the
                          conflict by prohibiting members and candidates from owning any such securities, but
                          this approach may be overly burdensome and too restrictive. Members and candidates
                          must disclose any beneficial ownership interest in a security or other investment that
                          the member or candidate is recommending. Conflicts arising from personal investing
                          are discussed more fully in the guidance for Standard VI(B).

                          Conflicts as a Board Member or Director
                          Service as a board member or director poses three basic conflicts of interest. First, a
                          conflict may exist between the duties owed to clients and the duties owed to share-
                          holders of the company. Second, investment personnel who serve as directors may
                          receive securities or options to purchase securities of the company as compensation

for serving on the board, which could raise questions about trading actions that might
increase the value of those securities. Third, board service creates the opportunity
to receive material nonpublic information involving the company. Even though the
information is confidential, the perception could be that information not available
to the public is being communicated to a director’s firm—whether a broker, invest-
ment adviser, or other type of organization. When members or candidates providing
investment services also serve as directors, they should be isolated from those making
investment decisions by the use of firewalls or similar restrictions.




STANDARD VI(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                           55
Example 1 (Conflict of Interest and Business Relationships):
Henry Weiss is a research analyst with Williamsburg Company, a broker and invest-
ment banking firm. Williamsburg’s merger and acquisition department has represented
Jimco, a conglomerate, in all of Jimco’s acquisitions for 20 years. From time to time,
Williamsburg officers sit on the boards of directors of various Jimco subsidiaries.
Weiss is writing a research report on Jimco.
       Comment: Weiss must disclose in his research report Williamsburg’s special
       relationship with Jimco. Broker/dealer management of and participation in
       public offerings must be disclosed in research reports. Because the position
       of underwriter to a company entails a special past and potential future
       relationship with a company that is the subject of investment advice, it
       threatens the independence and objectivity of the report writer and must
       be disclosed.



Example 2 (Conflict of Interest and Business Stock Ownership):
The investment management firm of Dover & Roe sells a 25% interest in its partner-
ship to a multinational bank holding company, First of New York. Immediately after
the sale, Roy Hobbs, president of Dover & Roe, changes her recommendation for
First of New York’s common stock from “sell” to “buy” and adds First of New York’s
commercial paper to Dover & Roe’s approved list for purchase.
       Comment: Best practice would be for Hobbs to discontinue research cover-
       age of First of New York because the new ownership interest in this company
       creates a conflict of interest. At minimum, Hobbs must disclose the new
       relationship with First of New York to all Dover & Roe clients. Hobbs must
       also require the ownership interest to be disclosed to clients by the firm’s
       portfolio managers when they make specific investment recommendations
       or take investment actions with respect to First of New York’s securities.



Example 3 (Conflict of Interest and Personal Stock Ownership):
Karl Fargmon, a research analyst who follows firms producing office equipment, has
been recommending purchase of Kincaid Printing because of its innovative new line
of copiers. After his initial report on the company, Fargmon’s wife inherits from a
distant relative US$3 million of Kincaid stock. One year after his initial report on the
company, Fargmon is asked to write a follow-up report on Kincaid.

                                 Comment: At minimum, Fargmon must disclose his wife’s ownership of the
                                 Kincaid stock to his employer and in his follow-up report. Best practice
                                 is to avoid the conflict by asking his employer to assign another analyst to
                                 draft the follow-up report.



                          Example 4 (Conflict of Interest and Personal Stock Ownership):
                          Julie Roberts is speculating in penny stocks for her own account and purchases
                          100,000 shares of Drew Mining, Inc., for US$0.30 a share. She intends to sell these
                          shares at the sign of any substantial upward price movement of the stock. A week
                          later, her employer asks her to write a report on penny stocks in the mining industry
                          to be published in two weeks. Even without owning the Drew stock, Roberts would
                          recommend it in her report as a “buy.” A surge in the price of the stock to the US$2
                          range is likely to result once the report is issued.
                                 Comment: Roberts must disclose the conflict to her employer and should
                                 consider declining the research assignment on Drew Mining. If Roberts’s
                                 employer has her write the report despite the conflict, Roberts must disclose
                                 the conflict in her report.



                          Example 5 (Conflict of Interest and Compensation
                          Arrangements):
                          Sarah Snead, a portfolio manager for Thomas Investment Counsel, LLC, specializes
                          in managing public retirement funds and defined benefit pension plan accounts, all
                          of which have long-term investment objectives. A year ago, Snead’s employer, in an
                          attempt to motivate and retain key investment professionals, introduced a bonus
                          compensation system that rewards portfolio managers on the basis of quarterly per-
                          formance relative to their peers and to certain benchmark indexes. In an attempt to
                          improve the short-term performance of her accounts, Snead changes her investment
                          strategy and purchases several high-beta stocks for client portfolios. These purchases
                          are seemingly contrary to the clients’ investment policy statements (IPSs). No change
                          in objective or strategy has been recommended by Snead during the year.
                                 Comment: Snead has violated Standard VI(A) by failing to inform her clients
                                 of the changes in her compensation arrangement with her employer, which
                                 created a conflict of interest between her compensation and her clients’
                                 IPSs. Firms may pay employees on the basis of performance, but pressure
                                 by Thomas Investment Counsel to achieve short-term performance goals
                                 conflicts with the requirement to take only investment actions that are
                                 consistent with the objectives of Snead’s accounts.



                          Example 6 (Conflict of Interest and Compensation
                          Arrangements):
                          Kevin Carter is a representative with Bengal International, a registered broker/dealer.
                          Carter is approached by a stock promoter for Badger Company, who offers to pay
                          Carter additional compensation for sales of Badger Company’s stock to Carter’s clients.
                          Carter accepts the stock promoter’s offer but does not disclose the arrangement to his
                          clients or to his employer. Carter sells shares of the stock to his clients.

       Comment: Carter has violated Standard VI(A) by failing to disclose to clients
       that he is receiving additional compensation for recommending and selling
       Badger stock. At minimum, Carter must disclose the arrangement with
       Badger to his clients so they may evaluate whether Carter’s recommenda-
       tions to buy Badger were affected by this arrangement. Best practice is for
       Carter to avoid this conflict of interest altogether by declining the offer of
       additional compensation from Badger Company.



Example 7 (Conflict of Interest and Requested Favors):
Henri Papis is the chief investment officer of his state’s retirement fund. The fund
has always used external managers for the real estate allocation, and this information
is clearly presented in all fund communications. Eric Nagle, a recognized sell-side
research analyst and Papis’s business school classmate, recently left the investment
bank he worked for to start his own asset management firm, Accessible Real Estate.
Nagle is trying to build his assets under management, and he contacts Papis about
gaining some of the retirement fund’s real estate allocation. In the previous few years,
the performance of the retirement fund’s real estate investments was in line with the
fund’s benchmark but was not extraordinary. Papis decides to help out his old friend
and also to seek better returns by moving the real estate allocation to Accessible. The
only notice of the change in managers appears in the next annual report in the listing
of external managers.
       Comment: Papis has violated Standard VI(A) by not disclosing to his
       employer his personal relationship with Nagle. Disclosure of his past history
       with Nagle would allow his firm to determine whether the conflict may have
       impaired Papis’s independence in deciding to change external managers.

                          of a conflict of interest with respect to personal transactions. Client interests have
                          priority. Client transactions must take precedence over transactions made on behalf
                          of the member’s or candidate’s firm or personal transactions.

                          Avoiding Potential Conflicts
                          Conflicts between the client’s interest and an investment professional’s personal
                          interest may occur. Although conflicts of interest exist, nothing is inherently unethical
                          about individual managers, advisers, or mutual fund employees making money from
                          personal investments as long as (1) the client is not disadvantaged by the trade, (2) the
                          investment professional does not benefit personally from trades undertaken for clients,
                          and (3) the investment professional complies with applicable regulatory requirements.
                              Some situations occur where a member or candidate may need to enter a personal
                          transaction that runs counter to current recommendations or what the portfolio
                          manager is doing for client portfolios. For example, a member or candidate may be
                          required at some point to sell an asset to make a college tuition payment or a down
                          payment on a home, to meet a margin call, or so on. The sale may be contrary to the
                          long-term advice the member or candidate is currently providing to clients. In these
                          situations, the same three criteria given in the preceding paragraph should be applied
                          in the transaction so as to not violate Standard VI(B).

                          Personal Trading Secondary to Trading for Clients
                          Standard VI(B) states that transactions for clients and employers must have priority
                          over transactions in securities or other investments for which a member or candidate
                          is the beneficial owner. The objective of the standard is to prevent personal trans-
                          actions from adversely affecting the interests of clients or employers. A member or
                          candidate having the same investment positions or being co-invested with clients
                          does not always create a conflict. Some clients in certain investment situations require
                          members or candidates to have aligned interests. Personal investment positions or
                          transactions of members or candidates or their firm should never, however, adversely
                          affect client investments.

                          Standards for Nonpublic Information
                          Standard VI(B) covers the activities of members and candidates who have knowledge
                          of pending transactions that may be made on behalf of their clients or employers,
                          who have access to nonpublic information during the normal preparation of research
                          recommendations, or who take investment actions. Members and candidates are
                          prohibited from conveying nonpublic information to any person whose relationship
                          to the member or candidate makes the member or candidate a beneficial owner of
                          the person’s securities. Members and candidates must not convey this information to
                          any other person if the nonpublic information can be deemed material.

                          Impact on All Accounts with Beneficial Ownership
                          Members or candidates may undertake transactions in accounts for which they are a
                          beneficial owner only after their clients and employers have had adequate opportu-
                          nity to act on a recommendation. Personal transactions include those made for the
                          member’s or candidate’s own account, for family (including spouse, children, and
                          other immediate family members) accounts, and for accounts in which the member
                          or candidate has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, such as a trust or retirement

Standard VI(B): Recommended Procedures                                                            203


account. Family accounts that are client accounts should be treated like any other firm
account and should neither be given special treatment nor be disadvantaged because
of the family relationship. If a member or candidate has a beneficial ownership in
the account, however, the member or candidate may be subject to preclearance or
reporting requirements of the employer or applicable law.




STANDARD VI(B): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
Policies and procedures designed to prevent potential conflicts of interest, and even the
                                                                                             57
appearance of a conflict of interest, with respect to personal transactions are critical
to establishing investor confidence in the securities industry. Therefore, members and
candidates should urge their firms to establish such policies and procedures. Because
investment firms vary greatly in assets under management, types of clients, number
of employees, and so on, each firm should have policies regarding personal investing
that are best suited to the firm. Members and candidates should then prominently
disclose these policies to clients and prospective clients.
    The specific provisions of each firm’s standards will vary, but all firms should adopt
certain basic procedures to address the conflict areas created by personal investing.
These procedures include the following:
    ■   Limited participation in equity IPOs: Some eagerly awaited IPOs rise signifi-
        cantly in value shortly after the issue is brought to market. Because the new
        issue may be highly attractive and sought after, the opportunity to partici-
        pate in the IPO may be limited. Therefore, purchases of IPOs by investment
        personnel create conflicts of interest in two principal ways. First, partic-
        ipation in an IPO may have the appearance of taking away an attractive
        investment opportunity from clients for personal gain—a clear breach of the
        duty of loyalty to clients. Second, personal purchases in IPOs may have the
        appearance that the investment opportunity is being bestowed as an incen-
        tive to make future investment decisions for the benefit of the party provid-
        ing the opportunity. Members and candidates can avoid these conflicts or
        appearances of conflicts of interest by not participating in IPOs.
        Reliable and systematic review procedures should be established to ensure
        that conflicts relating to IPOs are identified and appropriately dealt with by
        supervisors. Members and candidates should preclear their participation in
        IPOs, even in situations without any conflict of interest between a member’s
        or candidate’s participation in an IPO and the client’s interests. Members
        and candidates should not benefit from the position that their clients occupy
        in the marketplace—through preferred trading, the allocation of limited
        offerings, or oversubscription.
    ■   Restrictions on private placements: Strict limits should be placed on invest-
        ment personnel acquiring securities in private placements, and appropri-
        ate supervisory and review procedures should be established to prevent
        noncompliance.
        Firms do not routinely use private placements for clients (e.g., venture cap-
        ital deals) because of the high risk associated with them. Conflicts related
        to private placements are more significant to members and candidates who
        manage large pools of assets or act as plan sponsors because these man-
        agers may be offered special opportunities, such as private placements, as
        a reward or an enticement for continuing to do business with a particular
        broker.

                                  Participation in private placements raises conflict-of-interest issues that are
                                  similar to issues surrounding IPOs. Investment personnel should not be
                                  involved in transactions, including (but not limited to) private placements,
                                  that could be perceived as favors or gifts that seem designed to influence
                                  future judgment or to reward past business deals.
                                  Whether the venture eventually proves to be good or bad, managers have
                                  an immediate conflict concerning private placement opportunities. If and
                                  when the investments go public, participants in private placements have an
                                  incentive to recommend the investments to clients regardless of the suitabil-
                                  ity of the investments for their clients. Doing so increases the value of the
                                  participants’ personal portfolios.
                              ■   Establish blackout/restricted periods: Investment personnel involved in the
                                  investment decision-making process should establish blackout periods prior
                                  to trades for clients so that managers cannot take advantage of their knowl-
                                  edge of client activity by “front-running” client trades (trading for one’s
                                  personal account before trading for client accounts).
                                  Individual firms must decide who within the firm should be required to
                                  comply with the trading restrictions. At a minimum, all individuals who are
                                  involved in the investment decision-making process should be subject to
                                  the same restricted period. Each firm must determine specific requirements
                                  related to blackout and restricted periods that are most relevant to the firm
                                  while ensuring that the procedures are governed by the guiding principles
                                  set forth in the Code and Standards. Size of firm and type of securities
                                  purchased are relevant factors. For example, in a large firm, a blackout
                                  requirement is, in effect, a total trading ban because the firm is continually
                                  trading in most securities. In a small firm, the blackout period is more likely
                                  to prevent the investment manager from front-running.
                              ■   Reporting requirements: Supervisors should establish reporting procedures
                                  for investment personnel, including disclosure of personal holdings/benefi-
                                  cial ownerships, confirmations of trades to the firm and the employee, and
                                  preclearance procedures. Once trading restrictions are in place, they must
                                  be enforced. The best method for monitoring and enforcing procedures
                                  to eliminate conflicts of interest in personal trading is through reporting
                                  requirements, including the following:

                                  ●   Disclosure of holdings in which the employee has a beneficial interest:
                                      Disclosure by investment personnel to the firm should be made upon
                                      commencement of the employment relationship and at least annually
                                      thereafter. To address privacy considerations, disclosure of personal
                                      holdings should be handled in a confidential manner by the firm.
                                  ●   Providing duplicate confirmations of transactions: Investment personnel
                                      should be required to direct their brokers to supply to firms duplicate
                                      copies or confirmations of all their personal securities transactions and
                                      copies of periodic statements for all securities accounts. The duplicate
                                      confirmation requirement has two purposes: (1) The requirement sends
                                      a message that there is independent verification, which reduces the
                                      likelihood of unethical behavior, and (2) it enables verification of the
                                      accounting of the flow of personal investments that cannot be deter-
                                      mined from merely looking at holdings.
                                  ●   Preclearance procedures: Investment personnel should examine all
                                      planned personal trades to identify possible conflicts prior to the exe-
                                      cution of the trades. Preclearance procedures are designed to identify
                                      possible conflicts before a problem arises.

Standard VI(B): Application of the Standard                                                        205


    ■   Disclosure of policies: Members and candidates should fully disclose to
        investors their firm’s policies regarding personal investing. The information
        about employees’ personal investment activities and policies will foster an
        atmosphere of full and complete disclosure and calm the public’s legiti-
        mate concerns about the conflicts of interest posed by investment person-
        nel’s personal trading. The disclosure must provide helpful information to
        investors; it should not be simply boilerplate language, such as “investment
        personnel are subject to policies and procedures regarding their personal
        trading.”




STANDARD VI(B): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                              58
Example 1 (Personal Trading):
Research analyst Marlon Long does not recommend purchase of a common stock for
his employer’s account because he wants to purchase the stock personally and does
not want to wait until the recommendation is approved and the stock is purchased
by his employer.
        Comment: Long has violated Standard VI(B) by taking advantage of his
        knowledge of the stock’s value before allowing his employer to benefit
        from that information.



Example 2 (Trading for Family Member Account):
Carol Baker, the portfolio manager of an aggressive growth mutual fund, maintains
an account in her husband’s name at several brokerage firms with which the fund
and a number of Baker’s other individual clients do a substantial amount of business.
Whenever a hot issue becomes available, she instructs the brokers to buy it for her
husband’s account. Because such issues normally are scarce, Baker often acquires
shares in hot issues but her clients are not able to participate in them.
        Comment: To avoid violating Standard VI(B), Baker must acquire shares
        for her mutual fund first and acquire them for her husband’s account only
        after doing so, even though she might miss out on participating in new
        issues via her husband’s account. She also must disclose the trading for her
        husband’s account to her employer because this activity creates a conflict
        between her personal interests and her employer’s interests.



Example 3 (Family Accounts as Equals):
Erin Toffler, a portfolio manager at Esposito Investments, manages the retirement
account established with the firm by her parents. Whenever IPOs become available,
she first allocates shares to all her other clients for whom the investment is appropriate;
only then does she place any remaining portion in her parents’ account, if the issue
is appropriate for them. She has adopted this procedure so that no one can accuse
her of favoring her parents.

                                 Comment: Toffler has violated Standard VI(B) by breaching her duty to her
                                 parents by treating them differently from her other accounts simply because
                                 of the family relationship. As fee-paying clients of Esposito Investments,
                                 Toffler’s parents are entitled to the same treatment as any other client of
                                 the firm. If Toffler has beneficial ownership in the account, however, and
                                 Esposito Investments has preclearance and reporting requirements for
                                 personal transactions, she may have to preclear the trades and report the
                                 transactions to Esposito.



                          Example 4 (Personal Trading and Disclosure):
                          Gary Michaels is an entry-level employee who holds a low-paying job serving both
                          the research department and the investment management department of an active
                          investment management firm. He purchases a sports car and begins to wear expensive
                          clothes after only a year of employment with the firm. The director of the investment
                          management department, who has responsibility for monitoring the personal stock
                          transactions of all employees, investigates and discovers that Michaels has made sub-
                          stantial investment gains by purchasing stocks just before they were put on the firm’s
                          recommended “buy” list. Michaels was regularly given the firm’s quarterly personal
                          transaction form but declined to complete it.
                                 Comment: Michaels violated Standard VI(B) by placing personal transactions
                                 ahead of client transactions. In addition, his supervisor violated Standard
                                 IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors by permitting Michaels to continue
                                 to perform his assigned tasks without having signed the quarterly personal
                                 transaction form. Note also that if Michaels had communicated information
                                 about the firm’s recommendations to a person who traded the security, that
                                 action would be a misappropriation of the information and a violation of
                                 Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information.



                          Example 5 (Trading Prior to Report Dissemination):
                          A brokerage’s insurance analyst, Denise Wilson, makes a closed-circuit TV report to
                          her firm’s branches around the country. During the broadcast, she includes negative
                          comments about a major company in the insurance industry. The following day, Wilson’s
                          report is printed and distributed to the sales force and public customers. The report
                          recommends that both short-term traders and intermediate investors take profits by
                          selling that insurance company’s stock. Seven minutes after the broadcast, however,
                          Ellen Riley, head of the firm’s trading department, had closed out a long “call” posi-
                          tion in the stock. Shortly thereafter, Riley established a sizable “put” position in the
                          stock. When asked about her activities, Riley claimed she took the actions to facilitate
                          anticipated sales by institutional clients.
                                 Comment: Riley did not give customers an opportunity to buy or sell in the
                                 options market before the firm itself did. By taking action before the report
                                 was disseminated, Riley’s firm may have depressed the price of the calls
                                 and increased the price of the puts. The firm could have avoided a conflict
                                 of interest if it had waited to trade for its own account until its clients had
                                 an opportunity to receive and assimilate Wilson’s recommendations. As it
                                 is, Riley’s actions violated Standard VI(B).

   Members and Candidates must disclose to their employer, clients, and prospec-
   tive clients, as appropriate, any compensation, consideration, or benefit received
   from or paid to others for the recommendation of products or services.



Guidance
Standard VI(C) states the responsibility of members and candidates to inform their
employer, clients, and prospective clients of any benefit received for referrals of cus-
tomers and clients. Such disclosures allow clients or employers to evaluate (1) any
partiality shown in any recommendation of services and (2) the full cost of the services.
Members and candidates must disclose when they pay a fee or provide compensation
to others who have referred prospective clients to the member or candidate.
    Appropriate disclosure means that members and candidates must advise the
client or prospective client, before entry into any formal agreement for services, of
any benefit given or received for the recommendation of any services provided by the
member or candidate. In addition, the member or candidate must disclose the nature
of the consideration or benefit—for example, flat fee or percentage basis, one-time or
continuing benefit, based on performance, benefit in the form of provision of research,
or other noncash benefit—together with the estimated dollar value. Consideration
includes all fees, whether paid in cash, in soft dollars, or in kind.




STANDARD VI(C): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
Members and candidates should encourage their employers to develop procedures
                                                                                             60
related to referral fees. The firm may completely restrict such fees. If the firm does not
adopt a strict prohibition of such fees, the procedures should indicate the appropriate
steps for requesting approval.
    Employers should have investment professionals provide to the clients notification
of approved referral fee programs and provide the employer regular (at least quarterly)
updates on the amount and nature of compensation received.

            61            STANDARD VI(C): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD


                          Example 1 (Disclosure of Referral Arrangements and Outside
                          Parties):
                          Brady Securities, Inc., a broker/dealer, has established a referral arrangement with Lewis
                          Brothers, Ltd., an investment counseling firm. In this arrangement, Brady Securities
                          refers all prospective tax-exempt accounts, including pension, profit-sharing, and
                          endowment accounts, to Lewis Brothers. In return, Lewis Brothers makes available
                          to Brady Securities on a regular basis the security recommendations and reports of
                          its research staff, which registered representatives of Brady Securities use in serving
                          customers. In addition, Lewis Brothers conducts monthly economic and market reviews
                          for Brady Securities personnel and directs all stock commission business generated
                          by referral accounts to Brady Securities.
                               Willard White, a partner in Lewis Brothers, calculates that the incremental costs
                          involved in functioning as the research department of Brady Securities are US$20,000
                          annually.
                               Referrals from Brady Securities last year resulted in fee income of US$200,000
                          for Lewis Brothers, and directing all stock trades through Brady Securities resulted
                          in additional costs to Lewis Brothers’ clients of US$10,000.
                               Diane Branch, the chief financial officer of Maxwell Inc., contacts White and says
                          that she is seeking an investment manager for Maxwell’s profit-sharing plan. She adds,
                          “My friend Harold Hill at Brady Securities recommended your firm without qualifi-
                          cation, and that’s good enough for me. Do we have a deal?” White accepts the new
                          account but does not disclose his firm’s referral arrangement with Brady Securities.
                                 Comment: White has violated Standard VI(C) by failing to inform the pro-
                                 spective customer of the referral fee payable in services and commissions
                                 for an indefinite period to Brady Securities. Such disclosure could have
                                 caused Branch to reassess Hill’s recommendation and make a more critical
                                 evaluation of Lewis Brothers’ services.



                          Example 2 (Disclosure of Interdepartmental Referral
                          Arrangements):
                          James Handley works for the trust department of Central Trust Bank. He receives
                          compensation for each referral he makes to Central Trust’s brokerage department and
                          personal financial management department that results in a sale. He refers several of
                          his clients to the personal financial management department but does not disclose
                          the arrangement within Central Trust to his clients.
                                 Comment: Handley has violated Standard VI(C) by not disclosing the
                                 referral arrangement at Central Trust Bank to his clients. Standard VI(C)
                                 does not distinguish between referral payments paid by a third party for
                                 referring clients to the third party and internal payments paid within the
                                 firm to attract new business to a subsidiary. Members and candidates must
                                 disclose all such referral fees. Therefore, Handley is required to disclose,
                                 at the time of referral, any referral fee agreement in place among Central
                                 Trust Bank’s departments. The disclosure should include the nature and
                                 the value of the benefit and should be made in writing.

Example 3 (Disclosure of Referral Arrangements and Informing
Firm):
Katherine Roberts is a portfolio manager at Katama Investments, an advisory firm
specializing in managing assets for high-net-worth individuals. Katama’s trading desk
uses a variety of brokerage houses to execute trades on behalf of its clients. Roberts
asks the trading desk to direct a large portion of its commissions to Naushon, Inc., a
small broker/dealer run by one of Roberts’ business school classmates. Katama’s traders
have found that Naushon is not very competitive on pricing, and although Naushon
generates some research for its trading clients, Katama’s other analysts have found
most of Naushon’s research to be not especially useful. Nevertheless, the traders do as
Roberts asks, and in return for receiving a large portion of Katama’s business, Naushon
recommends the investment services of Roberts and Katama to its wealthiest clients.
This arrangement is not disclosed to either Katama or the clients referred by Naushon.
       Comment: Roberts is violating Standard VI(C) by failing to inform her
       employer of the referral arrangement.



Example 4 (Disclosure of Referral Arrangements and Outside
Organizations):
Alex Burl is a portfolio manager at Helpful Investments, a local investment advisory
firm. Burl is on the advisory board of his child’s school, which is looking for ways to
raise money to purchase new playground equipment for the school. Burl discusses a
plan with his supervisor in which he will donate to the school a portion of his service
fee from new clients referred by the parents of students at the school. Upon getting
the approval from Helpful, Burl presents the idea to the school’s advisory board and
directors. The school agrees to announce the program at the next parent event and
asks Burl to provide the appropriate written materials to be distributed. A week fol-
lowing the distribution of the flyers, Burl receives the first school-related referral. In
establishing the client’s investment policy statement, Burl clearly discusses the school’s
referral and outlines the plans for distributing the donation back to the school.
       Comment: Burl has not violated Standard VI(C) because he secured the
       permission of his employer, Helpful Investments, and the school prior to
       beginning the program and because he discussed the arrangement with the
       client at the time the investment policy statement was designed.



Example 5 (Disclosure of Referral Arrangements and Outside
Parties):
The sponsor of a state employee pension is seeking to hire a firm to manage the pen-
sion plan’s emerging market allocation. To assist in the review process, the sponsor
has hired Thomas Arrow as a consultant to solicit proposals from various advisers.
Arrow is contracted by the sponsor to represent its best interest in selecting the most
appropriate new manager. The process runs smoothly, and Overseas Investments is
selected as the new manager.
    The following year, news breaks that Arrow is under investigation by the local
regulator for accepting kickbacks from investment managers after they are awarded
new pension allocations. Overseas Investments is included in the list of firms allegedly
making these payments. Although the sponsor is happy with the performance of
Overseas since it has been managing the pension plan’s emerging market funds, the
sponsor still decides to have an independent review of the proposals and the selection

                          process to ensure that Overseas was the appropriate firm for its needs. This review
                          confirms that, even though Arrow was being paid by both parties, the recommendation
                          of Overseas appeared to be objective and appropriate.
                                  Comment: Arrow has violated Standard VI(C) because he did not disclose
                                  the fee being paid by Overseas. Withholding this information raises the
                                  question of a potential lack of objectivity in the recommendation of Overseas
                                  by Arrow; this aspect is in addition to questions about the legality of having
                                  firms pay to be considered for an allocation.
                                      Regulators and governmental agencies may adopt requirements con-
                                  cerning allowable consultant activities. Local regulations sometimes include
                                  having a consultant register with the regulatory agency’s ethics board.
                                  Regulator policies may include a prohibition on acceptance of payments
                                  from investment managers receiving allocations and require regular report-
                                  ing of contributions made to political organizations and candidates. Arrow
                                  would have to adhere to these requirements as well as the Code and
                                  Standards.

Standard VII: Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate                   211


Standard VII(A) covers the conduct of CFA Institute members and candidates involved
with the CFA Program and prohibits any conduct that undermines the public’s con-
fidence that the CFA charter represents a level of achievement based on merit and
ethical conduct. There is an array of CFA Institute programs beyond the CFA Program
that provide additional educational and credentialing opportunities, including the
Certificate in Investment Performance Measurement (CIPM®) Program and the CFA
Institute Investment Foundations® Program. The standard’s function is to hold members
and candidates to a high ethical criterion while they are participating in or involved
with any CFA Institute program. Conduct covered includes but is not limited to
   ■   giving or receiving assistance (cheating) on any CFA Institute examinations;
   ■   violating the rules, regulations, and testing policies of CFA Institute
       programs;
   ■   providing confidential program or exam information to candidates or the
       public;
   ■   disregarding or attempting to circumvent security measures established for
       any CFA Institute examinations;
   ■   improperly using an association with CFA Institute to further personal or
       professional goals; and
   ■   misrepresenting information on the Professional Conduct Statement or in
       the CFA Institute Continuing Education Program.


Confidential Program Information
CFA Institute is vigilant about protecting the integrity of CFA Institute programs’
content and examination processes. CFA Institute program rules, regulations, and
policies prohibit candidates from disclosing confidential material gained during the
exam process.
    Examples of information that cannot be disclosed by candidates sitting for an
exam include but are not limited to
   ■   specific details of questions appearing on the exam and
   ■   broad topical areas and formulas tested or not tested on the exam.
    All aspects of the exam, including questions, broad topical areas, and formulas,
tested or not tested, are considered confidential until such time as CFA Institute elects
to release them publicly. This confidentiality requirement allows CFA Institute to
maintain the integrity and rigor of exams for future candidates. Standard VII(A) does
not prohibit candidates from discussing nonconfidential information or curriculum
material with others or in study groups in preparation for the exam.
    Candidates increasingly use online forums and new technology as part of their
exam preparations. CFA Institute actively polices blogs, forums, and related social
networking groups for information considered confidential. The organization works
with both individual candidates and the sponsors of online or offline services to
promptly remove any and all violations. As noted in the discussion of Standard I(A)
Knowledge of the Law, candidates, members, and the public are encouraged to report
suspected violations to CFA Institute.

Additional CFA Program Restrictions
The CFA Program rules, regulations, and policies define additional allowed and dis-
allowed actions concerning the exams. Violating any of the testing policies, such as
the calculator policy, personal belongings policy, or the Candidate Pledge, constitutes
a violation of Standard VII(A). Candidates will find all of these policies on the CFA

                              Members may participate as volunteers in various aspects of the CFA Program.
                          Standard VII(A) prohibits members from disclosing and/or soliciting confidential
                          material gained prior to or during the exam and grading processes with those outside

                              ■   deliberation related to the exam process, and
                              ■   information related to the scoring of questions.

                          Members participating in any CFA Institute program should do so with the same level
                          of integrity and confidentiality as is required of participation in the CFA Program.

                          Expressing an Opinion
                          Standard VII(A) does not cover expressing opinions regarding CFA Institute, the
                          CFA Program, or other CFA Institute programs. Members and candidates are free
                          to disagree and express their disagreement with CFA Institute on its policies, its
                          procedures, or any advocacy positions taken by the organization. When expressing

                          Candidate     As a candidate in the CFA Program, I am obligated to follow Standard VII(A)
                          Pledge        of the CFA Institute Standards of Professional Conduct, which states that
                                        members and candidates must not engage in any conduct that compromises
                                        the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation or the
                                        integrity, validity, or security of the CFA exam.

                                        ■   Prior to this exam, I have not given or received information regarding the
                                            content of this exam. During this exam, I will not give or receive any infor-
                                            mation regarding the content of this exam.
                                        ■   After this exam, I will not disclose ANY portion of this exam and I will not
                                            remove ANY exam materials from the testing room in original or copied
                                            form. I understand that all exam materials, including my answers, are the
                                            property of CFA Institute and will not be returned to me in any form.
                                        ■   I will follow ALL rules of the CFA Program as stated on the CFA Institute
                                            website and the back cover of the exam book. My violation of any rules
                                            of the CFA Program will result in CFA Institute voiding my exam results
                                            and may lead to suspension or termination of my candidacy in the CFA
                                            Program.

STANDARD VII(A): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                          63
Example 1 (Sharing Exam Questions):
Travis Nero serves as a proctor for the administration of the CFA examination in his
city. In the course of his service, he reviews a copy of the Level II CFA exam on the
evening prior to the exam’s administration and provides information concerning the
exam questions to two candidates who use it to prepare for the exam.
       Comment: Nero and the two candidates have violated Standard VII(A).
       By giving information about the exam questions to two candidates, Nero
       provided an unfair advantage to the two candidates and undermined the
       integrity and validity of the Level II CFA exam as an accurate measure of the
       knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to earn the right to use the CFA
       designation. By accepting the information, the candidates also compromised
       the integrity and validity of the Level II CFA exam and undermined the
       ethical framework that is a key part of the designation.



Example 2 (Bringing Written Material into Exam Room):
Loren Sullivan is enrolled to take the Level II CFA exam. He has been having difficulty
remembering a particular formula, so prior to entering the exam room, he writes the
formula on the palm of his hand. During the afternoon section of the exam, a proctor
notices Sullivan looking at the palm of his hand. She asks to see his hand and finds
the formula.
       Comment: Because Sullivan wrote down information from the Candidate
       Body of Knowledge (CBOK) and took that written information into the exam
       room, his conduct compromised the validity of his exam performance and
       violated Standard VII(A). Sullivan’s conduct was also in direct contradiction
       with the rules and regulations of the CFA Program, the Candidate Pledge,
       and the CFA Institute Code and Standards.



Example 3 (Writing after Exam Period End):
At the conclusion of the morning section of the Level I CFA exam, the proctors
announce, “Stop writing now.” John Davis has not completed the exam, so he continues
to randomly fill in ovals on his answer sheet. A proctor approaches Davis’s desk and
reminds him that he should stop writing immediately. Davis, however, continues to
complete the answer sheet. After the proctor asks him to stop writing two additional
times, Davis finally puts down his pencil.
       Comment: By continuing to complete his exam after time was called, Davis
       has violated Standard VII(A). By continuing to write, Davis took an unfair
       advantage over other candidates, and his conduct compromised the validity
       of his exam performance. Additionally, by not heeding the proctor’s repeated
       instructions, Davis violated the rules and regulations of the CFA Program.

                          Example 4 (Sharing Exam Content):
                          After completing the Level II CFA exam, Annabelle Rossi posts on her blog about her
                          experience. She posts the following: “Level II is complete! I think I did fairly well on
                          the exam. It was really difficult, but fair. I think I did especially well on the derivatives
                          questions. And there were tons of them! I think I counted 18! The ethics questions
                          were really hard. I’m glad I spent so much time on the Code and Standards. I was
                          surprised to see there were no questions at all about IPO allocations. I expected there
                          to be a couple. Well, off to celebrate getting through it. See you tonight?”
                                 Comment: Rossi did not violate Standard VII(A) when she wrote about how
                                 difficult she found the exam or how well she thinks she may have done. By
                                 revealing portions of the CBOK covered on the exam and areas not cov-
                                 ered, however, she did violate Standard VII(A) and the Candidate Pledge.
                                 Depending on the time frame in which the comments were posted, Rossi
                                 not only may have assisted future candidates but also may have provided
                                 an unfair advantage to candidates yet to sit for the same exam, thereby
                                 undermining the integrity and validity of the Level II exam.



                          Example 5 (Sharing Exam Content):
                          Level I candidate Etienne Gagne has been a frequent visitor to an internet forum
                          designed specifically for CFA Program candidates. The week after completing the
                          Level I CFA exam, Gagne and several others begin a discussion thread on the forum
                          about the most challenging questions and attempt to determine the correct answers.
                                 Comment: Gagne has violated Standard VII(A) by providing and soliciting
                                 confidential exam information, which compromises the integrity of the
                                 exam process and violates the Candidate Pledge. In trying to determine
                                 correct answers to specific questions, the group’s discussion included
                                 question-specific details considered to be confidential to the CFA Program.



                          Example 6 (Sharing Exam Content):
                          CFA4Sure is a company that produces test-preparation materials for CFA Program
                          candidates. Many candidates register for and use the company’s products. The day
                          after the CFA exam, CFA4Sure sends an e-mail to all its customers asking them to
                          share with the company the hardest questions from the exam so that CFA4Sure can
                          better prepare its customers for the next exam administration. Marisol Pena e-mails
                          a summary of the questions she found most difficult on the exam.
                                 Comment: Pena has violated Standard VII(A) by disclosing a portion of the
                                 exam questions. The information provided is considered confidential until
                                 publicly released by CFA Institute. CFA4Sure is likely to use such feedback
                                 to refine its review materials for future candidates. Pena’s sharing of the
                                 specific questions undermines the integrity of the exam while potentially
                                 making the exam easier for future candidates.
                                     If the CFA4Sure employees who participated in the solicitation of
                                 confidential CFA Program information are CFA Institute members or
                                 candidates, they also have violated Standard VII(A).

Example 7 (Discussion of Exam Grading Guidelines and
Results):
Prior to participating in grading CFA exams, Wesley Whitcomb is required to sign a
CFA Institute Grader Agreement. As part of the Grader Agreement, Whitcomb agrees
not to reveal or discuss the exam materials with anyone except CFA Institute staff or
other graders. Several weeks after the conclusion of the CFA exam grading, Whitcomb
tells several colleagues who are candidates in the CFA Program which question he
graded. He also discusses the guideline answer and adds that few candidates scored
well on the question.
       Comment: Whitcomb violated Standard VII(A) by breaking the Grader
       Agreement and disclosing information related to a specific question on the
       exam, which compromised the integrity of the exam process.



Example 8 (Compromising CFA Institute Integrity as a
Volunteer):
Jose Ramirez is an investor-relations consultant for several small companies that
are seeking greater exposure to investors. He is also the program chair for the CFA
Institute society in the city where he works. Ramirez schedules only companies that
are his clients to make presentations to the society and excludes other companies.
       Comment: Ramirez, by using his volunteer position at CFA Institute to
       benefit himself and his clients, compromises the reputation and integrity
       of CFA Institute and thus violates Standard VII(A).



Example 9 (Compromising CFA Institute Integrity as a
Volunteer):
Marguerite Warrenski is a member of the CFA Institute GIPS Executive Committee,
which oversees the creation, implementation, and revision of the GIPS standards. As
a member of the Executive Committee, she has advance knowledge of confidential
information regarding the GIPS standards, including any new or revised standards
the committee is considering. She tells her clients that her Executive Committee
membership will allow her to better assist her clients in keeping up with changes to
the Standards and facilitating their compliance with the changes.
       Comment: Warrenski is using her association with the GIPS Executive
       Committee to promote her firm’s services to clients and potential clients.
       In defining her volunteer position at CFA Institute as a strategic business
       advantage over competing firms and implying to clients that she would
       use confidential information to further their interests, Warrenski is com-
       promising the reputation and integrity of CFA Institute and thus violating
       Standard VII(A). She may factually state her involvement with the Executive
       Committee but cannot infer any special advantage to her clients from such
       participation.

                          or candidacy in the CFA Program.

Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program       217


CFA Institute Membership
The term “CFA Institute member” refers to “regular” and “affiliate” members of CFA
Institute who have met the membership requirements as defined in the CFA Institute
Bylaws. Once accepted as a CFA Institute member, the member must satisfy the fol-
lowing requirements to maintain his or her status:
   ■   remit annually to CFA Institute a completed Professional Conduct
       Statement, which renews the commitment to abide by the requirements
       of the Code and Standards and the CFA Institute Professional Conduct
       Program, and
   ■   pay applicable CFA Institute membership dues on an annual basis.
    If a CFA Institute member fails to meet any of these requirements, the individual is
no longer considered an active member. Until membership is reactivated, individuals
must not present themselves to others as active members. They may state, however,
that they were CFA Institute members in the past or refer to the years when their
membership was active.

Using the CFA Designation
Those who have earned the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst® designation
are encouraged to do so but only in a manner that does not misrepresent or exaggerate
the meaning or implications of the designation. The use of the designation may be
accompanied by an accurate explanation of the requirements that have been met to
earn the right to use the designation.
    “CFA charterholders” are those individuals who have earned the right to use the
CFA designation granted by CFA Institute. These people have satisfied certain require-
ments, including completion of the CFA Program and required years of acceptable
work experience. Once granted the right to use the designation, individuals must also
satisfy the CFA Institute membership requirements (see above) to maintain their right
to use the designation.
    If a CFA charterholder fails to meet any of the membership requirements, he or
she forfeits the right to use the CFA designation. Until membership is reactivated,
individuals must not present themselves to others as CFA charterholders. They may
state, however, that they were charterholders in the past.
    Given the growing popularity of social media, where individuals may anonymously
express their opinions, pseudonyms or online profile names created to hide a member’s
identity should not be tagged with the CFA designation.
    Use of the CFA designation by a CFA charterholder is governed by the terms and
conditions of the annual Professional Conduct Statement Agreement, entered into
between CFA Institute and its membership prior to commencement of use of the CFA
designation and reaffirmed annually.

Referring to Candidacy in the CFA Program
Candidates in the CFA Program may refer to their participation in the CFA Program,
but such references must clearly state that an individual is a candidate in the CFA
Program and must not imply that the candidate has achieved any type of partial des-
ignation. A person is a candidate in the CFA Program if
   ■   the person’s application for registration in the CFA Program has been
       accepted by CFA Institute, as evidenced by issuance of a notice of accep-
       tance, and the person is enrolled to sit for a specified examination or
   ■   the registered person has sat for a specified exam but exam results have not
       yet been received.

                              If an individual is registered for the CFA Program but declines to sit for an exam
                          or otherwise does not meet the definition of a candidate as described in the CFA
                          Institute Bylaws, then that individual is no longer considered an active candidate.
                          Once the person is enrolled to sit for a future examination, his or her CFA Program
                          candidacy resumes.
                              CFA Program candidates must never state or imply that they have a partial des-
                          ignation as a result of passing one or more levels or cite an expected completion date
                          of any level of the CFA Program. Final award of the charter is subject to meeting the
                          CFA Program requirements and approval by the CFA Institute Board of Governors.
                              If a candidate passes each level of the exam in consecutive years and wants to state
                          that he or she did so, that is not a violation of Standard VII(B) because it is a statement
                          of fact. If the candidate then goes on to claim or imply superior ability by obtaining the
                          designation in only three years, however, he or she is in violation of Standard VII(B).
                              Exhibit 3 provides examples of proper and improper references to the CFA

            65            STANDARD VII(B): RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES
                          Misuse of a member’s CFA designation or CFA candidacy or improper reference to it
                          is common by those in a member’s or candidate’s firm who do not possess knowledge
                          of the requirements of Standard VII(B). As an appropriate step to reduce this risk,

members and candidates should disseminate written information about Standard VII(B)
and the accompanying guidance to their firm’s legal, compliance, public relations, and
marketing departments (see www​.cfainstitute​.org).
    For materials that refer to employees’ affiliation with CFA Institute, members
and candidates should encourage their firms to create templates that are approved
by a central authority (such as the compliance department) as being consistent with
Standard VII(B). This practice promotes consistency and accuracy in the firm of
references to CFA Institute membership, the CFA designation, and CFA candidacy.




STANDARD VII(B): APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD
                                                                                           66
Example 1 (Passing Exams in Consecutive Years):
An advertisement for AZ Investment Advisors states that all the firm’s principals
are CFA charterholders and all passed the three exams on their first attempt. The
advertisement prominently links this fact to the notion that AZ’s mutual funds have
achieved superior performance.
       Comment: AZ may state that all principals passed the three exams on the
       first try as long as this statement is true, but it must not be linked to per-
       formance or imply superior ability. Implying that (1) CFA charterholders
       achieve better investment results and (2) those who pass the exams on the
       first try may be more successful than those who do not violates Standard
       VII(B).



Example 2 (Right to Use CFA Designation):
Five years after receiving his CFA charter, Louis Vasseur resigns his position as an
investment analyst and spends the next two years traveling abroad. Because he is not
actively engaged in the investment profession, he does not file a completed Professional
Conduct Statement with CFA Institute and does not pay his CFA Institute member-
ship dues. At the conclusion of his travels, Vasseur becomes a self-employed analyst
accepting assignments as an independent contractor. Without reinstating his CFA
Institute membership by filing his Professional Conduct Statement and paying his
dues, he prints business cards that display “CFA” after his name.
       Comment: Vasseur has violated Standard VII(B) because his right to use
       the CFA designation was suspended when he failed to file his Professional
       Conduct Statement and stopped paying dues. Therefore, he no longer is able
       to state or imply that he is an active CFA charterholder. When Vasseur files
       his Professional Conduct Statement, resumes paying CFA Institute dues to
       activate his membership, and completes the CFA Institute reinstatement
       procedures, he will be eligible to use the CFA designation.

                          Example 3 (“Retired” CFA Institute Membership Status):
                          After a 25-year career, James Simpson retires from his firm. Because he is not actively
                          engaged in the investment profession, he does not file a completed Professional
                          Conduct Statement with CFA Institute and does not pay his CFA Institute membership
                          dues. Simpson designs a plain business card (without a corporate logo) to hand out
                          to friends with his new contact details, and he continues to put “CFA” after his name.
                                 Comment: Simpson has violated Standard VII(B). Because he failed to file his
                                 Professional Conduct Statement and ceased paying dues, his membership
                                 has been suspended and he has given up the right to use the CFA desig-
                                 nation. CFA Institute has procedures, however, for reclassifying a member
                                 and charterholder as “retired” and reducing the annual dues. If he wants
                                 to obtain retired status, he needs to file the appropriate paperwork with
                                 CFA Institute. When Simpson receives his notification from CFA Institute
                                 that his membership has been reclassified as retired and he resumes paying
                                 reduced dues, his membership will be reactivated and his right to use the
                                 CFA designation will be reinstated.



                          Example 4 (Stating Facts about CFA Designation and Program):
                          Rhonda Reese has been a CFA charterholder since 2000. In a conversation with a friend
                          who is considering enrolling in the CFA Program, she states that she has learned a
                          great deal from the CFA Program and that many firms require their employees to be
                          CFA charterholders. She would recommend the CFA Program to anyone pursuing a
                          career in investment management.
                                 Comment: Reese’s comments comply with Standard VII(B). Her statements
                                 refer to facts: The CFA Program enhanced her knowledge, and many firms
                                 require the CFA designation for their investment professionals.



                          Example 5 (Order of Professional and Academic Designations):
                          Tatiana Prittima has earned both her CFA designation and a PhD in finance. She
                          would like to cite both her accomplishments on her business card but is unsure of
                          the proper method for doing so.
                                 Comment: The order of designations cited on such items as resumes and
                                 business cards is a matter of personal preference. Prittima is free to cite the
                                 CFA designation either before or after citing her PhD. Multiple designations
                                 must be separated by a comma.



                          Example 6 (Use of Fictitious Name):
                          Barry Glass is the lead quantitative analyst at CityCenter Hedge Fund. Glass is
                          responsible for the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the proprietary
                          models the fund uses to manage its investors’ assets. Glass reads several high-level
                          mathematical publications and blogs to stay informed on current developments.
                          One blog, run by “Expert CFA,” presents some intriguing research that may benefit
                          one of CityCenter’s current models. Glass is under pressure from firm executives to
                          improve the model’s predictive abilities, and he incorporates the factors discussed in
                          the online research. The updated output recommends several new investments to the
                          fund’s portfolio managers.

                          The following information relates to questions
                          1-39
                              Unless otherwise stated in the question, all individuals in the following questions
                              are CFA Institute members or candidates in the CFA Program and, therefore,
                              are subject to the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional
                              Conduct.

                          1. Smith, a research analyst with a brokerage firm, decides to change his recommen-
                             dation for the common stock of Green Company, Inc., from a “buy” to a “sell.”
                             He mails this change in investment advice to all the firm’s clients on Wednesday.
                             The day after the mailing, a client calls with a buy order for 500 shares of Green
                             Company. In this circumstance, Smith should:
                              A. accept the order.

                              B. advise the customer of the change in recommendation before accepting the
                                 order.

                              C. not accept the order because it is contrary to the firm’s recommendation.

                          2. Which statement about a manager’s use of client brokerage commissions violates
                             the Code and Standards?
                              A. A client may direct a manager to use that client’s brokerage commissions to
                                 purchase goods and services for that client.

                              B. Client brokerage commissions should be used to benefit the client and
                                 should be commensurate with the value of the brokerage and research ser-
                                 vices received.

                              C. Client brokerage commissions may be directed to pay for the investment
                                 manager’s operating expenses.

                             ment has represented the Britland Company in all of its acquisitions for the past
                             20 years. Two of Howard & Howard’s senior officers are directors of various Brit-
                             land subsidiaries. Jamison has been asked to write a research report on Britland.
                             What is the best course of action for her to follow?
                              A. Jamison may write the report but must refrain from expressing any opinions
                                 because of the special relationships between the two companies.

                              B. Jamison should not write the report because the two Howard & Howard
                                 officers serve as directors for subsidiaries of Britland.

                              C. Jamison may write the report if she discloses the director relationship
                                 between the two companies.

   financial information, including planned expenditures. Bronson receives a phone
   call on Friday afternoon from Murdock, a prominent alumnus, requesting that
   Bronson fax him comprehensive financial information about the fund. According
   to Murdock, he has a potential contributor but needs the information that day to
   close the deal and cannot contact any of the trustees. Based on the CFA Institute
   Standards, Bronson should:
   A. send Murdock the information because disclosure would benefit the client.

   B. not send Murdock the information, to preserve confidentiality.

   C. send Murdock the information, provided Bronson promptly notifies the

6. Willier is the research analyst responsible for following Company X. All the
   information he has accumulated and documented suggests that the outlook for
   the company’s new products is poor, so the stock should be rated a weak “hold.”
   During lunch, however, Willier overhears a financial analyst from another firm
   whom he respects offer opinions that conflict with Willier’s forecasts and expec-
   tations. Upon returning to his office, Willier releases a strong “buy” recommen-
   dation to the public. Willier:
   A. violated the Standards by failing to distinguish between facts and opinions
      in his recommendation.

   B. violated the Standards because he did not have a reasonable and adequate
      basis for his recommendation.

   C. was in full compliance with the Standards.

7. An investment management firm has been hired by ETV Corporation to work on
   an additional public offering for the company. The firm’s brokerage unit now has
   a “sell” recommendation on ETV, but the head of the investment banking depart-
   ment has asked the head of the brokerage unit to change the recommendation
   from “sell” to “buy.” According to the Standards, the head of the brokerage unit
   would be permitted to:
   A. increase the recommendation by no more than one increment (in this case,
      to a “hold” recommendation).

   B. place the company on a restricted list and give only factual information
      about the company.

   C. assign a new analyst to decide whether the stock deserves a higher rating.

                              on his business card, but promotional material that he designed for the business
                              describes the CFA requirements and indicates that Tye participates in the CFA
                              Program and has completed Levels I and II. According to the Standards:
                              A. Albert has violated the Standards, but Tye has not.

                              B. Tye has violated the Standards, but Albert has not.

                              C. both Albert and Tye have violated the Standards.

                             Walkton a substantial tax break. The US representative for Walkton’s home dis-
                             trict has told Scott that, although she is lobbying hard for the bill and prospects
                             for its passage are favorable, concern of the US Congress over the federal deficit
                             could cause the tax bill to be voted down. Walkton Industries has not made any
                             statements about a change in dividend policy. Scott writes in his research report,
                             “We expect Walkton’s stock price to rise by at least US$8.00 a share by the end of
                             the year because the dividend will increase by US$1.50 a share. Investors buying
                             the stock at the current time should expect to realize a total return of at least 15%
                             on the stock.” According to the Standards:
                              A. Scott violated the Standards because he used material inside information.

                              B. Scott violated the Standards because he failed to separate opinion from fact.

                              C. Scott violated the Standards by basing his research on uncertain predictions
                                 of future government action.

                          10. Which one of the following actions will help ensure the fair treatment of broker-

                              A. Informing all people in the firm in advance that a recommendation is to be
                                 disseminated

                              B. Distributing recommendations to institutional clients prior to individual
                                 accounts

                              C. Minimizing the time between the decision and the dissemination of a
                                 recommendation

                          11. The mosaic theory holds that an analyst:

                              B. can use material public information and nonmaterial nonpublic information
                                 in the analyst’s analysis.

   A. turn down the additional compensation because it will result in conflicts

13. One of the discretionary accounts managed by Farnsworth is the Jones Corpora-
    tion employee profit-sharing plan. Jones, the company president, recently asked
    Farnsworth to vote the shares in the profit-sharing plan in favor of the slate of
    directors nominated by Jones Corporation and against the directors sponsored
    by a dissident stockholder group. Farnsworth does not want to lose this ac-
    count, because he directs all the account’s trades to a brokerage firm that pro-
    vides Farnsworth with useful information about tax-free investments. Although
    this information is not of value in managing the Jones Corporation account, it
    does help in managing several other accounts. The brokerage firm providing
    this information also offers the lowest commissions for trades and provides
    best execution. Farnsworth investigates the director issue, concludes that the
    management-nominated slate is better for the long-run performance of the com-
    pany than the dissident group’s slate, and votes accordingly. Farnsworth:
   A. violated the Standards in voting the shares in the manner requested by Jones
      but not in directing trades to the brokerage firm.

   B. did not violate the Standards in voting the shares in the manner requested
      by Jones or in directing trades to the brokerage firm.

   C. violated the Standards in directing trades to the brokerage firm but not in
      voting the shares as requested by Jones.

14. Brown works for an investment counseling firm. Green, a new client of the firm,
    is meeting with Brown for the first time. Green used another counseling firm for
    financial advice for years, but she has switched her account to Brown’s firm. After
    spending a few minutes getting acquainted, Brown explains to Green that she
    has discovered a highly undervalued stock that offers large potential gains. She
    recommends that Green purchase the stock. Brown has committed a violation of
    the Standards. What should she have done differently?
   A. Brown should have determined Green’s needs, objectives, and tolerance for
      risk before making a recommendation of any type of security.

   B. Brown should have thoroughly explained the characteristics of the company
      to Green, including the characteristics of the industry in which the company
      operates.

   C. Brown should have explained her qualifications, including her education,
      training, and experience and the meaning of the CFA designation.

                              A. Neither statement violated the Code and Standards.

                              B. Only statement I violated the Code and Standards.

                          16. Anderb, a portfolio manager for XYZ Investment Management Company—a
                              registered investment organization that advises investment firms and private
                              accounts—was promoted to that position three years ago. Bates, her supervisor,
                              is responsible for reviewing Anderb’s portfolio account transactions and her
                              required monthly reports of personal stock transactions. Anderb has been using
                              Jonelli, a broker, almost exclusively for brokerage transactions for the portfolio
                              account. For securities in which Jonelli’s firm makes a market, Jonelli has been
                              giving Anderb lower prices for personal purchases and higher prices for personal
                              sales than Jonelli gives to Anderb’s portfolio accounts and other investors. An-
                              derb has been filing monthly reports with Bates only for those months in which
                              she has no personal transactions, which is about every fourth month. Which of
                              the following is most likely to be a violation of the Code and Standards?
                              A. Anderb failed to disclose to her employer her personal transactions.

                              B. Anderb owned the same securities as those of her clients.

                              C. Bates allowed Anderb to use Jonelli as her broker for personal trades.

                          17. Which of the following is a correct statement of a member’s or candidate’s duty
                              under the Code and Standards?
                              A. In the absence of specific applicable law or other regulatory requirements,
                                 the Code and Standards govern the member’s or candidate’s actions.

                              B. A member or candidate is required to comply only with applicable local
                                 laws, rules, regulations, or customs, even though the Code and Standards
                                 may impose a higher degree of responsibility or a higher duty on the mem-
                                 ber or candidate.

                              C. A member or candidate who trades securities in a securities market where
                                 no applicable local laws or stock exchange rules regulate the use of material
                                 nonpublic information may take investment action based on material non-

                              trip, including the costs of meals, his hotel room, and air transportation. Which
                              of the following actions would be the best course for Ward to take under the
                              Code and Standards?
                              A. Accept the expense-paid trip, and write an objective report.

                              B. Pay for all travel expenses, including the costs of meals and incidental items.

                              C. Accept the expense-paid trip, but disclose the value of the services accepted

21. Michelieu tells a prospective client, “I may not have a long-term track record yet,
    but I’m sure that you’ll be very pleased with my recommendations and service.
    In the three years that I’ve been in the business, my equity-oriented clients
    have averaged a total return of more than 26% a year.” The statement is true, but
    Michelieu only has a few clients, and one of his clients took a large position in a
    penny stock (against Michelieu’s advice) and realized a huge gain. This large re-
    turn caused the average of all of Michelieu’s clients to exceed 26% a year. Without
    this one investment, the average gain would have been 8% a year. Has Michelieu
    violated the Standards?
   A. No, because Michelieu is not promising that he can earn a 26% return in the
      future.

   B. No, because the statement is a true and accurate description of Michelieu’s
      track record.

      exchange of information between the investment banking and brokerage
      operations.

   C. Monitor the exchange of information between the investment banking
      department and the brokerage operation.

                                 recommendation of services.

                              C. Disclosure means advising a prospective client about the referral arrange-

                              following describes Rose’s options under the Code and Standards?
                              A. Based on his firm’s “buy” recommendation, Rose cannot sell the
                                 shares because he would be improperly prospering from the inflated
                                 recommendation.

                              B. Rose is free to sell his personal holdings once his firm is properly informed
                                 of his intentions.

                              C. Rose can sell his personal holdings but only when a client of the firm places
                                 an order to buy shares of Household.

                          26. A former hedge fund manager, Jackman, has decided to launch a new private

                              needs to achieve US$1 million in assets under management in the first year.
                              Jackman offers a US$10,000 incentive to any adviser who joins his firm with the
                              minimum of US$200,000 in committed investments. Jackman places notice of
                              the opening on several industry web portals and career search sites. Which of the
                              following is correct according to the Code and Standards?
                              A. A member or candidate is eligible for the new position and incentive if he or
                                 she can arrange for enough current clients to switch to the new firm and if
                                 the member or candidate discloses the incentive fee.

                              B. A member or candidate may not accept employment with the new firm,
                                 because Jackman’s incentive offer violates the Code and Standards.

                              C. A member or candidate is not eligible for the new position unless he or she
                                 is currently unemployed, because soliciting the clients of the member’s or

   broker will apply the commissions paid on the new service toward satisfying the

   been satisfied with the execution provided on the full-service trades, and the fees
   of the new low-fee trades are comparable to those of other brokers currently used

   B. Carter cannot use the new trading scheme because the commissions are
      prohibited by the soft dollar restrictions of the accounts.

   C. Carter should trade only through the new low-fee scheme and should
      increase his trading volume to meet his required commission commitment.

    clearly describes in the fund’s prospectus its soft dollar policies. Stafford decides
    that entering the CFA Program will enhance her investment decision-making
    skill and decides to use the fund’s soft dollar account to pay the registration and
    exam fees for the CFA Program. Which of the following statements is most likely
    correct?
   A. Stafford did not violate the Code and Standards because the prospectus
      informed investors of the fund’s soft dollar policies.

   B. Stafford violated the Code and Standards because improving her investment
      skills is not a reasonable use of the soft dollar account.

   C. Stafford violated the Code and Standards because the CFA Program does
      not meet the definition of research allowed to be purchased with brokerage
      commissions.

                              A. Long may accept only the offer to have his conference-related expenses paid
                                 by the host firm.

                              B. Long may accept the offer to have his conference-related expenses paid and
                                 may attend the exclusive golf outing at the expense of the hosting firm.

                          31. Andrews, a private wealth manager, is conducting interviews for a new research
                              analyst for his firm. One of the candidates is Wright, an analyst with a local
                              investment bank. During the interview, while Wright is describing his analytical
                              skills, he mentions a current merger in which his firm is acting as the adviser.
                              Andrews has heard rumors of a possible merger between the two companies, but
                              no releases have been made by the companies concerned. Which of the following
                              actions by Andrews is least likely a violation of the Code and Standards?
                              A. Waiting until the next day before trading on the information to allow time
                                 for it to become public

                              B. Notifying all investment managers in his firm of the new information so
                                 none of their clients are disadvantaged

                              C. Placing the securities mentioned as part of the merger on the firm’s

                          32. Pietro, president of Local Bank, has hired the bank’s market maker, Vogt, to
                              seek a merger partner. Local is currently listed on a stock exchange and has not
                              reported that it is seeking strategic alternatives. Vogt has discussed the possibility
                              of a merger with several firms, but they have all decided to wait until after the
                              next period’s financial data are available. The potential buyers believe the results
                              will be worse than the results of prior periods and will allow them to pay less for
                              Local Bank. Pietro wants to increase the likelihood of structuring a merger deal
                              quickly. Which of the following actions would most likely be a violation of the
                              Code and Standards?
                              A. Pietro could instruct Local Bank to issue a press release announcing that it
                                 has retained Vogt to find a merger partner.

                              B. Pietro could place a buy order for 2,000 shares (or four times the average
                                 weekly volume) through Vogt for his personal account.

                              C. After confirming with Local’s chief financial officer, Pietro could instruct
                                 Local to issue a press release reaffirming the firm’s prior announced earn-

                          33. ABC Investment Management acquires a new, very large account with two
                              concentrated positions. The firm’s current policy is to add new accounts for the
                              purpose of performance calculation after the first full month of management.
                              Cupp is responsible for calculating the firm’s performance returns. Before the end
                              of the initial month, Cupp notices that one of the significant holdings of the new
                              accounts is acquired by another company, causing the value of the investment to
                              double. Because of this holding, Cupp decides to account for the new portfolio as
                              of the date of transfer, thereby allowing ABC Investment to reap the positive im-

   A. Cupp did not violate the Code and Standards, because the GIPS standards

34. Cannan has been working from home on weekends and occasionally saves corre-
    spondence with clients and completed reports on her home computer. Because of
    worsening market conditions, Cannan is one of several employees released by her
    firm. While Cannan is looking for a new job, she uses the files she saved at home
    to request letters of recommendation from former clients. She also provides to
    prospective clients some of the reports as examples of her abilities. Which of the
    following statements is true?
   A. Cannan violated the Code and Standards because she did not receive per-
      mission from her former employer to keep or use the files after her employ-
      ment ended.

   B. Cannan did not violate the Code and Standards, because the files were cre-
      ated and saved on her own time and computer.

   C. Cannan violated the Code and Standards because she is prohibited from
      saving files on her home computer.

    sume with the following statement: “In finishing the CFA Program, I improved
    my skills related to researching investments and managing portfolios. I will be
    eligible for the CFA charter upon completion of the required work experience.”
    Which of the following statements is true?
   A. Quinn violated the Code and Standards by claiming he improved his skills
      through the CFA Program.

   B. Quinn violated the Code and Standards by incorrectly stating that he is

   C. Quinn did not violate the Code and Standards with his resume update.

36. During a round of golf, Rodriguez, chief financial officer of Mega Retail, mentions
    to Hart, a local investment adviser and long-time personal friend, that Mega is
    having an exceptional sales quarter. Rodriguez expects the results to be almost
    10% above the current estimates. The next day, Hart initiates the purchase of a
    large stake in the local exchange-traded retail fund for her personal account.
   A. Hart violated the Code and Standards by investing in the exchange-traded
      fund that included Mega Retail.

   B. Hart did not violate the Code and Standards, because she did not invest
      directly in securities of Mega Retail.

   C. Rodriguez did not violate the Code and Standards, because the comments
      made to Hart were not intended to solicit an investment in Mega Retail.

                          37. Park is very frustrated after taking the Level II CFA exam. While she was study-
                              ing for the exam, to supplement the curriculum provided, she ordered and used
                              study material from a third-party provider. Park believes the additional material
                              focused her attention on specific topic areas that were not tested while ignoring
                              other areas. She posts the following statement on the provider’s discussion board:
                              “I am very dissatisfied with your firm’s CFA Program Level II material. I found
                              the exam extremely difficult and myself unprepared for specific questions after
                              using your product. How could your service provide such limited instructional
                              resources on the analysis of inventories and taxes when the exam had multiple
                              questions about them? I will not recommend your products to other candidates.”
                              Which of the following statements is true?
                              A. Park violated the Code and Standards by purchasing third-party review
                                 material.

                              B. Park violated the Code and Standards by providing her opinion on the diffi-
                                 culty of the exam.

                              C. Park violated the Code and Standards by providing specific information on
                                 topics tested on the exam.

                          38. Paper was recently terminated as one of a team of five managers of an equity
                              fund. The fund had two value-focused managers and terminated one of them to
                              reduce costs. In a letter sent to prospective employers, Paper presents, with writ-
                              ten permission of the firm, the performance history of the fund to demonstrate
                              his past success. Which of the following statements is true?
                              A. Paper did not violate the Code and Standards.

                              B. Paper violated the Code and Standards by claiming the performance of the
                                 entire fund as his own.

                              C. Paper violated the Code and Standards by including the historical results of

                          39. Townsend was recently appointed to the board of directors of a youth golf

                              program is beginning a new fund-raising campaign to expand the number of an-
                              nual scholarships it provides. Townsend believes many of her clients make annual
                              donations to charity. The next week in her regular newsletter to all clients, she
                              includes a small section discussing the fund-raising campaign and her position
                              on the organization’s board. Which of the following statements is true?
                              A. Townsend did not violate the Code and Standards.

                              B. Townsend violated the Code and Standards by soliciting donations from her
                                 clients through the newsletter.

   SOLUTIONS
1. The correct answer is B. This question involves Standard III(B) Fair Dealing.
   Smith disseminated a change in the stock recommendation to his clients but then
   received a request contrary to that recommendation from a client who probably
   had not yet received the recommendation. Prior to executing the order, Smith
   should take additional steps to ensure that the customer has received the change
   of recommendation. Answer A is incorrect because the client placed the order
   prior to receiving the recommendation and, therefore, does not have the benefit
   of Smith’s most recent recommendation. Answer C is also incorrect; simply be-
   cause the client request is contrary to the firm’s recommendation does not mean
   a member can override a direct request by a client. After Smith contacts the
   client to ensure that the client has received the changed recommendation, if the
   client still wants to place a buy order for the shares, Smith is obligated to comply
   with the client’s directive.

2. The correct answer is C. This question involves Standard III(A) Loyalty, Pru-
   dence, and Care and the specific topic of soft dollars or soft commissions.
   Answer C is the correct choice because client brokerage commissions may not
   be directed to pay for the investment manager’s operating expenses. Answer B
   describes how members and candidates should determine how to use brokerage
   commissions—that is, if the use is in the best interests of clients and is commen-
   surate with the value of the services provided. Answer A describes a practice that
   is commonly referred to as “directed brokerage.” Because brokerage is an asset of
   the client and is used to benefit the client, not the manager, such practice does
   not violate a duty of loyalty to the client. Members and candidates are obligated
   in all situations to disclose to clients their practices in the use of client brokerage
   commissions.

3. The correct answer is B. This question involves Standard VI(A) Avoid or Disclose
   Conflicts. The question establishes a conflict of interest in which an analyst,
   Jamison, is asked to write a research report on a company that is a client of her
   employer. In addition, two directors of the company are senior officers of Jami-
   son’s employer. Best practice would be to avoid the conflicts of interest by not
   providing a research report on companies that are clients of or have a director
   relationship with Howard & Howard. If the conflicts are not avoided, both the
   client relationship and director relationship must be disclosed by Jamison in her
   research report. Answer C is incorrect because Jamison would be disclosing only
   one of the conflicts. Answer A is incorrect because whether Jamison expresses
   any opinions in the report is irrelevant to her duty to disclose all conflicts of
   interest. Not expressing opinions does not relieve the analyst of the responsibility
   to disclose the special relationships between the two companies.

4. The correct answer is C. This question asks about compliance procedures relating
   to personal investments of members and candidates. The statement in answer C
   clearly conflicts with the recommended procedures in the Standards of Practice
   Handbook. Employers should compare personal transactions of employees with
   those of clients on a regular basis regardless of the existence of a requirement by
   any regulatory organization. Such comparisons ensure that employees’ personal
   trades do not conflict with their duty to their clients, and the comparisons can be
   conducted in a confidential manner. The statement in answer A does not con-
   flict with the procedures in the Handbook. Disclosure of such policies will give
   full information to clients regarding potential conflicts of interest on the part of
   those entrusted to manage their money. Answer B is incorrect because firms are

                              encouraged to establish policies whereby employees clear their personal holdings
                              and transactions with their employers.

                          5. The correct answer is B. This question relates to Standard III(A) Loyalty, Pru-
                             dence, and Care and Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality. In this case,
                             the member manages funds of a private endowment. Clients—in this case, the
                             trustees of the fund—must place some trust in members and candidates. Bron-
                             son cannot disclose confidential financial information to anyone without the
                             permission of the fund, regardless of whether the disclosure may benefit the
                             fund. Therefore, answer A is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because Bronson
                             must notify the fund and obtain the fund’s permission before publicizing the
                             information.

                          6. The correct answer is B. This question relates to Standard V(A) Diligence and
                             Reasonable Basis. The opinion of another financial analyst is not an adequate
                             basis for Willier’s action in changing the recommendation. Answer C is thus
                             incorrect. Answer A is incorrect because, although it is true that members and
                             candidates must distinguish between facts and opinions in recommendations, the
                             question does not illustrate a violation of that nature. If the opinion overheard
                             by Willier had sparked him to conduct additional research and investigation
                             that justified a change of opinion, then a changed recommendation would be
                             appropriate.

                          7. The correct answer is B. This question relates to Standard I(B) Independence and
                             Objectivity. When asked to change a recommendation on a company stock to
                             gain business for the firm, the head of the brokerage unit must refuse in order to
                             maintain his independence and objectivity in making recommendations. He must
                             not yield to pressure by the firm’s investment banking department. To avoid the
                             appearance of a conflict of interest, the firm should discontinue issuing recom-
                             mendations about the company. Answer A is incorrect; changing the recommen-
                             dation in any manner that is contrary to the analyst’s opinion violates the duty
                             to maintain independence and objectivity. Answer C is incorrect because merely
                             assigning a new analyst to decide whether the stock deserves a higher rating will
                             not address the conflict of interest.

                          8. The correct answer is A. Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA
                             Designation, and the CFA Program is the subject of this question. The reference
                             on Albert’s business card implies that there is a “CFA Level II” designation; Tye
                             merely indicates in promotional material that he is participating in the CFA
                             Program and has completed Levels I and II. Candidates may not imply that there
                             is some sort of partial designation earned after passing a level of the CFA exam.
                             Therefore, Albert has violated Standard VII(B). Candidates may communicate
                             that they are participating in the CFA Program, however, and may state the levels
                             that they have completed. Therefore, Tye has not violated Standard VII(B).

                          9. The correct answer is B. This question relates to Standard V(B) Communication
                             with Clients and Prospective Clients. Scott has issued a research report stating
                             that he expects the price of Walkton Industries stock to rise by US$8 a share
                             “because the dividend will increase” by US$1.50 per share. He has made this
                             statement knowing that the dividend will increase only if Congress enacts certain
                             legislation, an uncertain prospect. By stating that the dividend will increase, Scott
                             failed to separate fact from opinion. The information regarding passage of legisla-
                             tion is not material nonpublic information because it is conjecture, and the ques-
                             tion does not state whether the US representative gave Scott her opinion on the
                             passage of the legislation in confidence. She could have been offering this opinion
                             to anyone who asked. Therefore, answer A is incorrect. It may be acceptable to
                             base a recommendation, in part, on an expectation of future events, even though

   they may be uncertain. Therefore, answer C is incorrect.

10. The correct answer is C. This question, which relates to Standard III(B) Fair
    Dealing, tests the knowledge of the procedures that will assist members and
    candidates in treating clients fairly when making investment recommendations.
    The step listed in C will help ensure the fair treatment of clients. Answer A may
    have negative effects on the fair treatment of clients. The more people who know
    about a pending change, the greater the chance that someone will inform some
    clients before the information’s release. The firm should establish policies that
    limit the number of people who are aware in advance that a recommendation is
    to be disseminated. Answer B, distributing recommendations to institutional cli-
    ents before distributing them to individual accounts, discriminates among clients
    on the basis of size and class of assets and is a violation of Standard III(B).

11. The correct answer is B. This question deals with Standard II(A) Material Non-
    public Information. The mosaic theory states that an analyst may use material
    public information and nonmaterial nonpublic information in creating a larger
    picture than shown by any individual piece of information and the conclusions
    the analyst reaches become material only after the pieces are assembled. Answers
    A and C are accurate statements relating to the Code and Standards but do not
    describe the mosaic theory.

12. The correct answer is C. This question involves Standard IV(B) Additional Com-
    pensation Arrangements. The arrangement described in the question—whereby
    Jurgen would be compensated beyond the compensation provided by her firm,
    on the basis of an account’s performance—is not a violation of the Standards as
    long as Jurgen discloses the arrangement in writing to her employer and obtains
    permission from her employer prior to entering into the arrangement. Answers
    A and B are incorrect; although the private compensation arrangement could
    conflict with the interests of other clients and lead to short-term performance
    pressures, members and candidates may enter into such agreements as long as
    they have disclosed the arrangements to their employer and obtained permission
    for the arrangement from their employer.

13. The correct answer is B. This question relates to Standard III(A) Loyalty, Pru-
    dence, and Care—specifically, a member’s or candidate’s responsibility for
    voting proxies and the use of client brokerage. According to the facts stated in
    the question, Farnsworth did not violate Standard III(A). Although the com-
    pany president asked Farnsworth to vote the shares of the Jones Corporation
    profit-sharing plan a certain way, Farnsworth investigated the issue and conclud-
    ed, independently, the best way to vote. Therefore, even though his decision co-
    incided with the wishes of the company president, Farnsworth is not in violation
    of his responsibility to be loyal and to provide care to his clients. In this case, the
    participants and the beneficiaries of the profit-sharing plan are the clients, not
    the company’s management. Had Farnsworth not investigated the issue or had
    he yielded to the president’s wishes and voted for a slate of directors that he had
    determined was not in the best interest of the company, Farnsworth would have
    violated his responsibilities to the beneficiaries of the plan. In addition, because
    the brokerage firm provides the lowest commissions and best execution for secu-
    rities transactions, Farnsworth has met his obligations to the client in using this
    brokerage firm. It does not matter that the brokerage firm also provides research
    information that is not useful for the account generating the commission, be-
    cause Farnsworth is not paying extra money of the client for that information.

14. The correct answer is A. In this question, Brown is providing investment recom-
    mendations before making inquiries about the client’s financial situation, in-

                              III(C) Suitability. Answers B and C provide examples of information members
                              and candidates should discuss with their clients at the outset of the relationship,
                              but these answers do not constitute a complete list of those factors. Answer A is
                              the best answer.

                          15. The correct answer is C. This question involves Standard I(C) Misrepresentation.
                              Statement I is a factual statement that discloses to clients and prospects accurate
                              information about the terms of the investment instrument. Statement II, which
                              guarantees a specific rate of return for a mutual fund, is an opinion stated as
                              a fact and, therefore, violates Standard I(C). If statement II were rephrased to
                              include a qualifying statement, such as “in my opinion, investors may earn . . . , ”
                              it would not be in violation of the Standards.

                          16. The correct answer is A. This question involves three of the Standards. Anderb,
                              the portfolio manager, has been obtaining more favorable prices for her personal
                              securities transactions than she gets for her clients, which is a breach of Stan-
                              dard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care. In addition, she violated Standard I(D)
                              Misconduct by failing to adhere to company policy and by hiding her personal
                              transactions from her firm. Anderb’s supervisor, Bates, violated Standard IV(C)
                              Responsibilities of Supervisors; although the company had requirements for
                              reporting personal trading, Bates failed to adequately enforce those require-
                              ments. Answer B does not represent a violation because Standard VI(B) Priority
                              of Transactions requires that personal trading in a security be conducted after
                              the trading in that security of clients and the employer. The Code and Standards
                              do not prohibit owning such investments, although firms may establish policies
                              that limit the investment opportunities of members and candidates. Answer C
                              does not represent a violation, because the Code and Standards do not contain a
                              prohibition against employees using the same broker for their personal accounts
                              that they use for their client accounts. This arrangement should be disclosed to
                              the employer so that the employer may determine whether a conflict of interest
                              exists.

                          17. The correct answer is A because this question relates to Standard I(A) Knowl-
                              edge of the Law—specifically, global application of the Code and Standards.
                              Members and candidates who practice in multiple jurisdictions may be subject
                              to various securities laws and regulations. If applicable law is more strict than the
                              requirements of the Code and Standards, members and candidates must adhere
                              to applicable law; otherwise, members and candidates must adhere to the Code
                              and Standards. Therefore, answer A is correct. Answer B is incorrect because
                              members and candidates must adhere to the higher standard set by the Code
                              and Standards if local applicable law is less strict. Answer C is incorrect because
                              when no applicable law exists, members and candidates are required to adhere to
                              the Code and Standards, and the Code and Standards prohibit the use of material
                              nonpublic information.

                          18. The correct answer is B. The best course of action under Standard I(B) Indepen-
                              dence and Objectivity is to avoid a conflict of interest whenever possible. There-
                              fore, for Ward to pay for all his expenses is the correct answer. Answer C details
                              a course of action in which the conflict would be disclosed, but the solution is
                              not as appropriate as avoiding the conflict of interest. Answer A would not be the
                              best course because it would not remove the appearance of a conflict of interest;
                              even though the report would not be affected by the reimbursement of expenses,
                              it could appear to be.

                          19. The correct answer is B. Under Standard IV(A) Loyalty, members and candi-
                              dates may undertake independent practice that may result in compensation or
                              other benefit in competition with their employer as long as they obtain consent

Solutions                                                                                   237


   from their employer. Answer C is not consistent with the Standards because the
   Standards allow members and candidates to make arrangements or preparations
   to go into competitive business as long as those arrangements do not interfere
   with their duty to their current employer. Answer A is not consistent with the
   Standards because the Standards do not include a complete prohibition against
   undertaking independent practice.

20. The correct answer is B. This question involves Standard VI(A) Avoid or Disclose
    Conflicts—specifically, the holdings of an analyst’s employer in company stock.
    XYZ ownership of the stock of the company that is the subject of the research
    report creates a conflict of interest that must be disclosed in the research report.
    XYZ could avoid the conflict by not having Smith prepare a recommendation for
    JNI or any other company in which XYZ has an ownership interest. Answers A
    and C do not describe conflicts of interest that Smith would have to avoid or dis-
    close. Answer A describes the use of a firm’s products, which would not be a re-
    quired disclosure because it will likely not create a conflict of interest. In answer
    C, the relationship between the analyst and the company through a relative is so
    tangential that it does not create a conflict of interest necessitating disclosure.

21. The correct answer is C. This question relates to Standard I(C) Misrepresenta-
    tion. Although Michelieu’s statement about the total return of his clients’ ac-
    counts on average may be technically true, it is misleading because the majority
    of the gain resulted from one client’s large position taken against Michelieu’s
    advice. Therefore, this statement misrepresents the investment performance the
    member is responsible for. He has not taken steps to present a fair, accurate, and
    complete presentation of performance. Answer B is thus incorrect. Answer A
    is incorrect because although Michelieu is not guaranteeing future results, his
    words are still a misrepresentation of his performance history.

22. The correct answer is B. The best policy to prevent violation of Standard II(A)
    Material Nonpublic Information is the establishment of firewalls in a firm to
    prevent the exchange of insider information. The physical and informational bar-
    rier of a firewall between the investment banking department and the brokerage
    operation prevents the investment banking department from providing informa-
    tion to analysts on the brokerage side who may be writing recommendations on
    a company stock. Prohibiting recommendations of the stock of companies that
    are clients of the investment banking department is an alternative, but answer
    A states that this prohibition would be permanent, which is not the best answer.
    Once an offering is complete and the material nonpublic information obtained
    by the investment banking department becomes public, resuming publishing
    recommendations on the stock is not a violation of the Code and Standards,
    because the information of the investment banking department no longer gives
    the brokerage operation an advantage in writing the report. Answer C is in-
    correct because no exchange of information should be occurring between the
    investment banking department and the brokerage operation, so monitoring of
    such exchanges is not an effective compliance procedure for preventing the use of
    material nonpublic information.

23. The correct answer is B. Under Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care,
    members and candidates who manage a company’s pension fund owe these du-
    ties to the participants and beneficiaries of the pension plan, not the management
    of the company or the company’s shareholders.

24. The correct answer is B. Answer B gives one of the two primary reasons listed in
    the Handbook for disclosing referral fees to clients under Standard VI(C) Referral
    Fees. (The other is to allow clients and employers to evaluate the full cost of the
    services.) Answer A is incorrect because Standard VI(C) does not require mem-

                              bers or candidates to discount their fees when they receive referral fees. Answer
                              C is inconsistent with Standard VI(C) because disclosure of referral fees, to be
                              effective, should be made to prospective clients before entering into a formal
                              client relationship with them.

                          25. The correct answer is B. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions does not limit
                              transactions of company employees that differ from current recommendations as
                              long as the sale does not disadvantage current clients. Thus, answer A is incor-
                              rect. Answer C is incorrect because the Standard does not require the matching
                              of personal and client trades.

                          26. Answer C is correct. Standard IV(A) Loyalty discusses activities permissible to
                              members and candidates when they are leaving their current employer; soliciting
                              clients is strictly prohibited. Thus, answer A is inconsistent with the Code and
                              Standards even with the required disclosure. Answer B is incorrect because the
                              offer does not directly violate the Code and Standards. There may be out-of-work
                              members and candidates who can arrange the necessary commitments without
                              violating the Code and Standards.

                          27. Answer A is correct. The question relates to Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence,
                              and Care. Carter believes the broker offers effective execution at a fee that is
                              comparable with those of other brokers, so he is free to use the broker for all
                              accounts. Answer B is incorrect because the accounts that prohibit soft dollar
                              arrangements do not want to fund the purchase of research by Carter. The new
                              trading scheme does not incur additional commissions from clients, so it would
                              not go against the prohibitions. Answer C is incorrect because Carter should not
                              incur unnecessary or excessive “churning” of the portfolios (excessive trading) for
                              the purpose of meeting the brokerage commitments of soft dollar arrangements.

                          28. Answer B is correct, according to Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute, the
                              CFA Designation, and the CFA Program. CFA Program candidates do not receive
                              their actual scores on the exam. Topic and subtopic results are grouped into
                              three broad categories, and the exam is graded only as “pass” or “fail.” Although
                              a candidate may have achieved a topical score of “above 70%,” she or he cannot
                              factually state that she or he received the highest possible score because that
                              information is not reported. Thus, answer C is incorrect. Answer A is incorrect
                              as long as the member or candidate actually completed the exams consecutively.
                              Standard VII(B) does not prohibit the communication of factual information
                              about completing the CFA Program in three consecutive years.

                          29. Answer C is correct. According to Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care,
                              the CFA Program would be considered a personal or firm expense and should not
                              be paid for with the fund’s brokerage commissions. Soft dollar accounts should
                              be used only to purchase research services that directly assist the investment
                              manager in the investment decision-making process, not to assist the manage-
                              ment of the firm or to further education. Thus, answer A is incorrect. Answer B
                              is incorrect because the reasonableness of how the money is used is not an issue;
                              the issue is that educational expense is not research.

                          30. Answer A is correct. Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity emphasiz-
                              es the need for members and candidates to maintain their independence and
                              objectivity. Best practices dictate that firms adopt a strict policy not to accept
                              compensation for travel arrangements. At times, however, accepting paid travel
                              would not compromise one’s independence and objectivity. Answers B and C are

                              staff members and an exclusive golf retreat for the speaker—could be viewed as

   to the speaking engagement. Should Long wish to bring other team members or
   participate in the golf outing, he or his firm should be responsible for the associ-
   ated fees.

31. Answer C is correct. The guidance to Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Infor-
    mation recommends adding securities to the firm’s restricted list when the firm
    has or may have material nonpublic information. By adding these securities to
    this list, Andrews would uphold this standard. Because waiting until the next day
    will not ensure that news of the merger is made public, answer A is incorrect.
    Negotiations between the two companies may take much longer, and the merger
    may never happen. Andrews must wait until the information is disseminated to
    the market before he trades on that information. Answer B is incorrect because
    Andrews should not disclose the information to other managers; no trading is
    allowed on material nonpublic information.

32. Answer B is correct. Through placing a personal purchase order that is signifi-
    cantly greater than the average volume, Pietro is violating Standard II(B) Market
    Manipulation. He is attempting to manipulate an increase in the share price and
    thus bring a buyer to the negotiating table. The news of a possible merger and
    confirmation of the firm’s earnings guidance may also have positive effects on the
    price of Local Bank, but Pietro’s actions in instructing the release of the infor-
    mation does not represent a violation through market manipulation. Announce-
    ments of this nature are common and practical to keep investors informed. Thus,
    answers A and C are incorrect.

33. Answer C is correct. Cupp violated Standard III(D) Performance Presentations
    when he deviated from the firm’s stated policies solely to capture the gain from
    the holding being acquired. Answer A is incorrect because the firm does not
    claim GIPS compliance and the GIPS standards require external cash flows to be
    treated in a manner consistent with the firm’s documented policies. Answer B is
    incorrect because the firm does not state that it is updating its composite poli-
    cies. If such a change were to occur, all cash flows for the month would have to be
    reviewed to ensure their consistent treatment under the new policy.

34. Answer A is correct. According to Standard V(C) Record Retention, Cannan
    needed the permission of her employer to maintain the files at home after her
    employment ended. Without that permission, she should have deleted the files.
    All files created as part of a member’s or candidate’s professional activity are
    the property of the firm, even those created outside normal work hours. Thus,
    answer B is incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because the Code and Standards do
    not prohibit using one’s personal computer to complete work for one’s employer.

35. Answer B is correct. According to Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute,
    the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program, Quinn cannot claim to have finished
    the CFA Program or be eligible for the CFA charter until he officially learns that
    he has passed the Level III CFA exam. Until the results for the most recent exam
    are released, those who sat for the exam should continue to refer to themselves as
    “candidates.” Thus, answer C is incorrect. Answer A is incorrect because mem-
    bers and candidates may discuss areas of practice in which they believe the CFA
    Program improved their personal skills.

36. Answer A is correct. Hart’s decision to invest in the retail fund appears direct-
    ly correlated with Rodriguez’s statement about the successful quarter of Mega
    Retail and thus violates Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information. Ro-
    driguez’s information would be considered material because it would influence
    the share price of Mega Retail and probably influence the price of the entire
    exchange-traded retail fund. Thus, answer B is incorrect. Answer C is also incor-

                              rect because Rodriguez shared information that was both material and nonpub-
                              lic. Company officers regularly have such knowledge about their firms, which is
                              not a violation. The sharing of such information, however, even in a conversation
                              between friends, does violate Standard II(A).

                          37. Answer C is correct. Standard VII(A) Conduct as Members and Candidates in
                              the CFA Program prohibits providing information to candidates or the public
                              that is considered confidential to the CFA Program. In revealing that questions
                              related to the analysis of inventories and analysis of taxes were on the exam,
                              Park has violated this standard. Answer B is incorrect because the guidance for
                              the standard explicitly acknowledges that members and candidates are allowed
                              to offer their opinions about the CFA Program. Answer A is incorrect because
                              candidates are not prohibited from using outside resources.

                          38. Answer B is correct. Paper has violated Standard III(D) Performance Presen-
                              tation by not disclosing that he was part of a team of managers that achieved
                              the results shown. If he had also included the return of the portion he directly
                              managed, he would not have violated the standard. Thus, answer A is incorrect.
                              Answer C is incorrect because Paper received written permission from his prior
                              employer to include the results.

                          39. Answer A is correct. Townsend has not provided any information about her
                              clients to the leaders or managers of the golf program; thus, she has not violated
                              Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality. Providing contact information
                              about her clients for a direct-mail solicitation would have been a violation. An-
                              swer B is incorrect because the notice in the newsletter does not violate Standard
                              III(E). Answer C is incorrect because the golf program’s fund-raising campaign
                              had already begun, so discussing the opportunity to donate was appropriate.

INTRODUCTION
The objective of this reading is to provide candidates with an orientation to the GIPS
                                                                                              1
standards. It explains why the GIPS standards were created, who can claim com-
pliance, and who benefits from compliance. It also covers key concepts of the GIPS
standards—composites, the definition of the firm, and the definition of investment
discretion. Finally, the reading briefly discusses the purpose and benefits of verifica-
tion. Upon completion of this reading, candidates should appreciate the benefits of an
industry-wide set of standards for calculating and presenting investment performance
based on the principles of fair representation and full disclosure.
    The 2020 edition of the GIPS standards has three chapters:
   1. GIPS Standards for Firms
   2. GIPS Standards for Asset Owners
   3. GIPS Standards for Verifiers
    Organizations that compete for business must comply with the GIPS Standards
for Firms.
    Candidates are also responsible for reading the sections of the GIPS Standards
for Firms specifically referenced in this reading. A complete copy of the 2020 GIPS

              2           WHY WERE THE GIPS STANDARDS CREATED, WHO
                          CAN CLAIM COMPLIANCE, & WHO BENEFITS FROM
                          COMPLIANCE?

                                        explain why the GIPS standards were created, who can claim
                                        compliance, and who benefits from compliance
                                        describe the key concepts of the GIPS Standards for Firms


                          The mission of the GIPS standards is to promote ethics and integrity and instill trust
                          through the use of the GIPS standards by achieving universal demand for compliance
                          by asset owners, adoption by asset managers, and support from regulators for the
                          ultimate benefit of the global investment community.
                              Institutions and individuals are constantly scrutinizing past investment perfor-
                          mance returns in search of the best manager to achieve their investment objectives.
                              In the past, the investment community had great difficulty making meaningful
                          comparisons on the basis of accurate investment performance data. Several perfor-
                          mance measurement practices hindered the comparability of performance returns from
                          one firm to another, while others called into question the accuracy and credibility of
                          performance reporting overall. Misleading practices included:
                              ■   Representative Accounts: Selecting a top-performing portfolio to represent
                                  the firm’s overall investment results for a specific mandate.
                              ■   Survivorship Bias: Presenting an “average” performance history that excludes
                                  portfolios whose poor performance was weak enough to result in termina-
                                  tion of the firm.
                              ■   Varying Time Periods: Presenting performance for a selected time period
                                  during which the mandate produced excellent returns or out-performed
                                  its benchmark—making comparison with other firms’ results difficult or
                                  impossible.
                              Making a valid comparison of investment performance among even the most
                          ethical investment management firms was problematic. For example, a pension
                          fund seeking to hire an investment management firm might receive proposals from
                          several firms, possibly from different countries, all using different methodologies for
                          calculating their results.
                              The GIPS standards are a practitioner-driven set of ethical principles that establish
                          a standardized, industry-wide approach for investment firms to follow in calculating
                          and presenting their historical investment results to prospective clients. The GIPS
                          standards ensure fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance.
                          In other words, the GIPS standards lead investment management firms to avoid
                          misrepresentations of performance and to communicate all relevant information
                          that prospective clients and investors should know in order to evaluate past results.
                              The objectives of the GIPS standards are as follows:
                              ■   Promote investor interests and instill investor confidence.
                              ■   Ensure accurate and consistent data.
                              ■   Obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for calculating and pre-
                                  senting performance.
                              ■   Promote fair, global competition among investment firms.
                              ■   Promote industry self-regulation on a global basis.

Why Were the GIPS Standards Created, Who Can Claim Compliance, & Who Benefits from Compliance?   243



Who Can Claim Compliance?
Any firm that managesactualassets may choose to comply with the GIPS standards.
Consultants cannot make a claim of compliance unless they actually manage the assets
for which they are making a claim of compliance. They can claim to endorse the GIPS
standards and/or require that their investment managers comply with the GIPS stan-
dards. Similarly, software (and the vendors who supply software) cannot be “compliant.”
Software can assist firms in achieving compliance with the GIPS standards (e.g., by
calculating performance in a manner consistent with the calculation requirements of
the GIPS standards), but only a firm managing assets can claim compliance once the
firm has satisfied all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards.
    Asset owners may comply with the GIPS standards in the same way as firms if they
compete for business. If they don’t compete for business but report their performance
to an oversight body, asset owners may choose to comply with the GIPS Standards
for Asset Owners.
    Compliance is a firm-wide process that cannot be achieved on a single product
or composite. A firm has only two options with regard to compliance with the GIPS
standards:
    1. fully comply with all requirements of the GIPS standards and claim compliance
through the use of the GIPS Compliance Statement; or
    2. not comply with all requirements of the GIPS standards and not claim compli-
ance with, or make any reference to, the GIPS standards.
    Complying with the GIPS standards is voluntary. Compliance with the GIPS
standards is not typically required by legal or regulatory authorities.


Who Benefits from Compliance?
The GIPS standards benefit firms and their prospective clients and investors, as well
as asset owners and their oversight bodies.
   ■   By choosing to comply with the GIPS standards, firms assure prospective
       clients and investors that the historical track record they report is both
       complete and fairly presented. Compliance enables the GIPS-compliant firm
       to participate in competitive bids against other compliant firms throughout
       the world. Achieving and maintaining compliance may also strengthen the
       firm’s internal controls over performance-related policies and procedures.
   ■   Prospective clients and investors have a greater level of confidence in the
       integrity of performance presentations of a GIPS-compliant firm and can
       more easily compare performance presentations from different investment
       management firms. The GIPS standards certainly do not eliminate the need
       for in-depth due diligence on the part of the client or investor, but compli-
       ance with the Standards enhances the credibility of investment management
       firms that have chosen to undertake this responsibility.
   ■   Asset owners provide performance information to their oversight bod-
       ies that allows them to make investment decisions and evaluate the per-
       formance of the funds under their supervision. Particularly where asset
       owners require their external managers to comply with the GIPS standards,
       reporting to the oversight body using the same principles facilitates the
       understanding of the sources of risk and excess return in the funds under
       supervision.

                              ■   The GIPS standards are ethical standards for investment performance
                                  presentation to ensure fair representation and full disclosure of investment
                                  performance.
                              ■   Meeting the objectives of fair representation and full disclosure is likely
                                  to require more than simply adhering to the minimum requirements of
                                  the GIPS standards. Firms should also adhere to the recommendations to
                                  achieve best practice in the calculation and presentation of performance.
                              ■   Firms must comply with all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards,
                                  including any Guidance Statements, interpretations, and Questions &
                                  Answers (Q&As) published by CFA Institute and the GIPS standards gov-
                                  erning bodies.
                              ■   The GIPS standards do not address every aspect of performance measure-
                                  ment and will continue to evolve over time to address additional areas of
                                  investment performance.
                              ■   The GIPS standards require firms to create and maintain composites for all
                                  strategies for which the firm manages segregated accounts or markets to
                                  segregated accounts. Firms must include all actual, fee-paying, discretion-
                                  ary segregated accounts in at least one composite defined by investment
                                  mandate, objective, or strategy. Pooled funds must also be included in any
                                  composite for which the pooled fund meets the composite definition. Firms
                                  must maintain and make available information about all of the strategies
                                  they manage using composites or pooled funds. These requirements prevent
                                  firms from cherry-picking their best performance.
                              ■   The GIPS standards rely on the integrity of input data, the quality of which
                                  is critical to creating accurate performance presentations. The underlying
                                  valuations of portfolio holdings drive performance. It is essential for these
                                  and other inputs to be accurate. The GIPS standards require firms to adhere
                                  to certain calculation methodologies to allow for comparability across firms.
                              Please read the Preface and the Introduction to the Global Investment Performance
                          Standards for Firms for additional insight into the history and purpose of the GIPS
                          standards.




              3           COMPOSITES

                                        explain the purpose of composites in performance reporting

                          One of the key concepts of the GIPS standards is the required use of composites. A
                          composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a sim-
                          ilar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. The requirement to create, use, and
                          maintain composites is designed to prevent firms from cherry-picking—using the
                          best-performing accounts to represent the performance of an investment strategy. A
                          composite must include all actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios managed in
                          accordance with the same investment mandate, objective, or strategy. For example,
                          if a GIPS-compliant firm presents its track record for a Global Equity Composite
                          (the Composite), the Composite must include all fee-paying portfolios that are man-
                          aged, or have historically been managed, in the firm’s Global Equity strategy. The
                          firm may not subjectively select which Global Equity portfolios will be included in
                          or excluded from the calculation and presentation of the Global Equity Composite.

Verification                                                                                      245


The determination of which portfolios to include in the Composite should be done
according to pre-established criteria (i.e., on an ex ante basis), not after the fact. This
prevents a firm from including only their best-performing portfolios in the Composite.
    A firm that claims compliance must include all fee-paying, discretionary seg-
regated accounts in at least one composite. A firm must also include all fee-paying
discretionary pooled funds in any composite for which the pooled funds meet the
composite definition.
    Please read Section 3.A. of the GIPS Standards for Firms on composites.




FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPLIANCE
                                                                                              4
               describe the fundamentals of compliance, including the
               recommendations of the GIPS standards with respect to the
               definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion

Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS standards, including prop-
erly defining the firm, providing GIPS Reports to all prospective clients and certain
pooled fund prospective investors, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and
ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. Two important issues
that a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS standards are the
definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion. The definition of the firm
is the foundation for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby
total firm assets can be determined.
    The GIPS standards state “The firm should adopt the broadest, most meaningful
definition of the firm. The scope of this definition should include all geographical
(country, regional, etc.) offices operating under the same brand name, regardless of
the actual name of the individual investment management company.”
    The firm’s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which portfolios
must be included in a composite and is based on the firm’s ability to implement
its investment strategies. If documented client-imposed restrictions interfere with
the implementation of the intended strategy to the extent that the portfolio is no
longer representative of the strategy, the firm may determine that the portfolio is
non-discretionary. Non-discretionary portfolios must not be included in a firm’s
composites.
    Section 1 of the 2020 GIPS Standards for Firms addresses the fundamentals of
compliance in more detail.




VERIFICATION
                                                                                              5
               describe the concept of independent verification

Firms that claim compliance with the GIPS standards are responsible for their claim
of compliance and for maintaining that compliance. That is, firms self-regulate their
claim of compliance. Once a firm claims compliance with the GIPS standards, it
may voluntarily hire an independent third party to perform a verification in order to

                          increase confidence in the firm’s claim of compliance. Verification may also increase
                          the knowledge of the firm’s performance measurement team and improve the con-
                          sistency and quality of the firm’s GIPS standards-related performance information.
                              Verification is a process by which an independent verification firm (verifier) con-
                          ducts testing of a firm on a firm-wide basis in accordance with the required verification
                          procedures of the GIPS standards. Verification provides assurance on whether the
                          firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled fund maintenance,
                          as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of performance, have been
                          designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and have been implemented on a
                          firm-wide basis.
                              Verification is performed with respect to an entire firm, not on specific com-
                          posites or pooled funds. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific
                          performance report.
                              Verification must be performed by an independent third party. A firm cannot
                          perform its own verification.
                              Third-party verification brings additional credibility to a firm’s claim of compli-
                          ance. A verified firm may provide existing and prospective clients and investors with
                          greater assurance about its claim of compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification
                          may also provide improved internal processes and procedures as well as marketing
                          advantages to the firm.

                              GIPS standards is referred to as a:
                              A. verification.

                              B. validation.

                              C. certification.

                          8. Firms that claim compliance with the GIPS standards are required to receive a
                             verification:
                              A. before the firm can initially claim compliance.

                              B. after the firm has claimed compliance for 12 months.

                              C. never; verification is not required.

                          9. Which of the following is not a commonly perceived benefit of the GIPS
                             standards?
                              A. Comparability of results across managers that claim compliance

                              B. Adherence to regulatory requirements

                              C. Increased confidence by investors and beneficiaries

                          10. When defining the firm, the GIPS standards recommend that firms should:
                              A. adopt the narrowest, most relevant definition of the firm.

                              B. adopt the broadest, most meaningful definition of the firm.

                              C. exclude offices operating under different brand names.

                          11. A composite return reflects the performance of:
                              A. all portfolios managed by the firm, regardless of investment strategy.

                              B. all discretionary portfolios that meet the composite definition.

                              C. all discretionary and non-discretionary portfolios that meet the composite
                                 definition.

   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. Selecting a top-performing portfolio to represent a firm’s overall
   investment results for a specific mandate, also known as using representative
   accounts, is a misleading practice that is not allowed under the GIPS standards.
   A is incorrect because including terminated portfolios is consistent with the
   GIPS standards. If the firm instead presented a performance history that excludes
   terminated portfolios, however, such a practice would be misleading and not al-
   lowed under the GIPS standards. C is incorrect because presenting performance
   for its mandate covering all periods since the firm’s inception is consistent with
   the GIPS standards. If the firm instead presented performance for a selected pe-
   riod during which it produced excellent returns or outperformed its benchmark,
   however, such a practice would be misleading and not allowed under the GIPS
   standards.

2. A is correct. Asset owners can claim compliance if they manage actual assets for
   which they are making a claim of compliance. B is incorrect because software
   (and the vendors that supply software) cannot be GIPS compliant. Software can
   assist firms in achieving compliance with the GIPS standards, but only a firm that
   manages actual assets can claim compliance. C is incorrect because a firm has
   only two options regarding compliance with the GIPS standards: fully comply
   with all applicable requirements of the GIPS standards and claim compliance
   through the use of the GIPS Compliance Statement; or not comply with all
   requirements of the GIPS standards and not claim compliance with, or make any
   reference to, the GIPS standards.

3. C is correct. A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed
   according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. For example, if
   a GIPS-compliant firm presents performance for a global equity composite (the
   composite), the composite must include portfolios that are managed, or have
   historically been managed, according to the firm’s global equity strategy. A is in-
   correct because a composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed
   according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. A composite
   may consist of a single portfolio when it is the only portfolio managed according
   to a particular investment mandate. B is incorrect because the determination
   of which portfolio(s) to include in a composite should be done according to
   pre-established criteria (ex ante basis), not after the fact (ex post basis).

4. A is correct. Verification is performed with respect to an entire firm, not on
   specific composites. B is incorrect because verification must be performed by an
   independent third party. C is incorrect because verification provides assurance
   on whether the firm’s policies and procedures related to composite and pooled
   fund maintenance, as well as the calculation, presentation, and distribution of
   performance, have been designed in compliance with the GIPS standards and
   have been implemented on a firm-wide basis; it does not ensure the accuracy of a
   specific composite presentation.

5. B is correct. Only investment management firms and asset owners (including
   pension funds, whether public or private) that manage actual assets may claim
   compliance with the GIPS standards. Software vendors and other intermediaries
   cannot claim compliance.

6. C is correct. The GIPS standards require performance to be presented for consis-
   tent, standardized time periods.

                          7. A is correct. Verification is the process of testing a firm or asset owner that claims
                             compliance with the GIPS standards, in accordance with the required verification
                             procedures of the GIPS standards.

                          8. C is correct. Firms are not required to be verified in order to claim compliance
                             with the GIPS standards, although verification is recommended and viewed as
                             best practice.

                          9. B is correct. Compliance with the GIPS standards is not typically required
                             by regulators, nor are the GIPS standards intended to cover all regulatory
                             requirements.

                          10. B is correct. Firms are encouraged to adopt the broadest, most meaningful defini-
                              tion possible of the firm.

                          11. B is correct. Composites must be defined based on investment mandate, objec-
                              tive, or strategy. Composites can include only discretionary portfolios.

                          Mandracken
                          SBS Bank (SBS) serves as a custody bank for a wide range of clients. SBS offers a variety
                          of services to its clients, including custody, clearing, payment, settlement, and record
                          keeping. SBS charges its clients an asset-based fee for these services. Pursuant to the
                          bank’s client agreement, custody clients agree to reimburse the bank for out-of-pocket
                          expenses for items paid by the custodian on their behalf. The majority of these
                          expenses are for messages sent via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
                          Telecommunication (SWIFT), a secure messaging network used by banks and other
                          financial institutions. Although SBS charges custody clients an established rate for
                          SWIFT messages, the rate is greater than the actual cost of providing this service.
                              Mandracken, CFA, a vice president at SBS who oversees client service responsi-
                          bilities, recognizes this discrepancy and brings it to the attention of his supervisor.
                          In an email, Mandracken states that “although disclosure of charging for SWIFT fees
                          is noted in the clients’ fee schedules, the fees have always included an increase over
                          actual cost, so the charge to clients is not a true pass-through because we add a mar-
                          gin.” Mandracken’s supervisor instructs him to reduce the SWIFT fee rate for new
                          clients and to revisit the rate for existing clients when their contracts are renewed.
                              To meet his obligations under the CFA Institute Code and Standards, Mandracken
                          should
                              A. implement the corrective procedures as directed by his supervisor.
                              B. implement the corrective procedures as directed by his supervisor but
                                 report his objections to the bank’s board of directors.
                              C. refuse to participate in any client interactions using the fee schedule until
                                 the bank revises the SWIFT rate to reflect the actual cost of the service.

                          Analysis
                          C is correct. This case involves how to appropriately address the misconduct of others
                          in carrying out your professional responsibilities. Standard I(A) Knowledge of the
                          Law prohibits CFA Institute members and candidates from knowingly participating
                          or assisting in legal or ethical violations and requires them to dissociate from any
                          such activity. SBS is misrepresenting its reimbursable expenses to its custody clients
                          and overcharging them. Although Mandracken brings the issue to the attention of
                          his supervisor, his supervisor’s corrective measures are inadequate because they (1)
                          address the issue only for new clients, (2) do not immediately address the issue for
                          existing clients, and (3) do not address the misrepresentation and overcharges to past
                          clients. Mandracken must thus refuse to participate in any client interactions that use
                          the fee schedule until the bank revises the SWIFT fees charged to custody clients to
                          reflect actual out-of-pocket costs.

    A is incorrect. Under the Code and Standards, Mandracken cannot continue
to participate in or be associated with this misconduct. Inaction by a member and
continuing association with those involved in illegal or unethical conduct might be
viewed as participation or assistance in the illegal or unethical conduct.
    B is incorrect. Mandracken might need to take drastic measures to dissociate from
the activity and to protect client interests, such as leaving the bank or reporting the
misconduct to the bank’s board of directors or regulators. Several interim steps should
be considered before this action, such as talking to his supervisor or the bank’s com-
pliance department about the inadequacy of the proposed corrective measures, but
Mandracken cannot continue to interact with clients using a fraudulent fee schedule.

Pellie
Pellie, CFA, is CEO of Kwaume Investment Group (KIG), an investment adviser that
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kwaume Bank. A longtime bank customer that Pellie
and some of the bank’s board members know personally recently opened an invest-
ment account at KIG with a stated investment objective of earning income. The client
made a few investments over the course of the next year, but most of the activity in
the account involved several hundred bank transactions that totaled $90 million in
deposits and $84 million in withdrawals.
     The transactions included electronic transfers to and from individuals and entities
located in bank secrecy havens and countries identified by the government as at risk
for money-laundering activity. Pellie knew that the client was engaged in international
business pursuits involving transactions with a higher risk potential for corruption and
bribery. Given the client’s longstanding relationship with the bank, Pellie assumes the
transactions have a legitimate business purpose and accepts vague descriptions, such
as “for services provided,” “consulting fees,” and “commissions.” When he receives the
daily anti-money-laundering (AML) reports, which are required by law when trans-
actions trigger red flags of potentially suspicious activity, he approves them without
further inquiry.
     Pellie’s actions are
    A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
    B. appropriate because Pellie is protecting the confidentiality of client
       information.
    C. appropriate because Pellie can rely on the account’s clearing firm to report
       suspicious activity for the account.

Analysis
A is correct. Pellie’s actions violate Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law, which states
that CFA Institute members and candidates “must understand and comply with all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations . . . governing their professional activities.” The
facts presented should have raised questions regarding the legitimacy of the client’s
account. The high volume of deposits and withdrawals combined with the low number
of investment transactions is inconsistent with an investment account having a stated
objective of earning income. The transactions in the account appeared to be high-risk
transactions for money-laundering activity and should have received a greater level of
scrutiny by Pellie. But rather than investigate as required by law, Pellie did not inquire
further because of the client’s longstanding relationship with the bank and its board
members. Pellie’s failure to comply with AML requirements imposed by law violates
Standard I(A).
    B is incorrect. The duty of loyalty to clients and the preservation of confidentiality
of client information cannot be used as justification to allow clients to violate the law
or otherwise damage the integrity or viability of global capital markets.

                              C is incorrect. Pellie cannot rely on the clearing firm to meet KIG’s obligation to
                          review the transactions for suspicious activity because that is his responsibility.

                          Mwangi
                          Mwangi, CFA, works for a firm that sells insurance products. Three of Mwangi’s clients
                          purchase one type of product (Class A) but later change their minds and ask to switch
                          to another, lower-priced product (Class B). For Mwangi to complete the transaction,
                          the law requires that she have her clients sign new sale and purchase documents for
                          the Class B product. Given that not all the documents are ready for signing at the time
                          of the clients’ request, Mwangi advises her clients to wait to sign until the complete
                          set of documents has been prepared. When the full set of documents is ready, Mwangi
                          tries unsuccessfully to reach her clients for their signatures. Because of the missing
                          signatures, Mwangi’s manager threatens to cancel the exchange, which, because of other
                          investment purchases, would place the clients’ accounts into an overdraft position.
                          Under the firm’s policies, account shortfalls are covered by selling account assets once
                          the shortfall has been outstanding for two weeks. To prevent this from happening,
                          Mwangi signs the necessary documents on behalf of her clients.
                              Mwangi’s actions are
                              A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. acceptable because her clients had already given their permission for the
                                 exchange to be made.
                              C. acceptable if the clients gave Mwangi explicit permission to sign the docu-
                                 ments on their behalf.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. This case involves Standard I(A) Knowledge of the Law, which requires
                          CFA Institute members and candidates to “comply with all applicable laws, rules, and
                          regulations . . . governing their professional activities.” To complete the exchange from
                          the Class A to the Class B product, Mwangi’s clients were legally required to sign the
                          new sale and purchase documents, which did not happen. By signing the documents
                          on behalf of the clients, Mwangi forged their signatures. This violation of the law
                          constitutes a violation of Standard I(A).
                               B is incorrect. General approval, written or verbal, of the transaction by the clients
                          is insufficient to meet the legal requirement for client signatures.
                               C is incorrect. Even if the clients fully understand what is required to make the
                          switch and explicitly give Mwangi permission to sign the forms on their behalf, the
                          law requires that the genuine signatures of the clients be on the documents. Although
                          the intent of the law is to protect the clients and the clients would be waiving their
                          rights, Mwangi is still not permitted to circumvent the legal requirements.

Myers
Myers, CFA, is a partner at Corboba, a $3 billion hedge fund that focuses on envi-
ronmental, social, and governance investments. To support upcoming public office
elections, Myers wants to personally donate $10,000 to one of the candidates, DeFrietas.
As a passionate climate advocate and an avid proponent of responsible investment,
Myers supports DeFrietas’s backing of environmental policies to reduce air pollution
and mitigate the effects of climate change. Myers believes his political contribution
might also be beneficial for Corboba because DeFrietas is running for a position that
can influence which hedge funds receive investments from the state’s pension plans.
    Myers’s best course of action is to
   A. refrain from donating to DeFrietas.
   B. donate to DeFrietas because he is using personal funds in an amount that is
      insignificant relative to the size of the hedge fund.
   C. donate to DeFrietas because he will be supporting a candidate whose envi-
      ronmental policies align with his beliefs.

Analysis
A is correct. If Myers makes the donation to DeFrietas’s campaign, his actions would
potentially violate Standard I(B) Independence and Objectivity, which states that CFA
Institute members and candidates “must not offer . . . any gift, benefit, compensation,
or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise . . . another’s inde-
pendence and objectivity.” Although Myers has a legitimate reason for donating to
DeFrietas, the facts clearly indicate that he believes the donation might also influence
DeFrietas to choose Corboba to manage money for the state’s pension plans. Standard
I(B) prohibits CFA Institute members and candidates from attempting to gain lucrative
allocations from government-sponsored pension funds by making donations to the
political campaigns of individuals directly responsible for the manager hiring decisions.
    B is incorrect. The source and the amount of the funds are irrelevant if the dona-
tion is meant to influence DeFrietas. In addition, the sum of $10,000 might be sig-
nificant in the context of the campaign and thus important to DeFrietas. The critical
issue is whether the donation is reasonably designed to improperly affect DeFrietas’s
independence and objectivity and benefit Myers or Corboba directly. Many factors
would go into this determination, including the size of the donation, Myers’s intent
in making the donation, and how influential DeFrietas’s position would be in making
the hiring decision. The facts state that one of the reasons for Myers’s donation is to
have influence over receiving investment management business from the state.
    C is incorrect. Myers seems to have both proper and improper motivations for
making a political contribution to DeFrietas. Myers supports DeFrietas’s positions
on protecting the environment and wants to further those goals. Standard I(B) is not
meant to prevent investment professionals from participating in the political process
through financial or other support for candidates. But Myers recognizes that financial
support of DeFrietas could benefit Corboba by gaining favor with someone who might
be in a position to determine whether to invest in Corboba’s fund. Therefore, Myers’
actions could be perceived as inappropriate, so the best course of action would be
to avoid any potential conflict by not donating to DeFrietas’s campaign and finding
other ways to support environmental protection policies.

                          Lee, CFA, is a financial planner for AKC. AKC compensates its planners based on
                          the number of AKC products they sell. Lee advises a married couple to transfer their
                          retirement funds totaling $125,000 into a single AKC investment fund that follows a
                          large-cap equity strategy. Lee discloses to the couple that they will have to pay a pen-
                          alty totaling $30,000 for closing their retirement accounts but claims they will make
                          up the loss with better investment returns from the AKC product.
                              Lee’s actions are
                                A. acceptable if the AKC product is suitable for the couple.
                                B. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards because she is promis-
                                   ing a specific rate of return.
                                C. acceptable because she fully discloses the negative consequences of closing
                                   their retirement accounts.

                          Analysis
                          B is correct. This case involves Standard I(C) Misrepresentation, which states that CFA
                          Institute members and candidates must not knowingly make any misrepresentation
                          related to investment analysis, recommendations, or actions. This standard prohibits
                          members and candidates from making any statements that promise or guarantee a
                          specific rate of return on volatile investments. Because the equity-based investment
                          is inherently volatile and the future return is unpredictable, Lee’s promises about
                          future returns making up for the penalty of withdrawing the funds violates Standard
                          I(C). Trust is the foundation of the investment profession. Investment professionals
                          who make false or misleading statements not only harm investors but also reduce the
                          level of investor confidence in the investment profession and threaten the integrity
                          of the capital markets.
                               A is incorrect. Even if the AKC product is suitable for the couple, it is an equity-based
                          investment that is inherently volatile. Any statements that the investment will provide
                          a certain rate of return or be worth a certain amount in the future is a misrepresenta-
                          tion. This case also raises questions about whether advising the couple to take such a
                          significant loss in their retirement savings would be in their best interest and whether
                          Lee’s independence and objectivity are compromised because her recommendation
                          is influenced by the compensation scheme of her employer.
                               C is incorrect. Although Lee fully discloses the negative consequences of trans-
                          ferring the couple’s assets to the AKC product, that disclosure does not mitigate her
                          inappropriate and misleading statement about future expected returns.

                          investment managers at his firm make an in-person proposal to manage the investments
                          of a large pension plan. In response to a request from the pension plan, Andersen
                          provides a list of the key personnel who would manage the account. While waiting
                          for the outcome of the evaluation, one of the key personnel that Andersen identified
                          and who was part of the team that made the in-person presentation leaves the firm.
                              Andersen should
                                A. do nothing because the pension plan is hiring the firm, not an individual.
                                B. immediately inform the pension plan that one of the key personnel has left
                                   the firm.
                                C. hire a competent replacement for the person who left and then inform the

Analysis
B is correct. This case relates to Standard I(C) Misrepresentation, which prohibits
members and candidates from knowingly misrepresenting anything relating to their
professional activities. After the proposal is submitted to the pension plan for its
investment management business, a staff member leaves Andersen’s team. Andersen
has identified the person leaving as a key member of the team that made the initial
presentation. Given the pension plan asked for a list of individuals who would be
handling the account, this information is clearly important in their decision to hire
Andersen’s firm. Withholding the information about the person leaving would be a
misrepresentation by omission.
    A is incorrect. Andersen obviously has confidence in the firm as a whole and will
likely replace the person leaving with a competent professional with similar experi-
ence and talent so that the transition in service is seamless for clients. The pension
plan is clearly concerned about the specific personnel involved in managing its assets
because it asked for that information. If this were a junior employee, a staff member
who had limited effect on the investment decision-making process, or someone who
was not listed as a key employee or who had not been part of the team making the
presentation, then Andersen might not need to provide an update to the pension plan.
However, given the information in the case, to avoid a misrepresentation, Andersen
must tell the pension plan about the departure of the key staff member.
    C is incorrect. Waiting until a replacement is found is too late because knowing
who the managers are on the team is clearly important to the pension plan’s hiring
decision.

Brodeur
Brodeur, CFA, is CEO of LeTour, a global company that makes electric cars. Brodeur
and LeTour disclose to the public and regulators that the company will use Brodeur’s
personal social media account to disseminate information to LeTour investors and
the investing public. After the media reports that the company is having difficulty
producing cars and delivering them to buyers, Brodeur posts on his social media that
the company is “considering taking LeTour private at $420 a share. Funding is secure.”
    Previously, Brodeur had met with a large sovereign wealth fund (SWF) that
expressed general interest in investing in the company and taking the company pri-
vate. But Brodeur and the SWF had not reached any agreement or determined a share
purchase price. Brodeur was also in discussions with investment banks but had not
yet retained any advisers to assist with taking the company private. After the post,
LeTour’s stock price increased more than 6% on significantly increased volume and
closed at $380 per share, 10% higher than on the previous day. When asked about the
specific stock price in the post, Brodeur admitted that he had not discussed pricing
with any potential investor but chose the price as a joke. Brodeur’s actions are
   A. inappropriate because the post was a misrepresentation of the facts.
   B. inappropriate because not all investors use social media, so Brodeur is selec-
      tively disclosing information and putting some investors at a disadvantage.
   C. appropriate because his post said only that he was “considering” taking
      the company private and thus contained only speculative, nonmaterial
      information.

Analysis
A is correct. This case relates to Standard I(C) Misrepresentation, which states that
CFA Institute members and candidates must not knowingly make any misrepresen-
tation relating to professional or investment activities. Brodeur’s post was based on
assumptions and contrary to the facts. Among other things, he (1) had not reached
any agreement with the SWF, (2) had never discussed a share price of $420, (3) had set

                          assist with taking the company private. Unlike market participants reading his post,
                          Brodeur knew that his supposed “secure” funding was based on a general conversa-
                          tion regarding a potential investment of an unspecified amount in the context of an
                          undefined transaction structure. Because of the uncertainties that would need to be
                          resolved before going private could be possible, Brodeur knew or should have known
                          that his statements were false and misleading. The online or interactive aspects of
                          social media do not remove the need to be open and honest about the information
                          being distributed.
                              B is incorrect. Disseminating information to investors using social media might
                          be appropriate and ethical under certain conditions. Distribution channels to make
                          information public do not need to be guaranteed to reach all investors, but they must
                          be designed to effectively make the information public. As long as the information
                          shared reaches all clients or is available to the investing public, social media plat-
                          forms would be comparable with other, traditional forms of communication, such as
                          press releases or email communication. But because the information was misleading,
                          Brodeur’s use of social media was not appropriate.
                              C is incorrect. The post can be considered “material” information and not specula-
                          tive because (1) the source of the post was the company’s CEO, (2) the subject matter
                          was dramatic and elemental, and (3) investors would want to know the information
                          before making an investment decision.


                          Misconduct
                                  Members and Candidates must not engage in any professional conduct
                                  involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects
                                  adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.


                          Hanse
                          Hanse, CFA, is a portfolio manager employed by a global investment bank. She manages
                          an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment fund. In her free time,
                          Hanse participates in civil disobedience demonstrations organized by the Extinction
                          Rebellion, a sociopolitical movement that uses nonviolent resistance to protest climate
                          breakdown, biodiversity loss, and ecological collapse. At several demonstrations held
                          in the financial district, Hanse is arrested on charges of unlawful assembly, obstructing
                          public transit, and disorderly conduct. She is ultimately convicted of several minor
                          criminal offenses. Hanse has signed a standard employment contract with the bank
                          that allows it to terminate any employee who is convicted of a criminal offense.
                              Under the CFA Institute Code and Standards, Hanse’s actions
                              A. do not violate the Code and Standards.
                              B. violate the Code and Standards because she has violated her employment
                                 contract with the bank.
                              C. violate the Code and Standards because she is arrested for misconduct in
                                 the financial district.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. This case relates to what constitutes professional misconduct. Standard I(D)
                          Misconduct prohibits CFA Institute members and candidates from engaging “in any
                          professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit” or from committing “any
                          act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.”

Professionalism                                                                               259


Generally, Standard I(D) is not meant to cover legal transgressions resulting from acts
of civil disobedience in support of personal beliefs, because such conduct does not
reflect adversely on the member’s professional reputation, integrity, or competence.
    B is incorrect. Hanse’s arrest is not likely an automatic violation of bank policies.
Although Hanse’s employment contract gives the bank the option to fire her for criminal
activity, the bank can apparently use discretion in retaining employees depending on
the nature and circumstances of the conviction. Further, the Code and Standards are
not automatically violated with every violation of an employer’s employment contract
unless the violations relate to conduct addressed in the Code and Standards.
    C is incorrect. The fact that Hanse is arrested in the financial district is not a suf-
ficient link to her professional activities to make her actions a violation of the Code
and Standards. The acts of civil disobedience by Hanse reflect her personal beliefs,
which would generally not be considered an act involving fraud, dishonesty, or deceit
or an act that reflects poorly on her professional reputation, integrity, or competence.

Mang
Mang, CFA, is an investment adviser for a regional bank that has a number of dis-
cretionary, fee-based accounts for high-net-worth individuals. The bank’s policies
permit trade error corrections up to 30 days following a failure to place a trade when
an adviser forgets to send an order to the trading desk. To rectify the error, the adviser
is permitted to buy or sell a security at the current market price, with the price differ-
ential charged to the adviser personally through an internal error account.
     On many occasions, Mang uses the trade error correction policy to benefit clients
who are unhappy with their account’s performance. Mang identifies a security whose
price has increased in the past 30 days. He then tells the trade desk he mistakenly
failed to buy that particular security some days before, when the price was substan-
tially lower than the current market price. Once the request is approved, the trade
desk purchases the security and charges the price differential to Mang personally
through the error account. Shortly after that trade, Mang sends an order to sell the
security and net a profit for the client. Mang then tells the client that he has given
them a “gift” or “no-risk” trade.
     Mang’s actions
   A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
   B. are appropriate because Mang is acting for the benefit of the client.
   C. are appropriate because the bank is not harmed by Mang’s actions.

Analysis
A is correct. Mang is violating Standard I(D) Misconduct, which prohibits CFA
Institute members and candidates from engaging in professional conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, or deceit. He is engaging in a misleading, fraudulent, and deceptive
practice and misusing the bank’s policies to enhance the performance of his clients’
accounts when no legitimate error was made. He personally compensates clients as a
means to mislead them about his ability as an investment adviser as well as the actual
performance of their accounts.
    B is incorrect. Although the trades benefit his clients, Mang is engaging in profes-
sional misconduct by misleading his clients with fraudulent and deceptive conduct.
    C is incorrect. The fact that these practices did not cause financial losses for the
bank does not make Mang’s conduct any less deceptive, fraudulent, or misleading.

                          Mahajan
                          Mahajan, CFA, is a successful research analyst for a large, global investment firm,
                          working as part of a research team covering the renewable energy sector. To further
                          his career, Mahajan applies for a new position and is hired by a boutique investment
                          research firm focusing on ESG factors and ratings. As part of the new position, Mahajan
                          will be supervising a team of several junior analysts. Although he worked with other
                          analysts at his prior positions, he has not previously had supervisory responsibility.
                          His team’s remit includes the renewable energy sector, as well as transportation
                          and construction. To prepare for his new job, Mahajan enrolls in the CFA Institute
                          Certificate in ESG Investing program, attends several webinars focusing on environ-
                          mentally friendly practices in the construction industry, engages in extensive outside
                          reading on developments in electric transportation, and joins a trade organization
                          for ESG-focused analysts.
                              With regard to meeting his responsibilities to comply with the Code and Standards,
                          Mahajan’s actions
                              A. are sufficient to comply with all his responsibilities under the Code and
                                 Standards.
                              B. fail to meet the requirements of the Code and Standards because he is not
                                 enrolled in a formal continuing education program.
                              C. fail to meet the requirements of the Code and Standards because he has not
                                 undertaken activities to obtain the skills and knowledge needed for fulfilling
                                 his new role as supervisor.

                          Analysis
                          C is correct. This case relates to Standard I(E) Competence, which requires members
                          and candidates to act with and maintain the competence necessary to fulfill their
                          professional responsibilities. Mahajan’s professional responsibilities changed when he
                          took the new position that requires competence in other skills, abilities, and knowledge
                          beyond those needed for his previous position. He will have supervisory responsibility
                          for the first time, and the industry sectors that he will be covering have expanded.
                          Standard I(E) requires Mahajan to extend his competence to cover all responsibilities
                          of his new role. Through education and self-study, Mahajan endeavors to develop
                          competence for his widening responsibility for research and analysis. However, he does
                          not take steps to obtain the skills and knowledge needed for fulfilling his supervisory
                          responsibility over the other analysts. To do this, he could have taken such steps as
                          attending conferences or taking professional development courses on management,
                          earning compliance credentials, and undergoing internal training from his firm on
                          supervisory responsibility.
                              A is incorrect. While he focuses on improving his competence on the new indus-
                          tries he will be covering as part of his new position, Mahajan does not take steps to
                          obtain the skills and knowledge needed for fulfilling his new supervisory responsibility
                          of the other analysts, as required by Standard I(E).
                              B is incorrect. Standard I(B) does not require members and candidates to par-
                          ticipate in formal continuing education or a professional development program to
                          comply with Standard I(E), although doing so would be one method of developing
                          and maintaining competence.

Khatri
Khatri, a candidate in the CFA Program, plays on a local cricket team with his friends,
including Patel, his brother-in-law and an attorney, and Ahuja, owner of a software
development company called ZeroPower (ZP). Patel handles the legal work for ZP.
Khatri, Patel, and many other friends in their circle have invested in ZP. Recently, a
large global information technology company (GIT) made an offer to buy ZP at a
substantial premium over the company’s current share price. Patel is working with
lawyers from GIT to assist in their due diligence.
    One weekend, during a particularly intense period of negotiations, Khatri, Patel,
and Ahuja are playing in a cricket tournament. Between matches, Khatri overhears
Patel speaking with representatives of GIT on his cell phone. Although mention of a
ZP acquisition is not made, Khatri hears Patel repeatedly reference the name “GIT.”
Khatri guesses that the acquisition of ZP is happening soon after seeing Patel and
Ahuja huddled in private conversation several times over the course of the weekend.
On Monday, Khatri calls his broker and increases his investment in ZP by 5,000 shares.
One week later, ZP announces its acquisition by GIT and its share price increases 30%.
    Khatri’s actions are
   A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
   B. acceptable because Khatri’s investment was based on his own speculation.
   C. acceptable because Khatri received the information in a public environment.

Analysis
A is correct. Khatri comes into possession of material nonpublic information by
overhearing confidential information from Patel’s phone calls and witnessing Patel’s
interactions with Ahuja that were prompted by those calls. Standard II(A) Material
Nonpublic Information prohibits CFA Institute members and candidates from taking
investment action based on material nonpublic information in their possession. Patel
should have been more careful to keep his phone conversations private, but his failure
to do so does not allow Khatri to use material nonpublic information received from
overhearing those conversations.

                              B is incorrect. Although information about the acquisition of ZP was not explicitly
                          stated and Khatri was required to make some degree of deduction, he knew or should
                          have known that this information was confidential, nonpublic, and material. His actions
                          are different from mosaic theory, in which investment analysts combine nonmaterial
                          and nonpublic information with public information in their analysis to derive insights.
                              C is incorrect. Although Patel’s phone calls and interactions with Ahuja take place
                          in a public environment, that does not mean the information is public.

                          Kwame
                          Kwame, CFA, is the chief financial officer of PH3D, a biotech firm that researches,
                          develops, and commercializes pharmaceutical drugs for women’s health. PH3D sub-
                          mits a drug application to the government regulator for a promising new drug. The
                          regulator postpones two scheduled meetings with PH3D when unspecified deficiencies
                          with the drug arise. The public announcement of the postponements results in a 10%
                          drop in the company’s stock price.
                              When the meeting between the regulator and PH3D finally takes place, PH3D
                          presents unpublished preliminary test data with favorable indicators for the drug. The
                          regulator reacts positively and gives PH3D provisional regulatory approval, contin-
                          gent on further studies. Afterward, some of the sell-side research analysts covering
                          PH3D ask Kwame about the meeting. Kwame responds by email, indicating that he
                          believes the meeting with the regulator was “very positive and productive” and that
                          the company was “pleasantly surprised” by the regulator’s reaction. Kwame does not
                          share the favorable preliminary test data. After Kwame’s emails to the analysts, the
                          company’s stock price increases 19%.
                              Kwame’s actions
                              A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. are appropriate because he does not share the unpublished preliminary test
                                 data with the analysts and restricts his comments to the general tenor of the
                                 meeting.
                              C. are appropriate because he responds to questions from research analysts
                                 covering the company.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. This case relates to selective disclosure of material nonpublic information.
                          Standard II(A) Material Nonpublic Information prohibits CFA Institute members and
                          candidates from causing others to act on material nonpublic information. Information
                          is material if its disclosure would affect the price of a security or if reasonable inves-
                          tors would want to know the information before making an investment decision.
                          Information is “nonpublic” until it has been disseminated or made available to the
                          marketplace in general, and Kwame’s response to select sell-side analysts inquiring
                          about PH3D’s meeting with the regulator would not be considered public dissemina-
                          tion of the information. In this case, both the drug’s positive preliminary test results
                          and the regulator’s positive reaction to the new drug is information that would have
                          an impact on the price of the security in addition to information that reasonable
                          investors would want to know.
                               B is incorrect. Although Kwame does not share the test results with the analysts,
                          he shares that the meeting with the regulator was “very positive and productive.” This
                          is information that reasonable investors would want to know.
                               C is incorrect. Kwame shares this information with a select group of analysts who
                          regularly cover PH3D and not the general investing public. The fact that Kwame is only
                          responding to questions is irrelevant. Kwame and PH3D should have issued a public
                          announcement about the meeting with the regulator before or at the same time that
                          information was disclosed to analysts.

Abbha
Abbha, CFA, is a securities contractor working to assist Superior Energy (SE) with
listing its shares on the Regional Security Exchange (RSX). SE files a prospectus for
an offer of up to 5 million shares at $2 each to raise $10 million. The RSX current
applicable listing rule requires that entities seeking admission to the RSX meet a
“minimum spread requirement” of at least 300 shareholders with a minimum value
holding to qualify for listing. In their listing application, representatives of SE inform
RSX that the minimum spread requirement of 300 shareholders has been met. These
disclosures include as shareholders 31 people or companies arranged by Abbha, though
none are actual buyers of SE securities. Abbha provides false names and addresses
for the 31 shareholders. The SE share offer raises more than $3.5 million, with more
than 1.75 million shares issued. SE is admitted to the official list of the RSX, with its
shares quoted on the exchange. Over time, the price of SE shares steadily increases,
the company attracts hundreds of investors and shareholders, and early investors
achieve an excellent investment return.
     Abbha’s actions
   A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
   B. are acceptable because SE proved to be a strong company with excellent
      performance.
   C. are acceptable because no investors were harmed by the technical violation
      of RSX rules.

Analysis
A is correct. Abbha engaged in information-based manipulation by inflating the number
of initial shareholders in SE securities to create the impression that its shares would
have sufficient liquidity and to give new investors comfort in buying them. Standard
II(B) Market Manipulation prohibits CFA Institute members and candidates from
engaging in practices that artificially inflate trading volume to mislead market par-
ticipants. To circumvent regulatory requirements and drive investor interest, Abbha’s
misrepresentations overstated initial interest in SE securities, thereby creating false
pretenses under which the company was listed.
     B is incorrect. The fact that SE ultimately proved to be a bona fide and well-performing
investment does not mitigate Abbha’s unethical, misleading, and deceitful conduct.
     C is incorrect. The purpose of the minimum spread requirement for RSX security
listings is to demonstrate that investor interest in a company is sufficient to justify the
company’s listing. Th minimum spread requirement ensures some level of liquidity
at the time a company is listed and prevents lower-quality applicants that are unable
to attract sufficient investor interest from being listed. Falsifying the number of
initial investors goes beyond a technical violation of RSX rules and has substantial
consequences.

                          Maste
                          Maste, CFA, is the sole director of Dov Services (Dov), a firm that sells financial prod-
                          ucts and advice. Maste directs Dov’s authorized representatives to incorporate the
                          Dov Client Protection Policy into their contracts with clients. The protection policy,
                          which sets forth the terms for providing financial advice, states that it “contains a
                          number of client protections designed to ensure that you (the client) receive the best
                          possible advice and the maximum protection available under the law.” The protection
                          policy’s terms (1) excuse Dov and its authorized representatives from various liabil-
                          ities arising from their failure to act in a client’s best interest, (2) relieve Dov and its
                          authorized representatives of their duty to conduct suitability analyses of clients and
                          investments, and (3) lead clients to believe that they cannot make claims against Dov
                          or its representatives for violating securities law.
                              Maste’s actions
                              A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. are appropriate because Dov and Maste fully disclose the terms of the Dov
                                 Client Protection Policy to clients.
                              C. are appropriate because Dov and Maste are free to negotiate the terms of
                                 advisory agreements with clients.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. The terms of the Dov Client Protection Policy improperly attempt to use
                          disclosure to relieve Dov and Maste of their fundamental ethical (and very likely legal)
                          obligations to clients by limiting liability for failures to act in the client’s best interests
                          or to provide appropriate advice. Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care sets
                          forth a duty of loyalty on the part of CFA Institute members and candidates to their
                          clients and requires them to act for the benefit of their clients and to place their clients’
                          interests before their own. In addition, Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis
                          requires members and candidates to provide diligent, independent, and thorough advice
                          and to have a reasonable and adequate basis for investment action; Standard III(B)
                          Fair Dealing requires members and candidates to conduct a suitability analysis for
                          any investment recommendation to their clients; and Standard I(C) Misrepresentation
                          says that members and candidates cannot make any misrepresentations relating to

Duties to Clients                                                                             265


investment services. These components of the CFA Institute Code and Standards
define the fundamental principles applicable to investment professionals and detail
the conduct investors should expect from their financial advisers.
    B is incorrect. Disclosure cannot be used to relieve advisers of their fundamental
ethical obligations to clients. The Dov Client Protection Policy is also deceptive because
it misrepresents the client’s right to bring legal action for ethical and regulatory viola-
tions and appears to give the false impression that a client would benefit from its terms.
    C is incorrect. Although in general, clients and advisers are free to negotiate the
terms of advisory agreements, for advisers to use the client agreement to create a
significant imbalance between the rights and obligations of the adviser and the client
or to limit the fundamental ethical obligations of loyalty, prudence, and care to the
client is improper.

Gaini
Gaini, CFA, is a commodities trader with a number of retail clients, including Laube,
who opens a self-directed foreign exchange retail account for which Gaini does not
advise on any trades. Laube signs Gaini’s standard customer agreement, which contains
provisions relating to margin requirements and liquidation in the event of margin
deficits. The agreement authorizes Gaini, at his discretion, “to liquidate, without notice,
any or all open positions in an account with insufficient margin.”
    Laube initially purchases two 100,000 US dollar/Swiss franc (USD/CHF) contracts
and sets her margin requirement to $4,000. Laube then places two additional 100,000
USD/CHF “pending limit” orders that will execute if the contract trading prices reach
a specified level. Each order has a different limit price, so one will execute before the
other. Shortly after placing the orders, Laube goes on an extended vacation. While
she is away, execution on the first limit order occurs, and the margin requirement
increases to $6,000. Then, the next limit price is reached, and the second order executes,
increasing the margin requirement to $8,000. After the trades, while Laube is still on
vacation, her account balance drops to $6,900. Without notice, Gaini liquidates all
positions in Laube’s account, realizing a loss of $37,000 from the liquidation.
    Gaini’s actions
    A. are appropriate because Gaini followed the policy and procedures set forth
       in Laube’s client agreement.
    B. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards because Gaini has a duty to
       act in the best interest of Laube by protecting her financial position.
    C. are inappropriate because Gaini could have met the margin requirement by
       liquidating only one foreign exchange contract position.

Analysis
A is correct. This case relates to Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care, which
imposes on CFA Institute members and candidates a duty to act with loyalty, pru-
dence, and care in their clients’ best interests and in relation to other clients and the
markets. However, the conduct that fulfills this responsibility depends on the nature
of the relationship with the client. Laube self-directs her trades, which are executed by
Gaini, who does not provide investment advice. Additionally, Laube freely contracts
with Gaini regarding the consequences of insufficient margins in her account, and
these policies and procedures are clearly set forth in her client agreement. Nothing
indicates that Gaini misled Laube about the margin requirements or the liquidation
procedures. Although the contractual provision authorizing liquidation without notice
does not waive Laube’s right to be dealt with in good faith, the margin and liquidation
provisions are not an attempt by Gaini to waive his duty of loyalty, prudence, and care.
They simply set forth the parameters of the relationship, which Gaini and Laube are

                          free to negotiate. Although Laube suffered significant trading losses, Gaini liquidated
                          Laube’s open positions in accordance with the terms of the customer agreement,
                          serving to protect the integrity of the market.
                              B is incorrect. Given the facts of this case, Gaini’s responsibility to protect his own
                          financial position and that of his other customers supersedes any duties he owes to
                          Laube when she defaults on the margin requirements. Because of the limited nature of
                          the relationship between Laube and Gaini, Gaini is not obligated to actively monitor
                          Laube’s account to protect her financial interests. Doing so would require Gaini to
                          continuously monitor a potentially deteriorating market or to take on additional risk
                          management measures that he has not agreed to and that Laube has not contracted for.
                              C is incorrect. Gaini is not obligated to use a less drastic alternative by closing
                          only one foreign exchange contract position and does not breach a duty to Laube by
                          liquidating all open positions when the parties have contractually agreed that total
                          liquidation to meet a margin deficit may be done at Gaini’s discretion without notice.

                          Braung
                          A regional government hires Braung, CFA, and his firm to serve as its financial adviser
                          for issuing general obligation bonds. The municipality conducts several bond offerings
                          over the years for constructing municipal facilities, including a maximum-security
                          detention facility and two school buildings. In connection with the bond issues,
                          Braung makes a number of trips to New York City to meet with ratings agencies. The
                          trips are typically planned for a Monday or Friday because the costs for weekend
                          travel are less. Braung’s wife accompanies him on the trips, and they typically spend
                          the weekend either before or after the meetings in New York City to enjoy sporting
                          events, theater performances, and museums. Braung often makes a number of train
                          and hotel changes after a trip is booked to accommodate meetings with other clients.
                          Braung submits his travel expenses to his supervisor, who deducts costs she believes
                          are unrelated to the business purpose of the trip and submits the bills to the munic-
                          ipality for reimbursement.
                              Which of the following expenses can most likely be billed to the government
                          entity issuing the bonds?
                              A. Braung’s accommodation and meal expenses for the weekend days because
                                 the travel rates are less expensive over a weekend
                              B. Tickets to the sporting and theater events, as long as they do not exceed a
                                 reasonable amount for business entertainment
                              C. Flight and hotel change fees that result from the regular course of Braung’s
                                 business activities

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. This case relates to Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care, which
                          states that CFA Institute members and candidates have a duty of loyalty to their clients,
                          must act for their clients’ benefit, and must place client interests before their own.
                          Under this standard, investment professionals, including municipal security dealers,
                          must not engage in any deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practice when handling client
                          accounts. The savings in travel fees for booking a weekend travel schedule could be
                          greater than the additional accommodation and meal expenses for Braung to stay the
                          extra days in New York City, making the cost to the client lower. Under these circum-
                          stances, Braung would be meeting his duty of loyalty to the client by choosing the
                          most inexpensive travel schedule overall, thus limiting costs to the client. Charging
                          personal theater and sporting event tickets or travel change fees associated with see-
                          ing unrelated clients would not qualify as chargeable expenses to the client. The best
                          scenario would be to detail in writing at the outset of the engagement which expenses
                          would be considered reimbursable.

Duties to Clients                                                                           267


    B is incorrect. In the context of conflicts of interest, the CFA Institute Code and
Standards allow members and candidates to accept or provide modest gifts and
entertainment in the ordinary course of business (a gift basket at the holidays from
a vendor or to a client, for example). But that “ordinary course of business” does not
allow investment professionals to charge clients for obviously extraneous entertainment
expenses not connected to a business meeting. Charging excessive or lavish expenses
for the personal benefit of the investment professional at the expense of the client
can constitute a deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practice that violates Standard III(A).
    C is incorrect. Although busy investment professionals might be forced by other
priorities to change travel arrangements when a client trip has already been sched-
uled, additional expenses resulting from the change most likely must be borne by
the investment professional (Braung) as an overhead cost, not charged to the client.
(Under some limited circumstances, those expenses might be charged to the client
who necessitates the travel changes.)


Fair Dealing
        Members and Candidates must deal fairly and objectively with all clients
        when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations,
        taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities.


Scherzer
Scherzer, CFA, is the head of research at a large investment management firm. She
publishes monthly “Recommendation Update Reports” to communicate to clients
any investment recommendation changes her firm has made. The reports are sent
to clients via email on the first Friday of the month and posted on the firm’s website
the following Monday. The firm’s internal policy is that a change in recommendation
can only be made once a month through this report. Scherzer also publishes weekly
reports with information gathered by analysts that might implicitly signal a future
change in recommendation or lead a reader to infer that a recommendation will be
changing. Although the monthly “Recommendation Update Reports” are sent to all
clients, clients who wish to receive the weekly publication must pay an annual fee
of $1,000. This option is available to any client and is fully disclosed as part of every
client agreement.
    To comply with the CFA Institute Code and Standards, Scherzer is required to
    A. do nothing because her actions comply with the Code and Standards.
    B. publish the monthly report on the firm’s website at the same time it is sent
       to clients.
    C. send the weekly reports to all clients at no additional charge.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard III(B) Fair Dealing requires CFA Institute members and candi-
dates to deal fairly and objectively with all clients when providing investment analysis
and making investment recommendations. It also requires that information about
investment recommendations be disseminated in such a manner that all clients have
a fair opportunity to act on the information. Scherzer distributes the recommendation
update reports to all clients simultaneously via email, giving each an opportunity to act
on the information. Scherzer is also not limited by the Code and Standards in commu-
nicating with clients about investments only when an investment recommendation is
provided and can provide updated or clarifying information to clients as appropriate.
In addition, Scherzer does not violate the Code and Standards by providing weekly
reports to clients who pay a subscription fee for the service as long as (1) all clients

                          to clients, and (3) no change in recommendations is made that would disadvantage
                          existing clients who receive only the monthly report.
                              B is incorrect. The Code and Standards do not require Scherzer to publish the
                          reports to the public on the firm’s website.
                              C is incorrect. The Code and Standards allow CFA Institute members and candidates
                          to provide more personal, specialized, or in-depth service to clients who are willing
                          to pay for premium services through additional fees as long as (1) those services do
                          not disadvantage other clients who do not pay additional fees, (2) the differing levels
                          of service are disclosed to clients, and (3) the services are made available to all.


                          Suitability
                              1. When Members and Candidates are in an advisory relationship with a cli-
                                 ent, they must:

                                  a. Make a reasonable inquiry into a client’s or prospective client’s invest-
                                     ment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints
                                     prior to making any investment recommendation or taking investment
                                     action and must reassess and update this information regularly.

                                  b. Determine that an investment is suitable to the client’s financial situa-
                                     tion and consistent with the client’s written objectives, mandates, and
                                     constraints before making an investment recommendation or taking

                                 to a specific mandate, strategy, or style, they must make only investment
                                 recommendations or take only investment actions that are consistent with
                                 the stated objectives and constraints of the portfolio.


                          Marte
                          Marte, CFA, is an asset manager in Puerto Rico, a US territory. Residents of Puerto Rico
                          receive significant tax advantages when they invest in local securities. To capitalize on
                          this advantage, Marte’s firm offers its clients shares in a closed-end investment fund,
                          organized under Puerto Rico’s financial laws and regulations, that holds at least 67%
                          local securities and is permitted to borrow against up to 50% of its assets. The fund
                          is usually leveraged to the extent legally permitted. Many of Marte’s clients have a
                          modest net worth and conservative or moderate investment objectives. Marte con-
                          vinces them to invest 85% or more of their assets in shares of the closed-end fund.
                              Marte’s actions
                              A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. are appropriate because they take advantage of the fund’s unique tax bene-
                                 fits for his clients.
                              C. are appropriate as long as Marte fully discloses the risks and benefits of the
                                 fund to his clients.

Duties to Clients                                                                          269


Analysis
A is correct. Standard III(C) Suitability states that CFA Institute members and can-
didates in an advisory relationship with clients must “determine that an investment
is suitable to the client’s financial situation and consistent with the client’s written
objectives, mandates, and constraints before making an investment recommendation
or taking investment action.” Given the financial circumstances and conservative
investment objectives of his clients, the high concentration of the fund’s shares in
his clients’ accounts, combined with the leverage, makes the large investment in the
fund unsuitable because greater portfolio diversification is needed. Despite the tax
advantages, highly concentrated investments carry an increased risk that a single
market event affecting the value of the fund’s shares would significantly decrease the
total account value. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that the closed-end fund is
internally leveraged, which could magnify the fund’s loss during a market event that
causes share values to drop steeply.
    B is incorrect. Given the favorable tax advantages of the investment vehicle,
investment in shares of the closed-end fund might be suitable and appropriate for his
clients at some level. But given the financial circumstances and investment objectives
of his clients, the high concentration, combined with the leverage, makes the large
investment in the fund unsuitable.
    C is incorrect. Although Marte should always fully disclose the risks and benefits
of his recommendations to his clients, doing so does not take away the need for the
investment to be suitable for the clients’ financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and
investment goals.

Duri
Duri, CFA, is a registered account representative providing financial advice to retail
clients. She is also a principal partner of Tabak Accountants. Duri assists a number of
advisory clients who want to move their retirement assets from existing superannua-
tion (pension) accounts to self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) that have the
goal of investing in direct residential property. When clients express interest in these
types of SMSFs, Duri accepts their reasons for wanting to invest in direct property and
assumes that they have the time and expertise to manage their superannuation affairs.
She reclassifies their investment objectives as “growth” to match the new investment
strategy. Duri charges her clients for establishing the SMSFs and recommends that
her firm, Tabak Accountants, prepare the clients’ annual accounts and tax returns.
    Duri’s actions
    A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
    B. are acceptable because she is following the directives of her clients.
    C. are acceptable if the services provided by Tabak Accountants are reasonable
       and the costs of services are competitive.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard III(C) Suitability requires CFA Institute members and candidates
in an advisory relationship to make a reasonable inquiry into a client’s investment
experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints to determine whether
an investment is suitable for the client’s financial situation and consistent with the
client’s objectives and mandates before taking investment action. When Duri’s clients
want to move their retirement assets into an SMSF that invests in direct residential
property, Duri appears to accept their reasoning without conducting a suitability
analysis. The case does not indicate whether Duri did any of the following:
    ■   Assess the reasons a client wants to invest in direct property
    ■   Consider the client’s financial goals

                              ■   Compare the benefits, risks, and costs associated with establishing an SMSF

                              ■   Consider asset diversification
                              ■   Determine whether the client intends to draw a pension from the SMSF
                                  once the individual reaches retirement or how the client will do that with an
                                  illiquid asset, such as investment property
                              ■   Evaluate whether the client has the time and expertise to manage his or her
                                  superannuation affairs, including managing a rental property
                              ■   Consider whether the SMSF investment strategy will remain viable if the
                                  client’s income is reduced or the property is unoccupied for a period of time
                              Without analyzing these and other factors, for Duri to move her clients to the
                          SMSFs would be inappropriate.
                              B is incorrect. If her clients request a change in their investment strategy, Duri has
                          a responsibility as their investment adviser to conduct an analysis to ensure that the
                          new direction is suitable and appropriate. Duri appears to have classified all clients as
                          growth investors to superficially justify their investment in an SMSF vehicle without
                          analyzing whether this classification was an accurate assessment.
                              C is incorrect. Duri appears to be recommending that her firm provide clients with
                          accounting services for the SMSF investments to create additional income for herself.
                          But Standard III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care requires members and candidates
                          to act for the benefit of their clients and to place their clients’ interests before their
                          own. At a minimum, Duri’s relationship with Tabak must be fully disclosed to clients
                          as a potential conflict of interest.

                                  Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is fair, accurate,

                          Jergenn
                          Jergenn, CFA, is the portfolio manager for the Volare Investment Management (VIM)
                          fund, a registered collective investment scheme (CIS) organized under the laws of
                          South Africa. VIM’s 2022 regulatory disclosure and marketing material for the fund,
                          produced by Jergenn, presents annual investment performance data for the 2014–20
                          period that is accurate and calculated correctly. The performance history is that of
                          a composite of separate accounts that followed the strategy used by the VIM fund
                          before the assets were moved over to the CIS environment in 2021.
                              In presenting the fund’s performance history, Jergenn’s actions
                              A. violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. are appropriate because the investment performance is accurate.
                              C. are appropriate as long as the performance calculations are net of fees.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. Standard III(D) Performance Presentation states that CFA Institute
                          members and candidates must make a reasonable effort to ensure that investment
                          performance information is fair, accurate, and complete. Although the performance
                          information presented by Jergenn is calculated correctly and includes technically
                          accurate data, Jergenn’s failure to indicate clearly that the performance data applied

Duties to Clients                                                                           271


to a period before the VIM fund was registered as a CIS has the potential to mislead
investors into believing that the CIS fund had a long track record. To meet the “fair,
accurate, and complete” requirement of the standard, Jergenn should disclose that
the 2014–20 performance history was for a prior but similar entity with the same
investment strategy and objectives and that the VIM fund, as a CIS, has been in
existence only since 2021.
    B is incorrect. Although the performance is accurate and correctly calculated, the
lack of disclosure about the nature of the accounts makes the presentation misleading.
    C is incorrect. Performance can be presented either net or gross of fees as long as
investors are sufficiently informed about how the performance is calculated and what
effect fees might have on the returns.


Preservation of Confidentiality
        Members and Candidates must keep information about current, former,
        and prospective clients confidential unless:

    1. The information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client or pro-
       spective client,
    2. Disclosure is required by law, or
    3. The client or prospective client permits disclosure of the information.


Giddings and Marsh
Giddings, CFA, is responsible for compliance at GWH, a large broker/dealer and
investment adviser. In connection with GWH’s wealth management business, the
company maintains personally identifiable information (names, addresses, phone
numbers, account numbers, balances, and holdings) of its clients. Giddings adopts
a number of policies and restrictions, including a Code of Conduct, that address
employees’ access to and handling of this confidential information. Marsh, CFA, who
works for GWH as a client services associate, decides to download client data to his
personal server located at his residence to facilitate his telecommuting. Marsh’s server
is hacked, and portions of the personal client information Marsh downloaded are
posted for sale on the internet.
    Did either Marsh or Giddings violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards?
    A. Marsh violated the Code and Standards.
    B. Giddings violated the Code and Standards.
    C. Both Marsh and Giddings violated the Code and Standards.

Analysis
C is correct. Standard III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality requires that CFA Institute
members and candidates keep information about current, former, and prospective
clients confidential unless the information concerns illegal activities, disclosure is
required by law, or the client permits disclosure. Although the standard does not
require investment professionals to be information security experts, they must make
reasonable efforts to prevent the accidental distribution of confidential information
by following compliance procedures. Assuming Marsh did not have permission to
download client data to his personal server, his misappropriation of client informa-
tion for his own purposes is a violation of Standard III(E). And although he was not
responsible for the distribution of the information, his misconduct facilitated the
publication of the information. Marsh needed to understand and follow the firm’s
electronic information communication and storage procedures.

                          He is responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of customer information, protecting

                          Although GWH has policies restricting access to and handling of client information,
                          the extent of those safeguards was apparently insufficient because Marsh was able to
                          download company files to his personal computer. The fact that client information
                          was accessed and published makes the effectiveness of Giddings’s compliance efforts
                          questionable. Even if the policies were sufficient, nothing indicates that Giddings
                          audited and/or tested the effectiveness of the safeguards meant to keep client infor-
                          mation confidential.

                          Nickoli
                          Nickoli, CFA, is an investment counselor with HHI Capital Management (HHI). A
                          colleague at her local society encourages Nickoli to leave HHI and join her at Vesuvius
                          Asset Advisers. Nickoli eventually agrees and decides to leave at the beginning of the
                          new year. In the weeks before submitting her resignation, she tells her clients that
                          they will likely be working with a new investment counselor because she is leaving
                          HHI. Her clients express surprise, and when asked for details about why she is leaving,
                          Nickoli shares that she is frustrated by the firm’s structure, disagrees with the direction
                          the firm is going, lacks confidence in the current leadership, doubts the firm will be
                          able to attract and retain good people, and believes other HHI employees have been
                          mistreated and will also be leaving soon. Several of Nickoli’s HHI clients indicate that
                          they would like information about Vesuvius and might be interested in switching their
                          accounts. After submitting her resignation, Nickoli immediately shares the names of
                          the interested clients with Vesuvius, and after the first of the year, she begins soliciting
                          them to transfer their accounts from HHI to her new firm.
                              Nickoli’s conduct is
                              A. a violation of the Code and Standards.

   B. acceptable because she did not solicit clients until after she left HHI.
   C. acceptable because she is looking out for her clients’ best interests and
      believes Vesuvius provides better service.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard IV(A) Loyalty states that CFA Institute members and candidates
“must act for the benefit of their employer and not . . . otherwise cause harm to their
employer.” Although a departing employee is generally free to make arrangements or
preparations to change firms before terminating the relationship, those preparations
must not conflict with the employee’s continued duty to act in the best interests of
the current employer and not otherwise undermine, disparage, or cause harm to that
employer. In this case, Nickoli decides to leave HHI and join Vesuvius weeks before
she notifies the firm and submits her resignation. During that time, Standard IV(A)
obligates her to continue to act in her current employer’s best interests and not engage
in any activities that would conflict with this duty until her resignation becomes effec-
tive. Nickoli violates her duty of loyalty to HHI by making disparaging and harmful
statements about the firm to its clients in the weeks before she submits her resignation
and by promoting Vesuvius to HHI clients while she is still employed by HHI.
    B is incorrect. Although she did not make actual solicitations until after she left
HHI, Nickoli used the final weeks of her employment with HHI to determine which
of the firm’s clients might be interested in receiving information about Vesuvius and
possibly transferring their accounts from HHI and then contacted them after her
move to Vesuvius.
    C is incorrect. Although investment professionals should protect their clients’ best
interests, even if Nickoli believes the clients will be better off with her at Vesuvius,
the clients’ relationship is with HHI. She is a representative of HHI, so she must not
act in a manner harmful to the firm while still employed there.

Kuznetsov
Kuznetsov, CFA, is a portfolio manager for a medium-sized investment firm that
encourages its employees to sell proprietary investment products to their clients.
Kuznetsov begins selling these investment products, and within a year, he becomes
the firm’s top seller of the products. He receives glowing performance reviews and a
large bonus. However, Kuznetsov begins to realize that the firm’s investment products
are underperforming and are more expensive than other, external investment options
that are suitable for his clients and present stronger growth opportunities. He stops
selling the firm’s investment products to his clients. Although his supervisor puts
increasing pressure on him to resume selling the firm’s products, Kuznetsov refuses.
He complains several times to management that he is being pressured to place the
firm’s interests above his clients. He secretly records several conversations with his
supervisor and makes copies of client records that document what he considers
inappropriate conduct by his supervisor. When management ignores his complaints
and Kuznetsov’s supervisor begins giving him poor performance reviews, he files a
complaint with the local regulator against his supervisor and his firm, providing the
recordings and copies of client files as evidence. After the firm becomes aware of
Kuznetsov’s actions, he is fired.
    Kuznetsov’s actions are
   A. appropriate because he is protecting his clients’ interests.
   B. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards because he fails to keep
      client information confidential.
   C. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards because he violates his
      duty of loyalty to his employer by taking his dispute with his supervisor to
      the regulator and exposing the employer to financial and reputational harm.

                          “must act for the benefit of their employer and not . . . divulge confidential informa-
                          tion, or otherwise cause harm to their employer.” But occasionally, circumstances
                          might arise in which investment professionals need to engage in conduct contrary
                          to their employer’s interests to protect clients’ interests. In pressuring Kuznetsov to
                          sell more expensive, suboptimal investment products to his clients, the employer is
                          acting in its own interests and not in the clients’ best interests. Kuznetsov is clearly
                          acting in the best interests of the clients by notifying the regulators of his employer’s
                          unethical practices.
                              B is incorrect. Copying client records to give to the regulator is a justifiable step
                          for Kuznetsov to take to protect his clients’ interests.
                              C is incorrect. In general, Kuznetsov’s decision to record conversations with his
                          supervisor and report the employer to the regulator is justified because he is attempting
                          to protect his clients’ interests by calling out his employer’s unethical (and possibly
                          illegal) conduct. However, certain jurisdictions might have laws against recording
                          conversations without the other party’s consent. Under these circumstances, his
                          “whistle-blowing” activity is not a violation of the Code and Standards.

                          Clemence
                          Clemence, CFA, is a wealth management adviser for DeLaurier Strategic Advisers,
                          where she is responsible for financial planning and wealth management for more than
                          400 retail clients. She met many of her clients through her spouse, who is a well-known
                          attorney, and her sister, who is a physician. Clemence decides to leave DeLaurier to take
                          a position at another firm, where she will not be expected to generate new advisory
                          clients but will take on more research and investment management responsibilities.
                          She leaves DeLaurier on good terms, providing her supervisor with all the background
                          and information to seamlessly transition her clients to a new account manager. Not all
                          of Clemence’s clients have sufficient assets under management to become clients at
                          her new firm. On the day Clemence leaves DeLaurier, she downloads a spreadsheet of
                          DeLaurier’s clients, prospects, and former clients and sends it to her personal email.
                          The list includes names, assets under management, addresses, and phone numbers.
                          Clemence intends to contact her clients as a courtesy to inform them of her new
                          position, thank them for being clients, and express her confidence that DeLaurier
                          will continue to provide them with competent and professional service even though
                          she has left the firm.
                              Clemence’s actions are
                              A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. appropriate because she is protecting the interests of her clients.
                              C. appropriate as long as she contacts only those clients who are personal
                                 friends to inform them of her new position.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. Standard IV(A) Loyalty requires that CFA Institute members and candi-
                          dates “act for the benefit of their employer and not . . . divulge confidential information,
                          or otherwise cause harm to their employer.” Clemence has violated her duty of loyalty
                          to her employer by downloading the client list and taking it with her for use after she
                          leaves DeLaurier. The client list is DeLaurier’s property. The list also contains propri-
                          etary confidential information about DeLaurier clients that Clemence is improperly
                          using for her own purposes, no matter how well intentioned those purposes might
                          be. Clemence could have asked her employer’s permission to send a “thank you” note
                          to her clients immediately before leaving DeLaurier, thus eliminating the need to take
                          client information with her.

    B is incorrect. Clemence is clearly not motivated to use the client list and informa-
tion to benefit her new firm but appears rather to be working for DeLaurier to protect
the interests of her former clients and make them feel comfortable in continuing to
use DeLaurier as their financial adviser. But in obtaining information about her cli-
ents, Clemence goes too far and also takes more information than perhaps intended.
In addition to information about her clients she has also obtained information about
the firm’s former, current, and prospective clients.
    C is incorrect. Clemence may contact her former clients who are friends through
personal channels, such as social media or a personal contact, but she cannot use
DeLaurier’s property to facilitate this communication. As an alternative, she could
ask DeLaurier’s permission to take her clients’ contact information so she can send
them a final “thank you” correspondence.


Additional Compensation Arrangements
       Members and Candidates must not accept gifts, benefits, compensation,

       written consent from all parties involved.


Estevez
Estevez, CFA, is a senior research analyst at BIR, a boutique investment research firm
covering micro- and small-cap companies that hire BIR to provide research coverage
(called issuer-paid research) to promote their stock to investors. Because of BIR’s
stellar reputation, its research services are in high demand among both investors and
companies seeking potential investors. Estevez helps BIR select the companies it covers
and oversees a team of junior research analysts. Some companies encourage Estevez
to select their company for BIR research coverage by giving her a separate bonus if
they are included in the BIR research universe. Estevez’s actions are
   A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards because her indepen-
      dence and objectivity in conducting the research are compromised.
   B. acceptable as long as Estevez does not use material nonpublic information
      from the company.
   C. acceptable as long as her company approves in writing the payments offered
      by covered companies.

Analysis
C is correct. Standard IV(B) Additional Compensation Arrangements requires members
and candidates to obtain written consent from their employer before they accept any
gift, benefit, or compensation that “might reasonably be expected to create a conflict
of interest with their employer’s interest.” Estevez receives a benefit from companies
that BIR selects to receive research coverage. Estevez’s involvement in the process
of choosing the companies that BIR agrees to research presents a conflict of interest
because she might favor those companies that pay her the bonus. Estevez would
have to disclose to her company that she is receiving the benefit from the selected
company, and BIR would have to disclose to the users of the report that the company
paid Estevez the bonus and is paying for the research coverage.
    A is incorrect. Issuer-paid research itself is not automatically unethical nor does
it automatically compromise an analyst’s independence and objectivity. However, this
area is filled with potential conflicts, so important safeguards must be observed. BIR
must adopt strict procedures to protect the analyst’s objectivity from being influenced
by the company. Such safeguards must also include full disclosure of any conflicts

                          of interest on the part of the analyst conducting the research; full disclosure of any
                          compensation arrangements, including the source of the payment for the research;
                          and policies that separate the research recommendations from the level or nature of
                          the payment.
                              B is incorrect. Even if she is not using material nonpublic information from the
                          company, this does not alleviate Estevez’s need for full disclosure and employer consent
                          regarding her bonuses from companies.


                          Responsibilities of Supervisors
                                  Members and Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure that
                                  anyone subject to their supervision or authority complies with applicable
                                  laws, rules, regulations, and the Code and Standards.


                          Duhih
                          RC Group (RCG) is a registered futures commission merchant with several branch
                          offices, including one in Memphis, Tennessee (USA). Duhih, CFA, is hired to be the
                          branch manager of the Memphis office, supervising several employees, including
                          Lewes, CFA. Duhih allows Lewes to work from home, so Lewes does not have a phys-
                          ical workspace in the Memphis office or even access to the building, and Duhih only
                          occasionally checks in with Lewes regarding work. Unknown to either Duhih or RCG,
                          Lewes also works for another futures commission merchant, called AFCM. Lewes
                          arranges swap agreements for AFCM, including orders with several cattle feed yard
                          clients. Working with another employee at RCG, Lewes opens new futures accounts
                          for the feed yard clients that RCG represents. Although the other RCG employee
                          receives all the commissions for the accounts, she secretly splits them with Lewes.
                          Duhih is unaware of Lewes’ participation in this commission-sharing arrangement.
                              Duhih’s actions as a supervisor are
                              A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. acceptable if the RCG headquarters conducts regular audits of the Memphis
                                 branch.
                              C. acceptable if RCG did not develop adequate policies and procedures for the
                                 detection and deterrence of possible employee misconduct.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors states that members
                          and candidates “must make reasonable efforts to ensure that anyone subject to their
                          supervision or authority complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the
                          Code and Standards.” At a minimum, supervisors must make reasonable efforts to
                          detect and prevent legal, regulatory, and policy violations by ensuring that effective
                          compliance systems have been established. Although the case does not clearly pres-
                          ent what steps Duhih took to diligently exercise supervisory responsibility, the fact
                          that Lewes works from home and did not have access to the branch office suggests
                          that Duhih’s supervision is minimal at best and noticeably ineffective. In addition,
                          Duhih should support his company by encouraging it to adopt a code of ethics, have
                          clearly written compliance policies and procedures, and conduct employee training
                          on appropriate ethical behavior.
                              B is not correct. A regular audit of the Memphis branch by compliance personnel
                          from RCG headquarters could be an excellent way to ensure that branch employees
                          are complying with applicable law, regulations, and RCG policies. However, it would
                          not be a substitute for effective and regular supervision by Duhih, the onsite branch
                          manager.

Duties to Employers                                                                         277


     C is incorrect. Supervisors must understand what constitutes an adequate com-
pliance system and make reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate compliance
procedures are established, documented, communicated to covered personnel, and
followed. If Duhih knew that RCG did not have adequate policies and procedures
for detecting and deterring potential employee misconduct, he was obligated to tell
management about the shortcoming, help develop adequate compliance policies, or
decline supervisory responsibility. A lack of adequate policies is not an excuse for
failing to detect potential misconduct by RCG employees, including Lewes. Duhih
should not have accepted supervisory responsibility until he understood not only
RCG’s policies and procedures but also the company’s expectations of him with regard
to maintaining his subordinates’ compliance with them.

Denikin & Denikin
Sasha Denikin, CFA, began his investment career as a research analyst for Galak
Investment Partners, a company founded and controlled by his father, Franz Denikin,
CFA. After several years, Franz transfers ownership of Galak to Sasha, who becomes
a director of the company. Franz tells the firm’s clients that he retains management
of all client accounts. When the longtime chief compliance officer (CCO) announces
her retirement, Sasha is promoted to CCO. While Sasha has no previous compliance
experience, the plan is for the prior CCO to retain compliance responsibilities as a
consultant while mentoring and training Sasha. Despite his title, Sasha has no actual
authority to supervise his father’s conduct, and Franz continues to exert absolute
control over Galak. Sasha also does not have permission to contact clients or review
Galak communications with clients because his father insists that all client contact go
through him. During his tenure as CCO, Sasha raises multiple compliance issues with
his father regarding his father’s actions, but Sasha is powerless to enforce company
policies and procedures concerning his father’s conduct. After continuing to serve as
Galak CCO for a time, Sasha finally resigns in frustration.
    Sasha Denikin’s actions are
   A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
   B. acceptable because Franz holds the actual power and client responsibilities
      at the firm and thus cannot be under the supervision of a subordinate.
   C. acceptable because Sasha resigns as CCO when he is frustrated by his
      inability to exercise his compliance responsibilities.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard IV(C) Responsibilities of Supervisors requires CFA Institute
members and candidates to “make reasonable efforts to ensure that anyone subject to
their supervision or authority complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the
Code and Standards.” Members and candidates with supervisory responsibility must
make reasonable efforts to prevent and detect violations by ensuring that effective
compliance systems are established. If they cannot carry out their supervisory respon-
sibilities because of an inadequate compliance system, they should decline in writing
to accept the supervisory responsibility until the firm adopts reasonable procedures
to allow for the adequate exercise of that supervisory responsibility. Sasha knows
that he is not qualified to serve as CCO of Galak but still accepts the role. As CCO,
Sasha has supervisory responsibility for all firm employees in compliance matters.
However, Sasha has difficulty performing his CCO duties because the firm’s structure
gives him no real authority over his father to ensure that his father’s conduct complies
with internal policies and regulatory rules. Sasha knows that his father is ignoring
firm rules, but despite being CCO and a director of the company, Sasha has no real
authority or ability to supervise and influence Franz’s conduct.

                              B is incorrect. Franz’s status as the founder and the one truly controlling the
                          company does not exempt him from oversight by the CCO.
                              C is incorrect. If Sasha is unable to fulfill his responsibilities because of an inade-
                          quate compliance system or a lack of experience, he should refuse the CCO role until
                          he has been fully trained and Galak adopts procedures allowing him to effectively
                          exercise supervisory responsibility over his father. For example, Sasha could work with
                          the outgoing CCO to establish a compliance program that includes a code of ethics,
                          compliance policies and procedures, education and training programs, an incentive
                          structure rewarding ethical behavior, and firmwide best practice standards to help
                          meet his supervisory obligations. However, Sasha chooses to quit the CCO job and
                          resign from the firm only after a significant period during which he fails to adequately
                          meet his supervisory responsibilities and, likely, the best interests of the firm’s clients.

                          nabidiol (CBD) products. To promote the company, the Corix CEO hires Harrel, an
                          independent research analyst and CFA Program candidate, to write and distribute a
                          research report on the company. The CEO tells Harrel the following:
                              ■   Corix has an agreement with indigenous tribes that allows it to access tribal
                                  lands for commercial hemp and cannabis farming and to sell hemp and can-
                                  nabis products in retail outlets on tribal lands.
                              ■   Corix has a certificate of compliance from the national regulator that
                                  permits the company to transport, process, and export industrial hemp
                                  products.

    Harrel includes all this information in a research report and provides a positive
analysis of the company. However, Corix does not have agreements with indigenous
tribes, nor does it have regulatory approval—the certificate of compliance is a forgery—
and Corix never cultivated or harvested significant quantities of commercial hemp.
    Chong, a CFA charterholder and research analyst at Nature’s Harvest Investment
Management (NHIM), incorporates the information and conclusions from Harrel’s
research report into his own research on Corix and includes a “buy” recommendation
on the company. Chong’s report is distributed to portfolio managers at NHIM. Corix is
ultimately shown to be a fake operation, leading to substantial losses for NHIM’s clients.
    Which individual(s) most likely violated the CFA Institute Code and Standards?
   A. Harrel only
   B. Chong only
   C. Both Harrel and Chong

Analysis
C is correct. Standard V(A) Diligence and Reasonable Basis states that CFA Institute
members and candidates must exercise diligence and thoroughness in analyzing
investments and must have a reasonable and adequate basis that is supported by
appropriate research and investigation for any investment recommendation. Harrel
and Chong do not meet the requirements of this standard. By relying on the statements
given by Corix and not conducting an independent investigation into the accuracy
of the information, Harrel did not exercise diligence and thoroughness in analyzing
the company. Chong seemingly relied on Harrel’s research to formulate his “buy”
recommendation without conducting his own independent research. Investment
professionals who rely on third-party research must make reasonable and diligent
efforts to determine whether that research is correct. The facts do not indicate that
Chong independently verified the information, critically assessed Harrel’s research, or
had reason to rely on Harrel’s report based on past experience and familiarity with the
quality of Harrel’s work. In addition, Harrel works as an independent researcher and
thus has no management structure that could enforce due diligence standards, which
should raise concerns about the quality of Harrel’s due diligence. Chong also did not
recognize that Harrel’s work was issuer-paid research and thus subject to increased
scrutiny. NHIM should have had clear due diligence policies and procedures in place
that Chong would need to follow before completing and disseminating research on
behalf of the firm.
    A is incorrect. Both Harrel and Chong violated the Code and Standards.
    B is incorrect. Both Harrel and Chong violated the Code and Standards.

                          Dukis
                          Dukis, CFA, is a managing director at a global credit ratings service. She is responsible
                          for the group that assigns new issue and surveillance credit ratings to commercial
                          mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). To determine the ratings, Dukis and her group
                          calculate the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of each security, a key quantitative
                          metric used to rate CMBSs. Shortly after the global financial crisis, the ratings agency
                          changes its methodology for calculating the DSCR for certain securities so that it more
                          accurately reflects risk. Dukis’s group publishes subsequent credit ratings without dis-
                          closing the change. When the new methodology is used, the securities receive higher
                          credit ratings than they would have received if the original methodology had been used.
                              Dukis’s actions are
                              A. appropriate because the new methodology more accurately reflects risk.
                              B. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards because she did not
                                 disclose the change in methodology to the investing public.
                              C. appropriate because no disclosure is necessary, given that calculating DSCR
                                 is only one element in determining the overall rating of the security.

                          Analysis
                          B is correct. Standard V(B) Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients
                          requires CFA Institute members and candidates to disclose to investors the basic for-
                          mat and general principles of the investment process they use to analyze investments,
                          as well as any changes that might materially affect those processes. Ratings agencies’
                          consistency and transparency are important to investors. If rating methodologies are
                          not applied consistently, ratings might not be easily comparable. Similarly, without
                          transparency, investors cannot assess the methodologies used by the credit ratings
                          agency or the application of those methodologies, which means they cannot deter-
                          mine how much weight to give the rating. Dukis should have disclosed to investors
                          the change in methodology for calculating the DSCR.
                              A is incorrect. Even if the new methodology does more accurately reflect risk, the
                          change must still be communicated to investors.
                              C is incorrect. The DSCR is clearly a key quantitative metric used to rate the
                          securities because the change in methodology materially affected the credit ratings
                          by rating them higher than the original method. A change in such a key factor must
                          be disclosed.


                          Record Retention
                                  Members and Candidates must develop and maintain appropriate records
                                  to support their investment analyses, recommendations, actions, and other
                                  investment-related communications with clients and prospective clients.


                          Duermott
                          Duermott, CFA, is president of Enhanced Investment Strategies (EIS), a small invest-
                          ment firm. Most clients of EIS are longtime associates of Duermott who have had
                          their investment portfolios with the firm for decades. Because of his close personal

Conflicts of Interest                                                                           281


relationship with his clients, Duermott is very familiar with their investment profile,
income and retirement requirements, and risk tolerance. He keeps up with all his
clients’ life-changing events—such as health issues, real estate purchases, children’s
university expenses, and retirement—and adjusts the clients’ portfolios accordingly.
Duermott regularly meets with his clients at EIS’s offices, and he also sees them on
numerous occasions outside the office, which gives him additional opportunities to
update them on their investments. EIS clients complete a client agreement and risk
profile when opening their account, and those profiles are updated whenever Duermott
finds the time to do so.
    Duermott’s business practices are
    A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
    B. acceptable because he regularly communicates with clients about their
       investments.
    C. acceptable because he adjusts clients’ investments to ensure that they are
       suitable for the clients’ needs given their changing income and risk profile.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard V(C) Record Retention states that CFA Institute members and
candidates must “develop and maintain appropriate records to support their investment
analyses, recommendations, actions, and other investment-related communications
with clients and prospective clients.” In this case, Duermott is personally close to his
clients, but he updates client records only when he “finds the time to do so,” which
does not appear to be promptly or regularly. Duermott has a responsibility as his
clients’ adviser and as the president of his company to maintain appropriate records
when client circumstances change. Without necessary, relevant, and up-to-date
know-your-client information, Duermott would have difficulty establishing and proving
that EIS has identified the needs and circumstances of its clients and has taken them
into account in recommending investments. When client circumstances, investment
goals, risk tolerances, or income needs change, records should be promptly updated,
and they should be reviewed regularly to document these changes.
    B is incorrect. Although Duermott is fulfilling his ethical obligations as an invest-
ment manager by communicating regularly with his clients, he is not keeping regular,
up-to-date client records.
    C is incorrect. Although Duermott is reviewing and adjusting client portfolios
on a timely basis to meet clients’ changing financial circumstances, he is not keeping
regular, up-to-date client records.

                          Reebh
                          Reebh, CFA, is the CEO and founding partner of Lux Asset Management (Lux). Reebh
                          provides asset management and allocation services for high-net-worth individuals
                          and several small institutional clients. His services include investing client funds
                          with third-party subadvisers who have a specialty in a particular asset class. Reebh’s
                          clients are aware and approve of Lux’s allocation of their assets to subadvisers. The
                          third-party subadvisers make payments to Lux based on the total value of a client’s
                          assets placed or invested in the subadvisers’ funds.
                              Reebh’s actions are
                              A. appropriate because Reebh has disclosed the use of subadvisers.
                              B. inappropriate because the payments are an improper referral fee.
                              C. inappropriate unless Reebh discloses the financial arrangement he has with
                                 the subadvisers to his clients.

                          Analysis
                          C is correct. Standard VI(A) Avoid or Disclose Conflicts requires CFA Institute mem-
                          bers and candidates to “avoid or make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could
                          reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or interfere with
                          respective duties to their clients.” The payments subadvisers make to Lux based on the
                          value of the client assets Lux places with the subadvisers creates a potential conflict of
                          interest because Reebh is thereby incentivized to hire subadvisers who pay the fee but
                          who might not necessarily be the best subadvisers for his clients. Reebh can avoid this
                          conflict by not agreeing to this compensation structure. If Reebh continues to accept
                          payment in this manner, Reebh must disclose the financial arrangement to clients.
                              A is incorrect. Reebh has disclosed Lux’s use of subadvisers, but he has not dis-
                          closed the financial arrangement for Lux to use those subadvisers.
                              B is incorrect. Although referral arrangements might be acceptable with full dis-
                          closure to clients, Reebh is not referring clients to the subadvisers but is hiring them
                          directly on his clients’ behalf.


                          Priority of Transactions
                                  Investment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over

                          adviser. While employed with Dacco, Yang establishes Prestige Trade Investments
                          Limited (Prestige) and acts as investment adviser for the firm’s clients. Yang is respon-
                          sible for formulating Prestige’s investment strategy and directs all trades on behalf of

Prestige. Over several days, Yang purchases 50,000 shares of Zhongpin stock and 1,978
Zhongpin call options for his personal account at Dacco. Shortly after, Yang uses $29.8
million of Prestige’s funds to purchase more than 3 million shares of Zhongpin stock.
   Yang’s actions are
    A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
    B. acceptable because Yang’s personal investments are not in conflict with the
       investment advice being given to his clients at Prestige.
    C. acceptable as long as Prestige clients are not negatively affected by Yang’s
       prior purchase of Zhongpin securities through his account at Dacco.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions states that “investment transac-
tions for clients . . . must have priority over investment transactions in which a [CFA
Institute] Member or Candidate is the beneficial owner.” Yang is “front-running” his
Prestige clients’ trades. Front-running involves trading for one’s personal account
before trading for client accounts. Yang purchases Zhongpin stock and call options
in his personal account at Dacco before directing the Zhongpin trades for clients at
Prestige. The $29.8 million of Prestige funds invested in Zhongpin stock could have
a material upward effect on the price of the stock and options Yang holds. Even the
perception that Yang could profit by using Prestige’s funds will diminish investors’
trust in Yang and the capital markets.
    B is incorrect. Yang’s personal investments are tracking with his client investments,
so no conflict exists between his personal trading and the investment actions/advice
for clients. However, the timing of the trades is the issue in this case because Yang is
“front-running” his clients’ trades.
    C is incorrect. The fact that Prestige clients are not harmed by Yang’s earlier trades
for his personal accounts does not make his actions acceptable.

Kapadia
Kapadia, CFA, is a trader for an asset management company that manages several
large global mutual funds. Kapadia executes the equity buy-and-sell orders for the
portfolio managers of one of the company’s mutual funds. He has the discretion to
execute the orders at any time during the day, depending on market conditions. Before
executing the orders, Kapadia contacts several close friends and relatives to give them
information on which securities the mutual fund will be trading. In turn, these friends
and relatives make trades that mirror the imminent trades to be executed by Kapadia
on behalf of the mutual fund.
    Kapadia’s actions are
    A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
    B. inappropriate only if the client is harmed financially by the conduct.
    C. appropriate because he does not share confidential information about indi-
       vidual clients.

Analysis
A is correct. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions states that “investment trans-
actions for clients must have priority over investment transactions” for a member or
candidate’s personal benefit. Kapadia is facilitating front-running by his friends and
relatives on the trades of his employer’s mutual fund. Front-running is the unethical
and often illegal practice of trading on advance information for one’s personal account
before trading for client accounts to gain an economic advantage. Although Kapadia
might not directly benefit financially, he benefits personally by providing the infor-
mation to those with whom he has close relationships.

                              B is incorrect. Kapadia’s engagement in the practice of front-running, which
                          involves trading in personal accounts before trading for client accounts, is unethical
                          and inappropriate even if the trades of Kapadia’s friends and relatives do not disad-
                          vantage the mutual fund by moving the price of the security or causing the fund to
                          lose the price advantage or any profit from its own trades.
                              C is incorrect. Although Kapadia does not share the confidential information
                          of individual clients or individual investors in the fund, he does share confidential
                          information about the fund itself.

                          Perrkins, CFA, is the chief investment officer of GT Financial (GTF). Perrkins’s wife is
                          GTF’s compliance officer. GTF has several dozen retail clients and total assets under
                          management of $70 million. All client assets are managed on a discretionary basis.
                          Perrkins frequently makes trades for his clients using an omnibus trading account
                          through a broker/dealer, which allows Perrkins to buy and sell securities in a block
                          trade on behalf of multiple clients simultaneously. Perrkins regularly allocates the
                          securities purchases to individual client accounts after the market closes. Over one
                          six-month period, Perrkins allocates 75% of the profitable trades to nine accounts
                          that Perrkins and his wife own or control. At the same time, he allocates 82% of the
                          unprofitable trades to the account of the three largest GTF clients.
                              Perrkins’s actions are
                              A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.
                              B. acceptable as long as he discloses the trade allocation practices to his clients.
                              C. acceptable as long as he reverses his trade allocation practices to favor the
                                 larger clients so that they are not harmed over the long term.

                          Analysis
                          A is correct. Standard VI(B) Priority of Transactions states that investment transactions
                          for clients have priority over personal transactions. By trading in the firm’s omnibus
                          account and then delaying the allocation of trades to a specific account until he has
                          an opportunity to observe the security’s intraday performance, Perrkins can pick the
                          winning trades for accounts in which he has a beneficial interest. This practice is a
                          violation of Standard VI(B). He then allocates the losing trades to clients’ accounts
                          that are large enough to absorb incremental trading losses without arousing suspi-
                          cion that the losses are due to fraud. Perrkins’s actions are also likely a violation of
                          Standard III(B) Fair Dealing, which states that members and candidates “must deal
                          fairly and objectively with all clients when . . . taking investment action or engaging
                          in other professional activities.”
                              B is incorrect. Disclosure to his clients as to how he is allocating the trades does
                          not make Perrkins’s unethical, fraudulent behavior acceptable.
                              C is incorrect. Perrkins cannot temporarily favor his personal interests over his
                          clients’ interests with the intent of rectifying the situation for his clients in the future.
                          Ethical conduct is not subject to a ledger-keeping exercise. CFA Institute members
                          and candidates must comply with the ethical principles and requirements of the Code
                          and Standards at all times.

Kiang
Kiang, CFA, is a successful investment adviser with several high-net-worth clients
who are very happy with his services. Many of Kiang’s clients recommend his advisory
services to their friends and family, and Kiang encourages these recommendations
to build his business. Each year, Kiang hosts an elaborate party for clients who have
referred new clients to his advisory firm. At the party, Kiang distributes nominal gift
cards to attendees. In some cases, Kiang offers discounts on advisory fees to clients
who sent him referrals that proved particularly lucrative. Many of the clients attending
these celebrations were referred to Kiang by other clients, and they, in turn, continue
the cycle of recommending Kiang to a wider circle of friends and family.
    Kiang’s actions most likely are
   A. acceptable as a reward for client loyalty.
   B. acceptable because he treats all clients fairly.
   C. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards.

Analysis
C is correct. Standard VI(C) Referral Fees states that members and candidates “must
disclose to their employer, clients, and prospective clients, as appropriate, any com-
pensation, consideration, or benefit . . . paid to others for the recommendation of . .
. services.” In this case, Kiang hosts an elaborate party, distributes gift cards, and, in
some cases, offers discounted advisory fees to clients who have referred particularly
lucrative clients. Under the standard, these benefits would be considered referral fees
that must be disclosed. The facts do not indicate that Kiang makes any disclosure to
potential clients. The fact that some prospects, upon becoming clients, become aware
that he pays for referrals when they receive discounted fees is insufficient disclosure.
It would be acceptable if Kiang were to host a party or give gift cards to all his clients
to reward their loyalty, regardless of whether they provided referrals.
    A is incorrect. The party, gift cards, and discounted advisory fees are more than a
reward for client loyalty and would be considered referral fees that are provided only
to existing clients for recommending Kiang’s services.
    B is incorrect. Arguably, Kiang treats his clients fairly because he offers all of his
clients the opportunity to receive these benefits and fee discounts as long as they
refer others to his business, and whether the clients access these benefits by making
referrals is up to them. However regardless of whether Kiang is treating all clients
fairly, he is violating Standard VI(C) by not disclosing the benefits and compensation
he awards for referrals.

                          Taveras
                          Taveras, CFA, leads an exam preparation course sponsored by his local society. The
                          society hosts a celebration for the students after the exam is over. During the celebra-
                          tion, several of Taveras’s students describe their experience of taking the exam. Most
                          give their opinion on the relative difficulty of the exam compared to their expectations,
                          and some describe their surprise about areas of the curriculum that were not tested.
                          Taveras asks his students for their opinions on the most difficult exam questions.
                              Under the CFA Institute Code and Standards, Taveras is most likely
                              A. prohibited from discussing the exam with students after it is over.
                              B. free to pass along information about the exam to candidates in future prep
                                 courses to help prepare them for the exam.
                              C. allowed to share the opinions of his students about the difficulty of the exam
                                 with candidates in future prep courses to emphasize the need to thoroughly
                                 prepare.

                          Analysis
                          B is correct. Standard VII(A) Conduct as Participants in CFA Institute Programs states
                          that candidates “must not engage in any conduct that compromises . . . the integrity,
                          validity, or security of CFA Institute programs.” For Taveras to share with future prep
                          course participants the opinions of his previous students who found the CFA exam
                          more difficult than expected is acceptable as a way to encourage future students to
                          study the curriculum thoroughly and prepare as much as possible. However, Tavares
                          should not solicit or pass on information regarding the specifics of the exam.
                              A is incorrect. A group of candidates who collectively completed the rigorous
                          process of studying for and taking the CFA exam will naturally want to celebrate the
                          accomplishment and discuss the exam after it is over. Candidates are allowed to discuss
                          their exam experience with Taveras in general terms, but they cannot provide specific
                          information about the exam regarding the questions or the general areas tested.
                              C is incorrect. Taveras cannot pass along specific information to future candidates
                          and should not be soliciting information about specific questions; doing so would be
                          a violation of Standard VII(A), which is designed to protect the integrity and security
                          of future exams.

Ahmed
Ahmed recently earned his CFA designation and joined a medium-sized hedge fund
as a senior analyst. His supervisor, Bennett, the firm’s founder, earned her CFA des-
ignation 10 years ago and proudly uses the CFA designation on her business card
and on all marketing materials for the fund. Bennett shares with Ahmed that she has
not paid her CFA Institute membership dues for the past four years and no longer
participates in the organization’s continuing education program. When Ahmed asks
Bennett about her use of the designation, she states that by passing the CFA exam,
she earned the CFA charter and that the credential is like a university degree that
cannot be taken away. Later, during a marketing meeting the two have with a potential
investor, the investor notes that he narrowed his manager search to only firms that
employ CFA charterholders in senior positions. When he asks Bennett if everyone
in the firm on the investment side is a CFA charterholder, she responds, “Yes, that is
correct.” Ahmed does not respond.
    Did either Ahmed or Bennett violate the CFA Institute Code and Standards?
   A. Ahmed violated the Code and Standards, but Bennett did not.
   B. Bennett violated the Code and Standards, but Ahmed did not.
   C. Both Ahmed and Bennett violated the Code and Standards.

Analysis
C is correct. Standard VII(B) Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the
CFA Program states that when referring to the CFA designation, members and candi-
dates “must not misrepresent . . . holding the CFA designation.” The CFA designation
is not like a degree from a university, because once individuals have been granted the
right to use the designation, they must also satisfy CFA Institute membership require-
ments, which include paying dues, to maintain the right to refer to themselves as CFA
charterholders. Participation in the CFA Institute Professional Learning program is
not mandatory for members to maintain their designation, but it is encouraged as a
way to meet the CFA Institute Code of Ethics provision that members maintain and
improve their professional competence. Bennett’s membership is considered lapsed
because she has not been paying dues to CFA Institute. Until she reactivates her
membership, Bennett is violating Standard VII(B) by continuing to use the CFA desig-
nation and representing herself as a charterholder to a potential client. Ahmed knows
that Bennett’s CFA Institute membership has lapsed. Standard I(A) Knowledge of the
Law prohibits members and candidates from knowingly participating or assisting in
the violations of others and requires members and candidates to dissociate from any
unethical or illegal conduct. By staying silent in a sales meeting in which he knows
false information is being given to a potential investor that could cause harm to that
investor, Ahmed would be seen as assisting Bennett in providing that false informa-
tion, even though Ahmed is not actively engaging in the misconduct himself. Best
practice would be for Ahmed to address Bennett directly about her conduct and ask
her to reinstate her membership or correct the statement she made to the potential
investor. If Bennett refuses to take corrective action, Ahmed should report her conduct
to the fund’s compliance department for it to address and should dissociate himself
from the activity by not participating in any additional sales meetings with Bennett.
    A is not correct, because both Ahmed and Bennett violated the Code and Standards.
    B is not correct, because both Ahmed and Bennett violated the Code and Standards.
