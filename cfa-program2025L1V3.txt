                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​

    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the

       the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
       later review.
           Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
       exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
       and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




       ERRATA
       The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
       reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
       errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
       updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
       error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
       reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

INTRODUCTION
This learning module introduces the Corporate Issuers topic area, which covers the
                                                                                           1
fundamentals of how corporations are organized and governed and how they make
operating, investing, and financing decisions. Financial analysts must have a strong
understanding of corporate issuers because they are the largest type of issuer in finan-
cial markets globally; many analysts are focused entirely on analyzing and investing
in their debt or equity instruments. In the first lesson of this module, we describe and
compare the legal organizational forms of businesses, emphasizing their similarities
and differences and important implications for investors. The second lesson focuses
on the corporate organizational form and its key features, such as the separation of
ownership and management, limited shareholder liability, access to financing, and tax
issues. In the final lesson, we compare privately held and public corporate issuers,
including the mechanisms of how corporate issuers go public and are taken private.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Businesses are legally organized as sole proprietorships,
          partnerships, or limited companies, which differ by several
          attributes, including legal identity, owner–manager relations, owner
          liability, taxation, and access to financing. In practice, organizational
          forms are jurisdiction specific; our focus is on common characteristics.
      ■   The limited company form, often known as the corporation, offers
          advantages over the other two forms by improving the ability to raise
          capital, through limited shareholder liability, the separation of own-
          ership and management, and fewer restrictions on the number of

                                   owners and transferring ownership. In most jurisdictions, there are
                                   two types of limited companies: private limited companies and public
                                   limited companies.
                               ■   Private limited companies tend to have some restrictions on own-
                                   ership but pass-through taxation like partnerships. Public limited
                                   companies have no ownership restrictions, but their income can be
                                   taxed at both the company and shareholder level. While public lim-
                                   ited companies do not have to go public by selling their shares on an
                                   exchange, it is this form that is most suitable for becoming a publicly
                                   traded company.
                               ■   Corporate shareholders elect a board of directors that appoints execu-
                                   tive management to operate the company. Shareholders effect change
                                   primarily through their ability to replace directors.
                               ■   Corporations that seek external financing in financial markets, known
                                   as corporate issuers, can utilize either public or private markets, and
                                   these choices have implications for the liquidity and price transpar-
                                   ency of the company’s securities, as well as its ability to raise future
                                   financing and the degree to which it must disclose information.
                               ■   Corporate issuers can change their status from privately held to pub-
                                   licly traded (or “listed”) through a variety of mechanisms, including
                                   an initial public offering. Publicly traded issuers can be taken private
                                   through several mechanisms, including a leveraged buyout.
                               ■   Shareholders of corporate issuers include not only individuals and
                                   institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds, but
                                   also governments, non-profits, and other corporations.



                         LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this topic.

                           1. Fill in the two blanks below using the two of the following four possible
                              terms:

                               Sole proprietorship

                               General partnership

                               Limited partnership

                               Public limited company (corporation)


                              A _____________________ likely has the greatest access to financing, while a
                              _____________________ likely has the least access to financing.
                              Solution:
                              A public limited company (corporation) likely has the greatest access to
                              financing, while a sole proprietorship likely has the least access to financing.
                              A primary difference across organizational forms is access to financing to
                              fund investments. The sole proprietorship is limited to its individual owner’s
                              ability to invest her own money and borrowing capacity as an individual. At
                              the other end of the spectrum, a public limited company can access a broad
                              array of outside investors by issuing debt and/or equity securities.

Introduction                                                                            5


  2. Which of the following organizational forms provides for the least owner
     liability of business debts?
      A. General partnership
      B. Private limited company
      C. Sole proprietorship
     Solution:
     B is correct. In both the sole proprietorship and general partnership forms
     of organization, the owners are personally liable for all debts assumed by
     the company. In a private limited company, owner (shareholder) liability is
     limited to the value of their ownership stake.

  3. Voting rights of a corporate issuer’s shareholders generally refer to which of
     the following?
      A. The ability of the corporation to vote in political elections
      B. The direct ability to elect a chief executive officer of the company
      C. The ability to elect members of the company’s board of directors
     Solution:
     C is correct. The voting rights of shareholders generally allow them to elect
     board members as well as vote on other matters outlined in the company’s
     charter. The board of directors has the responsibility to hire (or retain) the
     company’s chief executive officer (CEO); thus, voting rights do not give
     shareholders the direct ability to hire the CEO. Despite the status of a corpo-
     ration as a distinct legal entity, this status does not provide voting rights in

  4. Explain how the following situation reflects double taxation on the corpo-
     rate organizational form: The corporation pays a 21% tax rate on pre-tax
     income of USD100 million. The corporation distributes USD10 million to its
     shareholders. Individuals pay a 20% tax on dividend income.
     Solution:
     The corporation pays USD21 million in income taxes at the corporate level
     and, collectively, the shareholders pay USD2 million in individual income
     taxes on dividends received. In total, USD23 million in income taxes were
     paid on the pre-tax income of USD100 million. Effectively, the USD10 mil-
     lion paid as dividends was taxed twice, first as business income and again as
     personal income.

  5. True or false: The term “public” for a public corporate issuer means that the
     company is wholly or partially owned by a government.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     B is correct. The statement is false because while a public corporate issuer
     could be owned partly by a government, this condition is not necessary. The
     term “public” refers only to the fact that a company’s equity securities are
     traded on an exchange and thus are available for investment by the public.

            2           ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS OF BUSINESSES

                                         compare the organizational forms of businesses

                        In most market economies, there are three general types of organization, each with
                        distinct purposes, stakeholders, and governing legal frameworks: for-profit orga-
                        nizations, known as businesses or companies; not-for-profit non-governmental
                        organizations, or simply non-profits; and governments.
                            The focus of this and subsequent modules are businesses, because financial ana-
                        lysts are important participants in the markets for their financial resources. However,
                        non-profits and governments often are investors in businesses, which will be covered
                        in later lessons. Governments as issuers of debt and other securities are covered in
                        modules on fixed income.


                        Organizational Forms of Businesses
                        Business owners choose a legal organizational form that defines how returns, risks,
                        and ownership and operational responsibilities are distributed. There are three general
                        forms common to most jurisdictions.



                           Exhibit 1: Organizational Forms of Businesses


                                                      Businesses          Non-Profits          Governments

                              Proprietorship




                        The organizational forms of businesses differ by several attributes:
                            ■    Legal identity: Whether the business is legally considered a separate entity
                                 or person apart from its owners
                            ■    Owner–manager relationship: The relationship between the owner(s) of the
                                 business and those who manage the business

    ■   Owner liability: The extent to which owners are personally legally liable for
        actions or debts undertaken by the business
    ■   Taxation: The treatment of business profits or losses for tax purposes
    ■   Access to financing: The ability to raise capital to fund expansion and distrib-
        ute risks
    Every jurisdiction has its own specific versions and variants of organizational forms,
including different names for them. We are not attempting to provide an exhaustive
treatment of jurisdictional specifics; rather, we provide the general and common
attributes that analysts must know to ask the right questions in their own research
on specific investment candidates and business cases.


Sole Trader or Proprietorship
The simplest organizational form is the sole trader or proprietorship, shown in Exhibit
2. In a sole proprietorship, the owner provides the capital needed to start and operate
the business and retains full control over management, while participating fully in
the firm’s financial returns and risks. In some jurisdictions, this form is the default
form, requiring no formal legal registration, and is dissolved when the owner ceases
business activity or dies.

                                   Proprietorship



                          Unlimited                  Individual controls
                           liability                business operations



                                       Individual




An example of a sole proprietorship is a family-owned business. The individual owner
usually uses savings or a personal loan to start the business and to run daily operations
and retains full management control. The owner retains all return (profits), which is
taxed as personal income, and is personally responsible for losses and obligations of
the business, such as debts.
    While sole proprietorships comprise the largest number of businesses in most
market economies and are preferred by small business owners for their simplicity
and flexibility, their growth is constrained by an owner’s ability to access financing,
assume risk, and serve as the sole owner.


Partnerships
Partnerships allow multiple owners to pool their resources and share business risk
and return. There are three common types in most jurisdictions: general partnerships,
limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.
    A general partnership, shown in Exhibit 3, has two or more owners called partners
or general partners (GPs). General partnerships are like sole proprietorships, with the
important distinction that they allow for additional resources to be brought into the

                        business by the additional owners, along with the sharing of business risk and return.
                        Partnerships are often formed and governed by a written partnership agreement that
                        outlines specific partner roles and responsibilities and the sharing of profits, losses,
                        and obligations. However, a written agreement is not required; partnerships can be
                        formed verbally or incidentally through actions.



                           Exhibit 3: General Partnership

                                                                         General
                                                                       Partnership



                                                          Unlimited                   Shared control of
                                                           liability                 business operations




                                                Partner                  Partner              Partner




                        Examples of general partnerships include service businesses, such as builders or
                        contractors, and joint ventures of multiple businesses. Such businesses have a small
                        number of partners who usually contribute equal or similar amounts of capital. The
                        partners bring complementary expertise, such as expertise in business development,
                        financial acumen, operations, or legal/compliance, and they share responsibility in
                        running the business. All profits, losses, and risks of the business are collectively
                        assumed and shared by the partners. If one partner is unable to pay his share of the
                        business’s debts, the remaining partners are fully liable. As with a sole proprietorship,
                        potential for growth is limited by the partners’ ability to source financing and expertise
                        and their collective risk tolerance because the partners are still personally liable for
                        business losses and debt.
                            Exhibit 4 shows a type of partnership called a limited partnership, which addresses
                        some of the shortcomings of general partnerships. In a limited partnership, there must
                        be at least one general partner (GP) with unlimited liability that often manages the
                        business. Remaining partners, however, called limited partners (LPs), have limited
                        liability, meaning their losses are limited to the size of their investment in the limited
                        partnership, and may not have any management responsibilities. With limited liability,
                        personal assets are considered separate and thus protected from the obligations of the
                        business. All partners are entitled to a share of the profits and losses as specified in
                        the partnership agreement, with GPs typically receiving a larger portion in exchange
                        for their greater risk and personal liability. Partnership agreements are customized
                        and negotiated by the partners and can be highly complex, with multiple partnership
                        tiers that have varying profit and loss sharing arrangements.

In a limited partnership, while financial risk and reward are shared, such resources
as capital and expertise are typically limited to what the partners can contribute, and
limited partners usually grant managerial responsibilities to the GP, which entails risk.
Partnership agreements are customized and often limit the transferability of ownership
interest or expansion beyond a small group of partners. Like sole proprietorships,
partnerships are typically pass-through businesses for tax purposes. Pass-through
businesses are not taxed at the entity level, passing on all their profits or losses to
the partners who are taxed personally. Business income from these entities is passed
through and taxed regardless of whether income was actually distributed or retained
in the partnership and reinvested.
    In some jurisdictions, there is a special form of limited partnership known as a
limited liability partnership (LLP), which does not require a general partner and is
instead composed entirely of limited partners, thus resolving the risk of unlimited
liability for the GP. Instead, all partners have limited liability, and the partners share in
management responsibilities, typically appointing one or more partners as managing
partners. In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, LLPs are permitted only
for professional services firms, such as law, accounting, engineering, and architecture,
and have limits on the number of partners and legal restrictions on equity investment.


Limited Companies
Finally, a limited company has many similarities to limited partnerships but includes
several more features that allow greater access to financing and expertise for growth.
In many jurisdictions, there are two types of limited companies: private limited com-
panies and public limited companies.
    The private limited company is similar to a limited partnership. But the form
includes limited liability for all owners, improved transferability of ownership inter-
ests by dividing ownership into units called shares that are more easily tradeable,
and a distinction between owners and managers. Owners, known as shareholders
or members, elect a board of directors to manage the company and authorize any
distributions of profits to owners. Boards of directors typically appoint professional
managers. Private limited companies are known by many names in different juris-
dictions, including limited liability company (LLC) and S corporation in the United
States, G.K. in Japan, SARL in France, GmbH in Germany, and company with limited
liability in China.

                         In many jurisdictions, including the United States, private limited companies have
                         legal limits on the number of owners and require votes for transferring ownership
                         interest but are pass-through businesses (like LPs), meaning that taxes on business
                         income are paid only at the shareholder, not company, level.
                             Finally, public limited companies, often called corporations, are similar to private
                         limited companies but in most jurisdictions face no legal restrictions on the number
                         of owners or ownership transferability, while still featuring limited liability and sep-
                         aration of ownership and management. For these reasons, public limited companies
                         are the most suitable form for companies that seek to go public and are the dominant
                         organizational form globally by revenues and asset values. However, public limited
                         companies are disadvantaged in most jurisdictions compared to the other organiza-
                         tional forms in one respect: taxation. While other forms are taxed only on business
                         income and loss at the owner (personal) level, public limited companies are taxed at
                         the business level and again at the personal level if profits are distributed to share-
                         holders. But if profits are retained and reinvested in the company, the shareholder
                         level of tax does not apply, which makes this organizational form more suitable for
                         companies intending to retain profits to fund investment.
                             Public limited companies are known by different names in different jurisdictions,
                         including C-corporation in the United States, corporation in China, Société anonyme
                         in France, AG in Germany, and K.K. or stock company in Japan. Examples are numer-
                         ous, including most if not all well-known multinational companies.

       The retail real estate assets are wholly owned by Simon Property Group
   L.P., a limited partnership. Its partners include Simon Property Group Inc., the
   general partner, and approximately 200 limited partners. The general partner
   has full managerial responsibilities and unlimited liability and has an ownership
   interest of 87% in the partnership.
       Importantly, the general partner, Simon Property Group Inc., is itself a
   corporation. It is broadly owned by thousands of shareholders, including the
   founding family, which owns 8% of shares. Simon Property Group Inc. has a
   single asset: its partnership interest in Simon Property L.P.
       Simon’s structure allows co-investing with limited partners, full management
   control, and receiving most of the income from the assets, while benefiting
   from broad access to financing, because while the GP has unlimited liability, its
   shareholders have limited liability. Partnerships composed of entities with limited
   liability, such as corporations, are common because they shield the ultimate
   owners (in this case, shareholders of Simon Property Group Inc.) from business
   risk but allow for the sharing of profit and loss in the underlying business.

   The key distinctions between sole proprietorships, partnerships, and public limited
companies or corporations are outlined in Exhibit 6.

                                   How Are Investment Funds Organized?
                                   Investment funds are pools of capital contributed by one or more investors for
                                   earning returns and managing risks. Investment funds are like other companies
                                   in a market economy: They hire professional management to invest capital,
                                   sometimes with additional borrowed money, in various assets to achieve return
                                   objectives subject to risk constraints. Major differences between funds and other
                                   companies include employing few people directly, primarily investing in financial
                                   instruments rather than operating assets, diversification of assets, and having
                                   specific rather than general objectives (e.g., exceed a benchmark rate of return).
                                       Two common organizational forms for investment funds are corporations
                                   and limited partnerships, as illustrated in the following two diagrams. When
                                   organized as a corporation, fund investors hold shares that represent their
                                   proportionate interests in the pool of underlying assets. When organized as a
                                   limited partnership, fund investors hold partnership units that either represent
                                   their proportionate interests in the pool of underlying assets or varying interests
                                   of specific assets.

  wholly owned private limited company entity that serves as the GP to protect
  the fund manager from unlimited liability.


QUESTION SET


  1. Identify two features that distinguish a general partnership from a
     limited partnership.
     Solution:
     Owner–manager relationship: The management of a general partnership is
     typically shared by the general partners, while in a limited partnership, the
     general partner often exercises most managerial responsibilities.
     Owner liability of business debts and obligations: In a general partnership,
     the partners are personally legally liable for business debt and actions un-
     dertaken by the company. In a limited partnership, only the general partner
     faces personal liability; limited partners’ liability is limited to their invest-
     ment in the partnership.

                                                                     ​




                             Business Attribute                          Organizational Form

                             A. Significant capital needs                1. Limited liability partnership
                             B. Single owner, desires simplicity         2. Corporation
                             C. Company provides professional            3. Sole proprietorship

                                                                     ​




                               Solution:
                               A. 2. Corporation
                               B. 3. Sole proprietorship
                               C. 1. Limited liability partnership
                               A company with significant capital needs will want broad access to fi-
                               nancing. In such a case, the corporate organizational form likely is most
                               appropriate.
                               For the single owner who desires simplicity, a sole proprietorship is a
                               suitable mechanism. In some jurisdictions, it is the “default” organizational
                               form and does not require registration.
                               Professional service companies, such as a law firm, require the owners to
                               have the skill sets to manage the company. A partnership structure is suit-
                               able, and a limited liability partnership structure allows for the partners to
                               share managerial control without any partner assuming unlimited liability.

                            3. If a company owner expects to have a significant need for financing, which
                               of the following organizational forms is the least appropriate choice?
                                A. Corporate
                                B. Partnership
                                C. Sole proprietorship
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. A sole proprietorship is limited in financing to the owner’s
                               funds and by the amount the owner can borrow personally. A partnership
                               expands access to financing by adding owners, spreading risk, and adding
                               borrowing capacity. The corporate form provides for the broadest access to
                               financing because there are no limits to the number of shareholders and,
                               with limited liability, shareholders are relatively more comfortable with the
                               company borrowing.

                            4. Fill in the blanks in the following sentence:

                               ________________ liability is a benefit to the corporate organizational form,
                               but the form does face a possible disadvantage because of ________________
                               taxation of distributed business income.
                               Solution:
                               Limited liability is a benefit to the corporate organizational form, but the
                               form does face a possible disadvantage because of double taxation of distrib-

  5. True or False: Partnerships are typically taxed at the entity level rather than
     at the individual partner level.
       A. True
        B. False
       Solution:
       B is correct. Partnerships are typically pass-through entities, meaning that
       business income earned by the partnership is passed through to the partners
       according to the terms of partnership agreement, and each partner is taxed
       at the personal level.




KEY FEATURES OF CORPORATE ISSUERS
                                                                                          3
              describe key features of corporate issuers

The prior lesson addressed several advantages of the corporate organizational form
over others, such as limited owner liability, owner–manager separation, and improved
access to external financing. In this lesson, we explore the features of corporations
in greater depth. Corporations that raise capital in the financial markets, known as
corporate issuers, are essential for financial analysts to understand, because they
raise more capital from investors than even governments worldwide.


Legal Identity
A corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its owners formed through
the filing of articles of incorporation with a regulatory authority. Corporations share
many of the rights and responsibilities of an individual and may engage in similar
activities. For example, a corporation can enter into contracts, hire employees, sue
and be sued, borrow and lend money, make investments, and pay taxes.
    Large corporations frequently have business operations in many different geographic
regions and are subject to each regulatory jurisdiction where
   ■    the company is incorporated,
   ■    the business is conducted, and
   ■    the company finances itself
   and for such activities as
   ■    registration,
   ■    financial and non-financial reporting and disclosure, and
   ■    capital market activities (issuance, trading, investment).



Owner–Manager Separation
A key feature of most corporations is the separation between those who own the
business (the shareholders) and those who operate it, as represented by the board of
directors and management. In a corporation, shareholders are largely removed from the
                         © CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.

                         day-to-day operations of the business. Instead, shareholders elect a board of directors
                         that, in turn, appoints executive-level management, such as the chief executive officer,
                         who is accountable for investing, financing, and operating decisions. Directors and
                         managers have a primary responsibility to act in the best interest of shareholders and,
                         indirectly, all stakeholders. The separation of ownership and management enables the
                         corporation to obtain financing from a larger universe of potential investors who do
                         not need (or want) to be involved in management.
                             If a board or management does not act in shareholders’ best interests, shareholders
                         can enact change through exercising voting rights attached to their shares—for exam-
                         ple, by voting to replace the board of directors—though this can take time. Influencing
                         operations or changing management outright using engagement and voting rights is
                         a strategy pursued by some investors and will be discussed in detail in later lessons.


                         Owner/Shareholder Liability
                         Risk is shared among all shareholders, who face limited liability. That is, the maxi-
                         mum amount shareholders can lose is what they have invested in the company (i.e.,
                         the value of their shares can fall to zero but no further), and they are not responsible
                         for the debts of the corporation unless they separately, specifically guarantee them.
                             Shareholders share in the risk and return of the company in proportion to their
                         share ownership unless the corporate charter specifies differently. Unlike partnerships,
                         ownership units are divided into shares of smaller unit size, allowing investors to more
                         easily purchase or sell ownership interests as represented by their shares. For example,
                         some issuers have more than 1 billion shares outstanding, meaning that ownership
                         interests are divided into extremely small increments. Additionally, some corporations
                         issue multiple types or classes of shares with different risk and return characteristics,
                         which will be discussed in a later lesson. Exhibit 7 shows the relationship between
                         owners and the corporation.

                         External Financing
                         The separation between ownership and management allows corporations to access
                         external financing more easily than other business structures because purchasing a
                         share is the only requirement to become an owner. While more expensive to form and

exceed what could be raised by an individual or small group of partners. Financing
may be provided by individuals or by institutions, such as mutual funds, pension
funds, banks, governments, non-profits, and other corporations.
    Corporations are financed in two ways: with equity, by selling shares to investors
or reinvesting profits, and with borrowings, or debt, in the form of loans, bonds,
and leases. Equity investors (shareholders) have a right to receive any distributions
of profits, known as dividends, while debt must be repaid on a pre-specified date
in the future with interest. Equity or debt financing can be raised based on a private
contractual agreement between an issuer and investors or in the form of a security, a
standardized instrument that might be tradeable among investors on a public exchange,
which will be covered in the next lesson.
    Exhibit 8 shows the relationship between debt and equity on a corporation’s balance
sheet and how these are related to its assets.

While the “financial” balance sheet at the top of Exhibit 8 shows an issuer’s assets
(left-hand side) and its sources of financing (right-hand side) from short term to
long term measured in financial terms, other intangible or hard-to-quantify assets
or liabilities of a firm, such as the human capital associated with its employees and
supplier and customer relationships, are included on what may be referred to as an
issuer’s broader “economic” balance sheet.
     Similarly, Exhibit 9 shows an issuer’s income statement and distinguishes between
its financial income or net income once fixed obligations have been met and its “eco-
nomic” profit, or return to a firm’s owners in excess of what they could have earned
elsewhere on different investments, known as their required rate of return on equity.

                         Taxation
                         While taxation for corporations can differ greatly from country to country, the cor-
                         poration is ultimately subject to the tax authority and tax code governing the issuer’s
                         tax reporting, payment, and status. In most countries, corporations are taxed on
                         their profits. Taxable profits are usually not the same as profits reported on financial
                         statements, because tax codes and accounting standards differ.
                             In many countries, shareholders pay an additional tax on distributions (dividends)
                         that are passed on to them. This is referred to as the double taxation of corporate
                         profits. In some countries, shareholders do not pay a personal tax on dividends if the
                         corporation has paid tax previously on the earnings distributed to shareholders or
                         shareholders receive a personal tax credit for their proportional share of taxes paid
                         by the corporation. In other countries, corporations pay no tax at all or may face
                         different tax regimes within one country.

EXAMPLE 3

   Double Taxation of Corporate Profits

   1. The French retail giant Auchan Holding generated pre-tax income of €838
      million last year and paid corporate taxes of €264 million. Investors in
      France also pay a 30% tax on dividends received. If Auchan had fully dis-
      tributed its after-tax income to investors as a dividend and all its investors
      are in France, what is the total tax rate as a percentage of Auchan’s pre-tax
      income?
      Solution:
                                             ​




    Pre-Tax Income                               €838
    Corporate Taxes (31.5%)                      €264
    After-Tax Income                             €838 – €264
                                                 = €574
    Distributed Dividend                         €574
    Investor Dividend Tax (30%)                  €574 × 0.30
                                                 = €172.2
    Total Tax Rate                               (€264 + €172.2)/€838
                                                 = 52.1%
                                             ​




      If the after-tax income of €574 million were paid to investors as a dividend,
      investors would pay €172.2 million in personal taxes on the dividends
      received. Total taxes paid would be €436.2 million (€264 million at the cor-
      porate level plus €172.2 million at the personal level), resulting in a total tax
      rate of 52.1%.



    Despite the tax disadvantage illustrated in the prior example, the corporate form
remains attractive for several reasons. While corporate shareholders are taxed on
distributions, sole proprietors and partners are often taxed on all profits regardless of
whether they are distributed as dividends (exceptions exist with allowances for profit
reserves). This difference makes the corporate structure attractive to businesses that
expect to reinvest undistributed profits in, for example, additional capacity for growth.
Also, in jurisdictions where corporate tax rates are lower than personal income tax
rates, it can be advantageous to “store” profits in the business.

QUESTION SET


   1. Explain why the separation of ownership from management allows
      for corporate issuers to have greater access to capital.
      Solution:
      By separating ownership from management responsibilities, corporations
      can attract a broad range of owners, especially individuals and institutions,
      who do not want to be involved in management but would like to participate
      as investors.

                            2. Fill in the blanks in the following sentence:

                               Limited liability of shareholders refers to the fact that the ________________
                               amount shareholders may lose on their investment is the ________________
                               paid to buy the shares.
                               Solution:
                               Limited liability of shareholders refers to the fact that the maximum amount
                               shareholders may lose on their investment is the price paid to buy the
                               shares.

                            3. In which of the following situations does the double taxation of the corpo-
                               rate organizational form matter the least?
                                A. The company expects to pay all its after-tax income as a dividend to
                                   shareholders each year.
                                B. The company’s shareholders reside in a tax jurisdiction with a high tax
                                   rate on dividend income.
                                C. The company is expecting to reinvest all its after-tax profits each year
                                   into growth of the business.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Reinvestment of all profits implies that the company pays no
                               dividend to shareholders, and thus, no double taxation occurs.
                               A is incorrect. Double taxation occurs because dividend income is taxed at
                               both the corporate level and the shareholders’ personal levels. If all af-
                               ter-tax profits are distributed, shareholders are taxed twice on the business’s
                               income.
                               B is incorrect because a high tax rate on shareholders’ dividend income
                               received would be a strong impetus to retain profits, find alternative means
                               of distributing profits, or change the organizational form.

                            4. Referring to the Auchan Holding example in this lesson, calculate the
                               amount of the tax disadvantage (in euros) Auchan has in its corporate
                               form compared to if it were organized as a limited partnership. Recall
                               that Auchan’s pre-tax profit was €838 million, the corporate tax rate was
                               31.5%, the personal income tax rate was 30%, and all after-tax profits were
                               distributed.
                               Solution:
                               If Auchan were organized as a limited partnership, its pre-tax profit would
                               be passed through to the owner(s) and taxes would only be paid at the per-
                               sonal level. Thus, total taxes paid would be €251.4 million (= €838 million
                               × 0.30), or €184.8 million lower than total taxes paid under the corporate
                               organizational form, and this tax of €251.4 million would be paid regardless
                               of whether the partnership distributed the profit to partners.

                            5. Corporate issuers are characterized by all of the following except:
                                A. Corporate income is taxed at both the corporate and personal levels.
                                B. Owners do not need to be involved in management of the company.
                                C. The owners of the corporation are not legally distinct from the
                                   corporation.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. A corporation is a legally separate entity from its owners.

Publicly vs. Privately Owned Corporate Issuers                                                   21


        A is incorrect because corporate income is taxed at both the corporate and
        personal levels unless the company pays zero dividends.
        B is incorrect because shareholders are not required to exercise manage-
        ment control over the company. While in some cases, a large shareholder
        may serve as senior management or be on the board of directors, most
        shareholders do not take on management responsibilities.

               compare publicly and privately owned corporate issuers

For corporations, “public” and “private” (or “listed” and “unlisted”) are often defined
by whether the company’s shares are listed and tradeable on an exchange. Somewhat
confusingly, this is different from the discussion of private and public limited companies
in an earlier lesson; most public or listed companies are public limited companies, but
public limited companies are not obliged to list their shares on an exchange.

An exchange, which for equities is referred to as a stock exchange, is a rules-based,
open access market venue where financial instruments are traded, with price and
volume transparency accessible by issuers, investors, and their intermediaries. In
addition to an exchange listing, primary features distinguishing public and private

                             A public (listed) company has some or all of its shares listed and traded on an
                         exchange. These shares may be widely held or involve a majority or controlling owner.
                         Shareholders may include individuals, employees, institutions on behalf of individuals
                         (e.g., pension funds), other corporations, governments, and non-profits. The shares that
                         are traded actively—and thus are not held by insiders, strategic investors, or sponsors
                         but are more freely available on exchanges—are known as an issuer’s free float. Free
                         float is often expressed as a percentage of total shares outstanding.

                            L’Oréal S.A., the world’s largest beauty company, is a French société anonyme,
                            or public limited company. It has been public since listing its shares on the Paris
                            Stock Market (now Euronext) in 1963. As of 31 December 2021, L’Oréal had
                            approximately 535 million shares outstanding.
                                L’Oréal’s shares are mostly owned by Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, her
                            family, and Nestlé (a large, listed Swiss consumer goods company), and the
                            remainder—the free float, approximately 44% of shares—is owned by institutional
                            investors, individual investors, and L’Oréal employees.

                         Exchange Listing, Liquidity, and Price Transparency
                         An exchange listing allows ownership to be more easily transferred because inves-
                         tors transact directly with one another in the secondary market on the exchange. An
                         investor can become a shareholder in a public company by executing a buy order in
                         a brokerage account or reduce an ownership position by executing a sell order. This
                         can be done immediately for a relatively small number of shares in a liquid stock
                         or take longer for many shares in a company whose shares trade infrequently. An
                         exchange listing provides share price transparency, allowing investors to track how
                         a company’s value changes.

                                                         Parties trade with one another
                                                            in the secondary market




In contrast, the shares of a private company are not listed (do not trade on an
exchange), so no visible company valuation or share price transparency exists. This
makes ownership transfer between investors far more difficult than for a public com-
pany. A private company shareholder seeking to sell shares must find a willing buyer,
and the two parties must negotiate a price. Even then, the company may refuse the
transfer of ownership. Private company shareholders must exercise patience. Their
investment is usually locked up until the company is acquired for cash or shares by
another company or it goes public.
    Private companies do, however, provide benefits that may outweigh the downside of
limited transferability of shares. Private companies typically have fewer shareholders,
meaning that controlling owners and management are accountable to fewer stake-
holders. Second, many early-stage companies are private. If successful, an investor in
their equity could earn high returns. Finally, private companies have few disclosure
requirements, which are costly to comply with, and there are few regulations and
costs associated with raising financing in private transactions. While some claim
that private status results in improved performance from greater focus on the long
term, as opposed to focusing on quarterly earnings and other short-term measures
associated with listed companies, the empirical evidence for short-termism among
listed companies is thin at best.1


Share Issuance
Corporate issuers may issue additional equity shares in the capital markets from time
to time. For a public issuer, these shares can be traded in the secondary market once
they’re issued. In contrast, private companies finance smaller amounts in the primary
market (private debt or equity) from fewer investors who typically have longer holding
periods. Exhibit 12 and Exhibit 13 illustrate differences in public and private company
share issuance and relative size of financing.

                         Private company investors are typically invited to purchase shares in the company
                         through a private placement whose terms are outlined in a legal document (public
                         companies can also conduct private placements, subject to regulatory constraints).
                         Private company investors may be limited to qualified or so-called accredited inves-
                         tors or sophisticated investors, or those deemed to be able and willing by regulatory
                         authorities to assume the greater risk of a non-public offering.


                         Registration and Disclosure Requirements
                         Perhaps the defining attribute of public companies is transparency and disclosure.
                         Public companies must register with a regulatory authority and are subject to com-
                         pliance and reporting requirements. For example, companies with securities listed on
                         US exchanges (e.g., NYSE and NASDAQ) must file audited financial statements and
                         other information on a quarterly basis with the Securities and Exchange Commission
                         (SEC), which are then accessible to the public on the SEC’s EDGAR (Electronic
                         Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system or on the company’s website. In the
                         European Union, financial statements must be reported in the EU’s standardized ESEF
                         (European Single Electronic Format) in the registry of domicile, at least semiannually.
                         Public companies’ annual reports regularly exceed 100 pages.
                             Besides qualitative information and financial reports, public companies must also
                         disclose major changes in the holding of voting rights and other information that may
                         affect security prices, such as management and director stock transactions. Significant
                         share purchases and sales by management may contain information for investors, such
                         as management’s confidence in exceeding expectations or leading to questions about
                         a company’s business strategy.

Publicly vs. Privately Owned Corporate Issuers                                              25


    Private companies are generally not subject to the same level of regulatory dis-
closures, although many rules pertain to both private and public companies (such
as prohibitions against fraud and the obligation to file corporate tax returns). While
not required, some private firms disclose pertinent information directly to owners
as well as lenders, especially if they hope to be able to raise additional financing in
the future. Exhibit 14 and Exhibit 15 compare typical entity relationships for public
and private companies.

                               ther exchange listed nor usually subject to registration requirements. Share
                               issuance is less widely distributed, creating a greater chance of ownership
                               overlap between management and shareholders. Private company shares are
                               illiquid. Generally, these companies are required to make only non-financial
                               disclosures. The sale of their equity and debt is privately negotiated between
                               company insiders and capital providers.

                            The Story of Tesla
                            In 1997, engineer Martin Eberhard and computer scientist Marc Tarpenning
                            started a company called NuvoMedia to make an electronic book reader called
                            the Rocket eBook, a precursor to Amazon’s Kindle. Three years after it was
                            founded, NuvoMedia was sold for $187 million.
                                 Soon after, the two entrepreneurs formed a new company focused on mak-
                            ing electric sports cars. They named the company Tesla Motors in honor of the
                            inventor Nikola Tesla, forming a corporation in 2003. As a high-risk, capital-in-
                            tensive endeavor, they used some of their new-found wealth and sought other
                            cofounders with expertise in electric vehicles and fundraising capabilities. Elon
                            Musk, an entrepreneur with a shared vision in the commercialization of electric
                            sports cars, joined the team, as did Ian Wright and J. B. Straubel, the company’s
                            chief technical officer.
                                 In addition to investing $6.3 million in Tesla in 2004, making him the largest
                            shareholder, Musk helped raise money from venture capitalists. Musk became
                            CEO in 2008, the year Tesla released its first vehicle, the Roadster. In 2010, Musk
                            led Tesla’s initial public offering, which raised $226 million. Over the next several
                            years, Tesla shifted from sports cars to passenger vehicles, greatly expanding its
                            vehicle production and product line, and in 2016, it also entered the photovoltaics
                            market. In 2017, it changed its name from Tesla Motors to Tesla, Inc., to reflect
                            its diversification into energy storage. The company continued global expansion

   of automobile production, issuing several billion dollars in three secondary equity
   offerings in 2020. Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas and
   reached a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2021.
       The evolution of Tesla, Inc., over less than 20 years of existence from a startup
   to a firm among those with the largest market capitalization globally was assisted
   by the flexibility of its organizational form as a corporation. Tesla was able to
   obtain significant financing from both debt and equity investors and retain key
   employees, including Musk, with equity-based compensation.

    Private companies may become public companies (“go public”) in three ways: IPO,
direct listing, or acquisition.

                                                                Company

Tesla Motors became a public company using an initial public offering (IPO). To
complete an IPO, companies must meet specific exchange listing requirements and
usually engage financial intermediaries known as investment banks to underwrite the
sale of new shares. Proceeds from the sale of new shares go to the issuing corporation,
and its shares begin trading on an exchange.
    Private companies can also go public through a far less common method known
as a direct listing, which differs from an IPO in two important ways. A direct listing
does not involve an underwriter and no new shares are issued, so no capital is raised.
Instead, the company simply lists existing shares on an exchange at a price determined
by the market, and shares become available to the public as they are sold by existing
shareholders. Although direct listings, compared with IPOs, may take place more
quickly and at a lower cost, they are usually undertaken only by larger, more established
companies with a recognized brand, as in the following example.

EXAMPLE 6

   In early 2018, Sweden-based music streaming company Spotify Technology SA
   became the first foreign issuer to go public via direct listing on the New York
   Stock Exchange (NYSE). Founded in 2006, Spotify secured multiple rounds of
   venture capital equity financing and also raised debt prior to going public. Unlike
   other private companies seeking to go public, Spotify was a well-known brand
   and an established company, having entered the US market in 2011, with over

                            70 million global subscribers and over $5 billion in revenue during the prior
                            year. When announcing its direct listing, Spotify said it chose this financing
                            route because it could list without diluting existing shareholders, offer liquidity
                            to existing shareholders, and provide equal access to buyers and sellers.

                             Alternatively, a private company may become public via an acquisition. This may
                         occur indirectly if the company is acquired by another that is already public. In such
                         cases, the acquiring company is usually larger, so an investor in the combined entity
                         has minimal exposure to the private company that was acquired.
                             Another means of going public via acquisition is through a special purpose
                         acquisition company (SPAC), which is a transaction like the reverse merger that
                         was popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. A SPAC is a shell company, often called a
                         “blank check” company, that exists solely for the purpose of acquiring an unspecified
                         private company sometime in the future. SPACs raise capital and go public through
                         an IPO. Proceeds are placed in a trust account and can be disbursed only to complete
                         an acquisition; otherwise, they must be returned to investors. SPACs are publicly
                         listed, often specialize in a particular industry, and have a finite time period, such as
                         18 months, to acquire a private company before proceeds are returned to investors.
                         While investors in a SPAC may not know which private company the SPAC will buy,
                         they may have expectations based on the SPAC executives involved or comments
                         these individuals have made in the media.
                             Once the SPAC completes the purchase of a private company, that company
                         becomes public. SPACs are replacing the formerly used reverse merger process of
                         going public, which typically used a dormant listed company with a previous business
                         and trading history.

   2. True or false: Accredited investors are the capital providers qualified by
      regulators to invest in public companies. Justify your answer.
      Solution:
      The statement is false. Accredited investors are judged by regulators to have
      the sophistication for understanding and assuming the risks that come with
      investing in private, not public, companies.




Going from Public to Private
Public companies may also decide to go private. A “take-private” or “go-private” process
involves investors acquiring all of the company’s publicly traded shares and delisting
the company from the exchange. The investors must typically pay a premium above
the current share price and often use debt to finance the acquisition. Go-private trans-
actions are initiated by investors who believe that actions could be taken that would
result in a higher valuation than that reflected in the current share price. Going private
puts these investors in control and takes the company out of public view, which may
be beneficial. These actions undertaken with greater private control might include
management changes, selling assets, restructuring, or realizing cost savings that are
expected to exceed the premium paid and financing costs. Once these actions are
complete, investors may take the company public again several years later if they are
able to achieve the desired valuation at that time.
    Public versus private company trends can provide insight into market developments.
For example, many emerging economies have a growing number of public companies,
while the opposite is occurring in developed economies. Emerging economies are
usually characterized by higher rates of growth, a transition to more open market
structures, and foreign capital inflows. This is consistent with a growing number of
listed companies on an emerging economy’s domestic stock exchange.
    A declining number of listed public companies in developed markets is a result
of several factors. One cause is a higher number of mergers and acquisitions, which
reduces the number of independent listed companies. Another is the growing number
of private capital sources available, such as venture capital and private equity, allowing
companies to access needed capital while avoiding the additional cost, regulatory bur-
den, public scrutiny, and compliance costs associated with a public listing. Another
factor is that many private companies simply choose to remain private because it
preserves control by incumbent owners and management.


The Varieties of Corporate Owners
Corporations offer a great deal of flexibility in ownership and objectives. As discussed
earlier, shareholders include not only individual and institutional investors but also
other corporations, governments, and non-profits, which may be controlling owners.
    Governments sometimes create legally separate corporations while maintaining
100% or varying levels of ownership. For example, a sovereign government may
establish a wholly owned corporation but create a board of directors and management
structure, along with compliance and reporting requirements, such as the issuance
of audited financial statements. This structure provides increased transparency to
taxpayers and external investors (limited to debt investors in this case) as to whether
the corporation achieves its objectives and generates a profit or a loss, which must be
financed from the government’s budget. This structure is used by the United States

                         Postal Service (USPS), while postal services in some countries, such as the Netherlands
                         (KPN), the United Kingdom (Royal Mail), and Germany (Deutsche Post), are partly
                         or fully investor owned.
                             Government-owned corporations exist in both developed and emerging economies,
                         in some cases to supply public goods, such as infrastructure, which creates positive
                         externalities, and in others to earn profits in a major domestic industry. For example,
                         government-owned corporations are common in developed economies among postal
                         systems, railways, and other infrastructure, such as airports. In emerging economies,
                         state-owned or state-controlled enterprises often operate in a dominant domestic
                         industry, such as basic commodities or energy. Financial intermediaries, such as
                         banks, are also often first established as government institutions in these markets.
                         As the economy seeks foreign and domestic capital from the private sector to expand
                         and diversify, government companies are often gradually transferred to private sector
                         ownership via an IPO, as in the following example.

                          EXAMPLE 7

                            Saudi Aramco IPO
                            Nearly 50 years after oil was first discovered in Saudi Arabia, the government
                            issued a decree creating the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) to take
                            control of and carry out petroleum and natural gas production in the country.
                            To partially finance a plan to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce reliance
                            on oil, the Saudi government announced its intention in 2016 to raise up to $100
                            billion on global exchanges by selling a 5% stake in the company, valuing Saudi
                            Aramco at $2 trillion. Given IPO delays and a lower, $1.7 trillion valuation, in
                            2019, the Saudi government opted to scale down its plans, selling a 1.5% stake on
                            the domestic Saudi stock exchange for $25.6 billion instead. Despite the smaller
                            size, this transaction was the largest IPO to date and created the world’s most
                            valuable publicly traded corporation at the time.

                             In other instances, industry deregulation and/or technological change is the catalyst
                         for a shift from government to private sector ownership. For example, the telecom-
                         munications industry shifted from government-owned monopolies across developed
                         and less developed economies in the 1980s to many private sector corporations and
                         varying degrees of government ownership today. This expanded access to capital has
                         greatly enhanced the industry’s ability to invest in rapidly evolving cellular technology.
                         In the area of power generation, a similar shift from government to private sector has
                         occurred, leading to greater diversification of energy production, as well as recently
                         leading to investment in sustainable and renewable sources of energy, as in the case
                         of Public Power Corporation S.A.

                          EXAMPLE 8

                            power generation monopoly. In response to the European Electricity Directive
                            separating power generation, transmission, and distribution, the company issued
                            an IPO in 2001 for 34% of its shares and reduced government ownership further,
                            to 51%, through subsequent share raises over the next few years. The company

     agement control of the company. Is this corporate issuer more likely public
     or private?
      A. Public
      B. Private
     Solution:
     B is correct. The lack of need for new equity capital implies less reason to
     have exchange-listed stock, as does the ability to operate the business with
     the current debt capacity available under its existing credit facility. The
     majority owner exercising management control could possibly imply either
     public or private status, although combined with the first two attributes, it is
     doubtful that such a company would be public.

  2. Which of the following does not reflect a primary difference between an
     initial public offering (IPO) and a direct listing?
      A. Whether or not employees own shares in the private company
      B. Whether or not new capital is raised
      C. Whether or not an underwriter is used
     Solution:
     A is correct. A company with employee shareholders can go public with
     either an IPO or a direct listing; employee shareownership does not differ by
     the choice of transaction.
     C is incorrect. An IPO uses an underwriter to manage the process and un-
     derwrite the purchase of new shares, while a direct listing does not.

                               B is incorrect. An IPO raises new capital for the listing company by issuing
                               new shares to the public, while a direct listing does not; it lists only existing
                               shares.

                            3. Describe two benefits of being a public company and two reasons that an
                               issuer may instead prefer to be private company.
                               Solution:
                               Benefits of public status:

                                ■   Public listing allows the company to access capital from a broader
                                    range of investors, thus making larger capital raises more feasible.
                                ■   Public listing allows for price transparency for investors and ease
                                    of trading because of stock exchange listing. This may be especially
                                    beneficial if employees own significant stock, because listing creates a
                                    market for these shares.
                               Benefits of private status:

                                ■   Fewer disclosure requirements, thus reducing compliance costs and
                                    perhaps conferring competitive advantages because information can
                                    be kept private.
                                ■   Fewer stakeholders, thus allowing for improved access to communica-
                                    tion channels.



                            4. Identify a major reason why a national government would be a 100%
                               shareholder in a corporate issuer, and discuss two factors that may cause a
                               national government to reduce its ownership in a state-owned company.
                               Solution:
                               A national government may choose to be the 100% owner of a company
                               that provides public goods to the national economy, such as infrastructure
                               and public safety, that would either not be provided by private means or
                               be delivered inequitably or inefficiently. In some cases, a country may have
                               natural resources, such as crude oil, and the national government may use a
                               wholly owned corporation for production and to invest profits in ways that
                               benefit its country.
                               Two possible reasons that a country may reduce its ownership in a state-
                               owned company include (1) opportunities to bring in foreign capital and
                               diversify the country’s economy, such as the case highlighted by the Sau-
                               di Aramco example, and (2) a push for privatization and deregulation to
                               potentially lower costs through competition and motivate innovation, as
                               highlighted by the postal services examples.

                            5. A public company acquires a private company. Is the acquired company
                               public or private after the acquisition? Explain the rationale for your choice.
                                A. Public
                                B. Private
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Even though the acquired company will not have its own
                               shares, the shareholders of the acquirer own the formerly private company,
                               though the percentage of assets of the combined company attributable to

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                         The following information relates to questions
                         1-5
                             Dee’s Arbor Group Inc. (DAG Inc.) is a large international investor in timber and
                             forest assets located on the North and South American continents. DAG Inc. is
                             the general partner of DAG LP, a limited partnership that is the 100% owner of
                             the timber and forest assets. DAG LP is controlled by DAG Inc. and its limited
                             partners; the limited partners own a 20% stake in the partnership, while DAG
                             Inc. holds the remaining majority stake.
                             DAG Inc.’s shares are listed on stock exchanges in the United States and Canada.
                             DAG Inc. is organized as a special corporate form available in its jurisdiction in
                             which it does not pay corporate income taxes so long as it distributes all of its
                             net income as dividends to its shareholders and complies with other conditions.
                             In the current and past fiscal years, DAG Inc. has complied with all of these
                             conditions.
                             DAG Inc.’s shares are owned by various members of the Dee family, who hold
                             several key senior management positions at DAG Inc. and DAG LP, and collec-
                             tively they own 30% of the shares of DAG Inc. The remainder of DAG Inc.’s shares
                             are owned by a variety of individual and institutional investors, none of whom
                             own more than 5%. The following diagram shows the organizational structure of
                             DAG Inc. and DAG LP.

                                                                  Forest Assets

                         1. What percentage of the timber and forest assets are effectively owned by the Dee
                            family members in this scenario?
                             A. 24%

                             B. 30%

                             C. 80%

                         2. Which of the following best describes the taxation of DAG Inc. and DAG LP?
                             A. DAG LP pays tax based on its pre-tax income.

   B. Shareholders of DAG Inc. pay tax based on dividend income.

   C. DAG Inc. pays tax based on its pre-tax income.

3. Which of the following best describes DAG LP and DAG Inc.?
   A. Neither DAG LP nor DAG Inc. is managed by a majority owner.

   B. DAG Inc. has limits to its ability to raise new capital because of the dividend
      requirement on its corporate form.

   C. DAG Inc. faces unlimited liability as the general partner, while DAG Inc.’s
      status as a corporation implies that its shareholders face limited liability.

4. What is a significant difference between the limited partners of DAG LP and the
   outside shareholders of DAG Inc.?
   A. Managerial responsibilities

   B. Taxation of income from the partnership

   C. The ability to vote and replace members of the DAG Inc. board of directors

5. Which of the following rationales would be most consistent with the Dee family’s
   choice to create this complex organizational structure instead of simply organiz-
   ing as a limited partnership?
   A. It provides management control without the need for majority ownership by
      the family, while maintaining limited liability.

   B. The complex structure eliminates the potential for double taxation.

   C. The complex structure avoids potential problems associated with outside
      investors exercising voting rights.

                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. A is correct. The Dee family effectively owns 24% of the timber and forest assets.
                            They own 30% of the shares of DAG (the publicly traded corporation), and they
                            own 80% of the limited partnership (which owns the assets): 24% = 30% × 80%.

                         2. B is correct. DAG Inc. is organized as a special corporate form available in its ju-
                            risdiction in which it does not pay corporate income taxes. DAG LP, as a limited
                            partnership, is a pass-through entity. DAG Inc. shareholders pay tax on dividend
                            income.
                            A is incorrect. DAG LP is a limited partnership. Partnership income is passed
                            through to each partner, and the partners pay tax at the personal level.
                            C is incorrect. DAG Inc. is organized as a special corporate form available in its
                            jurisdiction in which it does not pay corporate income taxes.

                         3. C is correct. DAG Inc. is the general partner of DAG LP and thus has unlimited
                            liability in the partnership. However, as a corporation, DAG Inc.’s shareholders
                            have limited liability for its losses and obligations.
                            A is incorrect. DAG LP is 80% owned by DAG Inc., the general partner that
                            manages the partnership. DAG Inc. is 30% owned by the Dee family, who holds
                            several key managerial positions.
                            B is incorrect. As a public company, DAG Inc. can raise new equity by issuing
                            shares on an exchange. The dividend requirement is not a binding limit on its
                            ability to raise capital but, rather, might be an attractive feature to prospective
                            investors.

                         4. C is correct. The limited partners of DAG LP are not shareholders of DAG Inc.,
                            so they do not have voting rights in the corporation. Additionally, because the
                            limited partners own only 20% of the partnership, they also have little ability to
                            remove DAG Inc. as the general partner. In contrast, outside shareholders own
                            70% of DAG Inc. and have voting rights. They could use their collective owner-
                            ship to effect change in the management of DAG Inc.
                            A is incorrect. Neither the DAG LP limited partners nor the outside shareholders
                            of DAG Inc. have managerial responsibilities. The general partner has managerial
                            responsibilities of the partnership, and the board of DAG Inc. has managerial
                            responsibilities of the corporation.
                            B is incorrect. Owing to the special corporate form of DAG Inc., both the corpo-
                            ration and the limited partnership are pass-through entities. Therefore, neither
                            the partnership nor the corporation pays entity-level income taxes, but both the
                            limited partners and shareholders are responsible for personal income taxes.

                         5. A is correct. The Dee family can effectively control management of the timber
                            and forest assets with only a 24% effective ownership stake in the partnership. If
                            the family had opted for a limited partnership as the organizational form, they
                            likely would need a much higher ownership stake to assert management control
                            and would have unlimited personal liability.
                            B is incorrect. The double taxation problem is not an issue in the more complex
                            structure, nor is it a problem in the partnership structure, because both are
                            pass-throughs.
                            C is incorrect. The complex structure potentially creates problems because of the
                            existence of outside shareholders constituting a majority of votes.

INTRODUCTION
Corporate issuers are financed with debt and equity. Debt and equity securities have
                                                                                          1
different risk and return profiles for both issuers and investors. This learning module
discusses these differences and their implications, while also considering the per-
spectives of a broader group of stakeholders beyond debtholders and shareholders.
We introduce these groups and discuss potential conflicts of interest among them.
Balancing stakeholder interests is important, as both issuers and investors have
increasingly incorporated environmental, social, and governance factors into their
decision-making processes. Analysts assess ESG factors to better evaluate issuers’
expected future performance and risk profile.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Corporate issuers are financed with debt and equity. Debt is a
          financing source with a finite length, and interest and principal
          payments are promised on pre-specified future dates. Debtholders
          have a priority claim over shareholders to an issuer’s cash flows and
          assets.
      ■   Equity is a source of permanent financing, and no promises of repay-
          ments or distributions to shareholders are made. Equity is a residual
          claim on an issuer’s cash flows and assets.
      ■   From the perspective of an issuer, debt is riskier than equity. From the
          perspective of an investor, equity is riskier than debt. The proportion
          of debt in a firm’s capital structure affects both the potential return
          and the risk of cash flows.

                                ■   Conflicts of interest may exist between debtholders and sharehold-
                                    ers. Debtholders’ payoff is limited to promised interest and principal
                                    payments, while shareholders’ payoff is theoretically unlimited as

                            These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                            of understanding of this learning module.
                               Complete each statement by selecting the most appropriate term in
                            parentheses.

                            1. ____________ make permanent capital available to issuers. (debtholders,
                               shareholders)
                               Solution:
                               Shareholders make permanent capital available to issuers.
                               Debtholders is incorrect. Debt has a finite maturity, though it can be far in
                               the future.

                            2. ____________ have a residual claim against a firm’s cash flows. (debtholders,
                               shareholders)
                               Solution:
                               Shareholders have a residual claim against a firm’s cash flows.
                               Debtholders is incorrect. Debtholders have a priority claim over sharehold-
                               ers to a firm’s cash flows and assets.

                            3. The shareholder theory of corporate governance is _______________ than
                               the stakeholder theory. (narrower, broader)
                               Solution:
                               The shareholder theory of corporate governance is narrower than the stake-
                               holder theory.
                               Stakeholders are groups and individuals with a vested interest in a firm’s
                               success and include, but are not limited to, shareholders.

                            4. ESG considerations are an explicit objective in the _____________ theory of
                               corporate governance. (shareholder, stakeholder)
                               Solution:
                               ESG considerations are an explicit objective in the stakeholder theory of
                               corporate governance.
                               The stakeholder theory seeks to balance the interests of shareholders with
                               the interests of a broader group that relate to ESG considerations.

  5. The estimated impact of ESG factors on corporate issuers’ financial and
     share price performance has _________________ over time. (decreased,
     remained the same, increased)
     Solution:
     The estimated impact of ESG factors on corporate issuers’ financial and
     share price performance has increased over time. This impact is the result
     of changing consumer and investor preferences, increased regulations and
     taxes related to ESG factors, and the rising threat of climate change.

  6. ESG factors are increasingly recognized as _______________ by analysts.
     (quantifiable, qualitative)
     Solution:
     ESG factors are increasingly recognized as quantifiable by analysts. His-
     torically, ESG factors were considered negative externalities with no direct
     effect on firms’ financial statements. Increasingly, analysts are quantifying
     the effects of ESG factors and including them in firm valuation and invest-
     ment decision-making.

Debt Versus Equity
The prior module established that corporations finance their assets with debt and
equity. We now turn our attention to the nature of these claims, their relative risk
versus return for both issuers and investors, and potential conflicts of interest that
may arise between lenders and shareholders.

Debt and Equity Claims
Exhibit 1 shows the relationship between a corporation’s assets and the claims of its
debt and equity investors that finance them. Exhibit 2 shows that assets are used to
generate income to pay interest to debtholders, while remaining profits are either
reinvested or distributed to shareholders.

                         Debtholders, or lenders, provide capital with a finite maturity. Issuers agree to make
                         promised interest payments and to repay principal on pre-specified dates. Lenders
                         have no decision-making power within the corporation, but debt contracts can be
                         structured to protect lenders by imposing financial requirements and/or legal claims
                         on certain assets of the corporation if the debt is not repaid as agreed. As shown in
                         Exhibit 2, interest payments are paid before any distributions to equity investors and
                         are a priority claim against a company’s assets and cash flows.

Financial Claims of Lenders and Shareholders                                                     41


    Equity investors make permanent capital available to issuers; issuers generally do
not commit to future dividends or repayments to shareholders. Rather, equity is a
residual claim against company cash flows—whatever is left after expenses, invest-
ments, and debt payments. Cash distributions to equity investors are at the discretion
of the board of directors. In contrast to lenders, equity investors have voting rights on
important company matters such as choosing the board of directors, which appoints
and oversees management.
    In addition to interest payments to debtholders, other claims that must be satisfied
before any shareholder distributions are made include payments to suppliers, employ-
ees, and governments (in the form of taxes). If a firm is dissolved and its assets are
liquidated, these priority claims must be met before equity investors receive anything.
    Because debt is a priority, fixed, and finite claim on assets and cash flows, it is a less
costly form of financing for issuers: it is lower risk for investors than equity (though,
as will be discussed, increasing debt increases risk for a company’s equity investors).
Another difference between debt and equity is that debtholder interest payments are
usually treated as a tax-deductible expense, reducing taxable income, while dividends
paid to shareholders are not.

      Whether offered in the form of a loan or a bond, debt involves a contractual
      obligation with priority interest and principal claims. Equity investors re-
      ceive discretionary distributions and have a residual claim to assets. Equity
      dividend payments are not tax deductible. Debt requires contractual interest
      and principal payments, with interest expense being tax deductible for the
      issuer. Debt has a finite term and confers no decision-making power, while
      equity has an unlimited term and includes voting rights.

                         Debt Versus Equity: Risk and Return
                         As established earlier, debtholder claims are fixed and finite, while equity owners have
                         ongoing claims to a firm’s current and future profits. While firms usually start with
                         equity financing, those with more predictable cash flows may choose to borrow rather
                         than sell additional ownership stakes to finance assets. The trade-offs between debt
                         and equity financing for both issuers and investors are best shown by the following
                         example.

                               Assume that both firms have revenue, over a period, of 100 and operating
                            expenses of 70. Ignore income taxes.

                            1. If we assume interest expense of 15 for the period, calculate net income for
                               each firm and compare their returns on equity (ROE) for the period. Explain
                               why ROE is higher when debt financing is used.
                               Solution:
                               Solve for net income by subtracting expenses from revenue, and divide net
                               income by total equity to solve for the one-period return on equity:

                               Return on equity is higher when debt is used, because the interest cost of
                               debt is lower than the firm’s return on assets. Interest rate on debt = 15/75 =
                               20% versus return on assets = 30/100 = 30%.

                            2. Calculate returns on equity for the period if the firms experience a 20% in-
                               crease and a 20% decrease in revenue (from Question 1), assuming expenses
                               remain unchanged.
                               Solution:
                               Solve for net income and return on equity given the increase and decrease

      This example demonstrates the greater potential shareholder return when
      debt financing is used—but also the greater risk. In particular, the net loss
      in the downside case for the issuer financed with debt and equity raises the
      possibility that it may be unable to meet future debt payments. The variation
      in ROE for the company financed with debt and equity is significantly higher
      than the ROE variation for the all-equity-financed company.

     From an issuer’s perspective, debt financing is less costly but involves greater risks
than equity financing, because it commits the issuer not only to interest and prin-
cipal payments but also to any restrictions that lenders impose in the debt contract.
The greater use of debt for a given amount of equity financing, known as financial
leverage, increases the likelihood that the firm may be unable to meet its promised
obligations to lenders, resulting in bankruptcy and potential liquidation. The firm
faces no such risk in the case of equity financing, as shareholders are not promised
any distributions or repayments.
     From an investor’s perspective, stocks are riskier than bonds because shareholders
hold residual rather than fixed claims against the firm. As shown in Example 1, the
profits available for distribution to shareholders can vary greatly, depending on the
performance of the firm as well as financial leverage. If a corporation is successful, there
is theoretically no limit to how much equity owners could earn on their investment.
But if the firm performs poorly, owners can lose their entire investment if the firm
is liquidated and debtholders take control of the assets. Due to their limited liability,
however, shareholders cannot lose more than their initial investment.

                             While debt financing adds risk, equity holders often prefer it to an issuer raising
                         additional equity to fund growth, because additional share issuance reduces the frac-
                         tional firm ownership of existing shareholders, known as dilution. The downside of
                         dilution may be offset by an expectation that the firm will generate enough incremental
                         profit to compensate.

                            is 100, expenses are 70 and are expected to remain unchanged, interest on new

                               Financing the investment by issuing shares produces the lowest ROE due
                               to the dilution from additional equity. Because the investment produces a
                               return equal to the beginning ROE, there is no change in ROE. Financing
                               with debt produces a higher ROE, because the interest rate on debt is lower
                               than the return on the new investment and no new shares are issued, so eq-
                               uity does not increase. The highest ROE is produced by using cash on hand,
                               which avoids both the increase in equity and the interest cost of new debt.

                                      Debt




If the firm is solvent—that is, its value (V) exceeds the value of its debt (D)—then
the value to shareholders is the positive difference between the firm’s value and the
value of its debt. Potential upside gains to shareholders are limited only by the future
value of the firm. If a firm becomes insolvent, with a debt value greater than that of
its assets (V < D), shareholders lose their entire investment and debtholders take
control of the firm.
    Exhibit 4 shows this asymmetry from the perspective of debtholders.

Lender returns are limited to promised interest and principal payments so long as the
firm is solvent, regardless of firm performance and financial leverage. In contrast, if
firm value falls below that of debt, the firm is declared insolvent and debtholders seek
to recover their capital from remaining firm assets. Note that if we add the shaded
areas for the shareholder payoff and the debtholder payoff, we get the diagonal line
showing the total value of the firm as debtholders are owed promised payments and
equity holders get the residual.

                            While equity owners seek to maximize firm value (to increase their payoff ),
                         bondholders seek to ensure the timely repayment of principal and interest, with the
                         company maximizing its ability to meet its debt obligations. These perspectives are
                         summarized in Exhibit 5.

                            1. Corporate equity and debt holders share the same investor perspec-
                               tive with respect to:
                                 A. maximum loss.
                                 B. investment risk.
                                  C. return potential.
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. For both equity and debt holders, their initial investment rep-
                                 resents their maximum possible loss. The return potential is theoretically
                                 unlimited for equity holders, while it is capped for debtholders. Equity hold-
                                 ers are exposed to a higher level of investment risk, as they hold a residual
                                 claim on the firm’s cash flows that is lower in priority to the debtholders’
                                 claim.

                            2. True or False: Debtholders, unlike equity holders, have symmetric potential
                               downside losses and upside gains.
                                 A. True.
                                  B. False.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct; the statement is false. Both debtholders and equity holders have
                                 asymmetric potential payoffs. For debtholders, potential upside gains are
                                 limited to interest and principal repayments, regardless of how high the val-
                                 ue of the firm rises. In contrast, if the value of the firm falls below the value
                                 of its debt, debtholders can lose up to their initial investment.
                                 For equity holders, equity value is determined as the value of the firm less
                                 the value of its debt. Potential upside gains to shareholders are limited only
                                 by the future value of the firm, while shareholder losses, like those of deb-
                                 tholders, are limited to their initial investment.

Financial Claims of Lenders and Shareholders                                              47



Conflicts of Interest among Lenders and Shareholders
While both lenders and owners are compensated from the same firm cash flows, the
differing risk and return profiles of debtholders and shareholders create potential
conflicts of interest.
    Shareholders seek to maximize residual cash flows, or firm profits, once other
obligations are met. Since these investors lose their entire investment in the case of
insolvency but have unlimited upside return potential, they prefer that management
pursue projects with greater calculated risks and higher potential returns while max-
imizing the use of debt financing. Additionally, shareholders can demand higher cash
dividends, which can increase leverage, thereby increasing risk for debt investors.
Example 1 illustrated the greater potential equity return associated with the use of
leverage.
    Bondholders seek to maximize the likelihood that they will receive timely interest
and principal payments; they derive no benefit from greater leverage used to pursue
projects with higher risks given limited upside. As a result, bondholders generally
prefer that management invest in less risky projects that increase cash flow certainty.
Since they have no voting rights over management decisions, bondholders seek to
impose contractual restrictions such as requiring cash flow coverage for debt pay-
ments and/or limiting a firm’s financial leverage. These restrictions prevent a firm
from taking actions that may benefit shareholders but reduce the firm’s likelihood of
debt repayment in the future.

QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following groups has a residual claim on an issuer’s
     cash flows?
      A. Employees
      B. Debtholders
      C. Shareholders
     Solution:
     C is correct. Shareholders are residual claimants to a firm’s cash flows and
     receive discretionary distributions after priority claims (e.g., employee com-
     pensation, supplier payments, interest expenses, and taxes) are met.

  2. Which is more sensitive to changes in firm value: debt or equity? Explain
     your answer.
     Solution:
     Equity is more sensitive to changes in firm value, because debtholders have
     fixed, priority claims while equity holders have residual claims whose value
     is contingent on future firm profits. On the one hand, if firm value increases,
     residual value accrues to shareholders while debtholder payments do not
     change. On the other hand, reductions in firm value fall first on equity hold-
     ers. If firm value falls below debt value and the firm is declared insolvent,
     equity holders typically receive nothing and debtholders take control of the
     firm and often seek to liquidate its assets.

  3. Interest payments to debtholders are:
      A. residual payments.
      B. at the discretion of the board.

                                  C. deductible for corporate income tax purposes.
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. Interest payments on debt are tax deductible for the firm.
                                 A is incorrect. Debtholders have priority claims on the cash flows of the firm
                                 over shareholders.
                                 B is incorrect. Interest payments are contractual, not discretionary like
                                 shareholder dividends.

                            4. All of the following are characteristics of debt except:
                                 A. limited liability.
                                 B. unlimited return.
                                  C. priority in payment.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. Shareholders, not debtholders, have the potential for unlimited
                                 return.
                                 A is incorrect. Debtholders and shareholders both have limited liability.
                                 C is incorrect. Debtholders have a priority claim over shareholders to a
                                 firm’s cash flows.

                            5. All else being equal, a jurisdiction increasing its corporate income tax rate
                               would most likely lead to ____________________ (lower/higher/the same)
                               use of debt financing by issuers.
                                 Solution:
                                 Higher. An increase in the corporate income tax rate would likely result in
                                 a higher mix of debt. Interest payments on debt are tax deductible, so an
                                 increase in the tax rate would reduce the after-tax cost of debt financing, all
                                 else being equal, thus making debt financing relatively more attractive than
                                 equity financing.

                         among debtholders and shareholders. Corporations operate in a complex ecosystem
                         where the interested parties are a much broader group than shareholders alone. These
                         parties depend on the company—and the company depends on them—for economic
                         success, though their short- and long-term goals may be in conflict. A corporation’s
                         ability to maximize shareholder return and meet debt and other obligations may be
                         either compromised or enhanced by the actions of these parties, known as stake-
                         holders. A stakeholder is any individual or group with a vested interest in a company.
                         Financial analysts must understand and incorporate these groups and their actions
                         into their assessment of a firm’s expected performance and risk profile.

Shareholders versus Stakeholders
In a typical corporation, shareholders elect the board of directors, which hires man-
agers to serve the interests of shareholders. The interests of other parties—such as
creditors, employees, customers, and even society—are considered only to the extent
that they affect shareholder value. This concept is referred to as the shareholder
theory of corporate governance.
    In contrast, the stakeholder theory of corporate governance suggests that
corporate governance should consider all stakeholder interests, not just those of
shareholders. For example, it is often suggested that environmental, social, and gov-
ernance (ESG) considerations be an explicit objective of the board of directors and
management. This approach gives rise to several challenges, including:
   ■   complexity of balancing multiple objectives;
   ■   defining, measuring, and balancing non-shareholder objectives;

                          GOVERNANCE

                            The shareholder and stakeholder theories of corporate governance are not
                            necessarily at odds with each other. In a famous 1970 essay espousing the share-
                            holder theory, “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits,”
                            economist Milton Friedman noted as much, particularly if management is taking
                            a long-term perspective:

                                  “It may well be in the long‐run interest of a corporation that is a major
                                  employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities
                                  to that community or to improving its government. That may make it easier
                                  to attract desirable employees, it may reduce the wage bill or lessen losses
                                  from pilferage and sabotage or have other worthwhile effects. Or it may
                                  be that, given the laws about the [tax] deductibility of corporate charitable
                                  contributions, the stockholders can contribute more to charities they favor
                                  by having the corporation make the gift than by doing it themselves, since
                                  they can in that way contribute an amount that would otherwise have been
                                  paid as corporate taxes.”1

                         Investors
                         The prior lesson distinguished between shareholders’ residual claims to corporate cash
                         flows and debtholders’ finite, fixed claims, which are senior to those of shareholders.
                             Shares typically entitle their owners to certain rights, including the exclusive
                         right to vote on such important matters as the composition of the board of directors,
                         mergers, and the liquidation of assets. While all debtholders usually establish issuer
                         requirements and lender rights at the inception of a debt contract, private debtholders
                         and public debtholders (bondholders) differ in several ways.
                             Private debtholders, such as banks and other institutions that offer loans, credit
                         facilities, and leases, often hold a debt investment to maturity. They typically have
                         direct access to company management and non-public information, which lowers
                         information asymmetry. Since an individual bank or private lender can be a critical
                         source of financing, particularly for a small or mid-sized company, they may have
                         great influence over the company. The relaxation of debt restrictions and extension
                         of further credit—or refusal to do so—by a single private lender can be far more
                         impactful for companies with limited access to capital markets than for those with
                         broad debt market access.
                             Private lenders may also have a wider variation in their risk appetite, approach,
                         behavior, and relationships with borrowers. For example, a commercial real estate lessor
                         may primarily care about receiving lease payments, the upkeep of the real estate, and
                         whether it can renew or re-lease the asset at attractive rates. In other cases, a lender

may hold both debt and equity in a company or take a more equity-like approach to
evaluating the business. Finally, some private lenders specialize in lending to businesses
as they either approach, or are in, bankruptcy.
     Bondholders, which are often institutional investors and asset managers, rely on
public information such as financial statements to make investment decisions. These
investors usually have little to no influence over an issuer’s operations, relying instead
on the terms of the debt contract negotiated at inception. While it is relatively more
difficult to gain the consent of bondholders versus private lenders to change the terms
of an existing agreement, bondholders can sometimes exercise significant influence if
a firm in financial distress must restructure outstanding public debt.


Board of Directors
A company’s board of directors is elected by shareholders to advance shareholders’
interests. The board is responsible for hiring the CEO and monitoring company and
management performance. Boards often include both inside directors (including
founders and current and former managers) and independent directors (no material
relationship with the company, including employment, family ties, and so on), who
may better represent the interests of minority shareholders. Major stock exchanges
maintain corporate governance standards with which listed companies must comply,
and these standards often include director independence requirements. For example,
the London Stock Exchange requires at least half of the directors of listed companies
to be independent, and the Singapore Exchange listing rules state that “there should
be a strong and independent element on the board” with a majority of non-executive
directors. Besides independence, corporate governance standards also typically require
boards to include a diversity of backgrounds, expertise, and competencies. Director
duties are mandated by laws that vary by jurisdiction, but directors are usually required
to display a high standard of prudence, care, and loyalty to the company.
    While the single-tier board structure is prevalent in the USA and the UK, a two-tier
corporate governance structure is common in Continental Europe and is legally
mandated in some countries (e.g., Germany). Under the two-tier model, a separate
supervisory board is elected to oversee the activities of the board of directors. The
supervisory board consists solely of independent directors from among corporate
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, labor unions, the public at large, and,
in some cases, government representatives for firms with state ownership. While the
board of directors remains responsible for strategy and management oversight in the
two-tier system, the supervisory board may appoint or dismiss board members and
must approve selected board decisions, among other duties.
    Although most boards hold simultaneous elections for specific terms (e.g., all
board members elected annually or bi-annually), some companies have staggered
boards, with directors divided into groups elected separately in consecutive years.
It takes several years to replace a full staggered board, which limits the ability of
shareholders to effect a major change of control at the company. However, staggered
board elections allow for continuity without constant reassessment of strategy and
oversight by new board members, which may introduce short-termism into company
strategy. Staggered boards are common in Australia and several European countries.


Managers
Led by the chief executive officer (CEO), managers are responsible for determining
and implementing the strategy of the corporation, under the oversight of the board
of directors, as well as day-to-day operations. Senior executives and other high-level
managers are usually compensated via a base salary in cash and an annual bonus that

                         often involves cash and stock, as well as a multi-year, stock-based incentive plan and
                         other benefits. In addition to preventing manager attrition, compensation structures are
                         designed to align manager interests with those of shareholders and other stakeholders.


                         Employees
                         A corporation relies on the labor and skills, or human capital, of its employees
                         to provide its goods and services. In return, employees typically seek competitive
                         compensation and benefits, development opportunities, job security, and a safe and
                         healthy work environment. In some industries and/or countries, workers join labor
                         unions to collectively negotiate compensation, benefits, working conditions, and
                         other matters with management. Employees may have an equity investment in their
                         employer through equity-based participation plans (such as profit sharing, share
                         purchases, or stock options) beyond their financial interests as employees. For most
                         employees, equity ownership is a minor component of total compensation but can
                         be significant in some cases.


                         Customers
                         Customers expect a company’s products or services to satisfy their needs at a rea-
                         sonable price while meeting applicable quality and safety standards. Depending on
                         the product or service and their relationship with the company, customers may seek
                         ongoing support, product guarantees, and after-sale service. While major corporate
                         customers may exercise significant influence over a company, the loyalty and satisfac-
                         tion of retail customers are also often correlated with revenue and profit growth. The
                         environmental or social impact of products is of growing importance to customers.
                         For example, brand boycotts and shareholder actions in response to negative envi-
                         ronmental and social effects, as well as product-related controversies, may adversely
                         affect sales and profits.


                         Suppliers
                         A company’s suppliers include suppliers of raw materials and intermediate goods
                         as well as software and outsourced services like call centers and payroll. Suppliers
                         are often also short-term creditors with a primary interest in being paid in a timely
                         manner for products or services delivered.
                             When a company is in financial distress, the financial position of its suppliers may
                         be affected as well as their willingness to extend additional credit to the company.
                         However, suppliers also have long-term interests in companies, as they seek to build
                         and maintain mutually beneficial relationships. Supplier interest in a company’s
                         long-term stability is important when products are specialized and one or both parties
                         have invested in the relationship through product design, training, or customization.


                         Governments
                         Governments seek to advance the interests of their constituencies and ensure the
                         well-being of the economies over which they preside. Because corporations have a
                         significant effect on economic output, capital flows, employment, social welfare, and
                         the environment, among other factors, regulators have an interest in ensuring that
                         corporations comply with applicable laws. Moreover, corporations and their employees
                         are a major source of tax revenue.

  Source: Volkswagen AG 2021 Annual Report
  Volkswagen AG (VW) was fully government owned from 1937 until it issued
  public shares in 1960. The German state of Lower Saxony, where VW is the
  largest private employer, retained a 20% share of voting rights. A German law
  (the “Volkswagen law”) was enacted when VW went public, requiring over 80%
  of votes for major matters to pass, effectively giving the state veto power.
      German auto rival Porsche AG (wholly owned by the Porsche family) sought
  to take over Volkswagen in 2007. Instead, the two companies merged in an equity
  deal that left the Porsche family as VW’s largest shareholder.
      While the Porsche family’s majority voting rights give it power over the
  board of directors, the supervisory board is equally divided between labor and
  shareholder representatives. Given its 20% voting stake and the Volkswagen
  law, the government of Lower Saxony partners with labor representatives to
  promote the retention of local employees by vetoing domestic plant closures,
  cost reductions, and other measures that adversely affect union employees.


KNOWLEDGE CHECK


  1. Which stakeholders would most likely realize the greatest benefit
     from a significant increase in the market value of the company?
      A. Creditors
      B. Customers
      C. Shareholders
     Solution:
     C is correct. Shareholders have residual claims on the company, and their
     wealth is directly related to the market value of the company. A is incor-
     rect because creditors are usually not entitled to any additional cash flows
     (beyond interest and debt repayment) if the company’s value increases. B is
     incorrect because, though customers may have an interest in the company’s
     stability and long-term viability, they do not benefit directly from a higher
     company value.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Briefly discuss how the shareholder and stakeholder theories of
                               corporate governance may in fact be aligned with each other.
                               Solution:
                               The stakeholder theory considers balancing the objectives of shareholders,
                               debtholders, and the broader set of stakeholders that have a vested interest
                               in the success of the firm. It may be in the shareholders’ best interests in the
                               long run to make decisions within this broader framework. For example,
                               high wages and good working conditions can lead to productive employees
                               and low employee turnover, which boosts profits.

                            2. Applying the stakeholder theory of corporate governance requires:
                                A. balancing multiple objectives only.
                                B. measuring non-shareholder objectives only.
                                C. both balancing multiple objectives and measuring non-shareholder
                                   objectives.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. To implement the stakeholder theory of corporate governance,
                               it is necessary to both measure non-shareholder objectives and balance the
                               objectives of shareholders and non-shareholders.

                            3. Identify and explain a method of aligning the interests of shareholders, man-
                               agers, and employees.
                               Solution:
                               Aligning manager and employee interests with those of shareholders can be
                               accomplished with performance- and/or share-based compensation. Share-
                               holders seek an increase in profits and firm value, and performance-based
                               compensation—such as bonuses based on profit or shareholder return mea-
                               sures, or profit sharing with employees—would align manager and employee
                               interests with shareholder interests. Awarding shares or stock options to
                               employees and managers increases alignment, as employees and managers
                               become shareholders themselves.

                            4. Compared with public debtholders (e.g., bondholders), private debtholders
                               (e.g., banks, lessors):
                                A. have less influence over company management.
                                B. have access to non-public information about the company.
                                C. are less likely to consent to changes in the debt contract.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Private debtholders, including banks and other direct lenders,
                               typically have direct access to management and non-public information,
                               which lowers information asymmetry.
                               A is incorrect. Private debtholders typically have more influence over com-
                               pany management than bondholders do.
                               C is incorrect. Private debtholders have closer and more bespoke relation-
                               ships with borrowers than bondholders do and thus are more likely to allow
                               changes in the debt contract, such as changing covenants.

    5. Which of the following board structures would most limit shareholders’
       ability to effect a major change in the management of a firm?
        A. Majority inside, staggered
        B. Majority independent, staggered
        C. Majority independent, non-staggered
       Solution:
       A is correct. A board with a majority of inside directors could more easily
       resist outside change than one with a majority of directors who were inde-
       pendent of management. Also, a staggered board would allow only a portion
       of the directors to be voted out each year, so it would take several years to
       replace a majority of directors.

shareholder perspective by prioritizing environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
factors in making investment decisions. Corporate issuers include these factors when

                         investment decision-making has evolved more slowly. While many environmental and
                         social issues exist, identifying which of these factors are most likely to affect company
                         performance, and how and when they will do so, is often less clear.
                            ESG considerations are of increasing importance for three reasons:
                             1. The material financial impact of ESG factors on corporate issuers has risen.
                                Both shareholders and debtholders have suffered substantial losses due to
                                environmental disasters, social controversies, and governance deficiencies.
                             2. Interest in the environmental and social impacts of investments has grown,
                                particularly among younger clients, who increasingly demand that newly
                                acquired or inherited wealth, as well as pension contributions, be managed
                                with ESG considerations in mind.
                             3. As government stakeholders continue to prioritize climate change and social
                                policies, revised regulations are forcing corporate issuers to adapt their busi-
                                ness practices to meet more stringent ESG criteria.
                             Environmental and social issues, such as climate change, air pollution, and societal
                         impacts of company products and services, have historically been treated as negative
                         externalities, or costs not borne by the company and its investors. But increased
                         stakeholder awareness and stronger regulations are forcing companies to internalize
                         environmental and societal costs in their income statements, either explicitly or
                         implicitly, for responsible investors.
                             While ESG factors were once regarded as intangible or qualitative information,
                         improved identification and analysis, as well as enhanced corporate disclosures, have
                         resulted in increasingly quantifiable information.

                          KNOWLEDGE CHECK


                            1. ESG considerations are increasingly relevant for which of the fol-
                               lowing reasons (select up to three options)?
                                A. Many in the new generation of investors are demanding that invest-
                                   ment strategies incorporate ESG factors.
                                B. ESG issues are having more material impacts on companies’
                                   valuations.
                                C. Environmental and social issues are being treated as negative
                                   externalities.
                               Solution: A and B are correct.
                               A is correct. A growing number among the new generation of investors
                               increasingly demand that their inherited wealth or pension contributions be
                               managed using investment strategies that systematically consider material
                               ESG risks, as well as negative environmental and societal impacts, of their
                               portfolio investments.
                               B is correct. ESG issues are having more material impacts on companies’
                               valuations. Many investors have suffered substantial losses due to corporate
                               mismanagement of ESG issues, resulting in environmental disasters, social
                               controversies, and governance deficiencies.
                               C is incorrect. Environmental and social issues are less frequently treated as
                               negative externalities than in the past. Increased stakeholder awareness and
                               stronger regulations are forcing companies to internalize environmental and
                               societal costs in their income statements, either explicitly or implicitly, for
                               responsible investors.

Environmental Factors
The materiality of environmental factors can vary significantly across industries. An
ESG factor is material when that factor is believed to have a significant impact on a
company’s results or business model. For firms in natural-resource-intensive indus-
tries, environmental factors often have a direct material effect on operations, while in
other cases the impact may be material but indirect in nature. Environmental factors
generally considered material by investors include climate change, pollution and waste,
resource and land use, ecological footprint, and biodiversity.
     Climate change considerations are often framed as either physical risks or transi-
tion risks. Physical risks include damage to or destruction of assets by severe weather,
which is expected to significantly increase in frequency as the climate changes. Physical
risks can often be insured against or diversified. Transition risks are losses related to
the transition to a lower-carbon economy, which may result from regulations or shifting
consumer demand. For example, a coal producer’s revenues may decline materially
if its electric utility customers switch to lower-emission fuel sources and renewables.
A specific instance of transition risk for energy companies and their investors is
stranded assets, or emission-intensive reserve assets at risk of becoming unviable,
thereby reducing their value (e.g., even if an oil well were to produce oil from 2029
to 2059, production might have to cease early due to regulations or uneconomical
prices). Analysts may find it difficult to assess this risk for energy companies, given
uncertainties of regulations and break-even prices.
     Adverse material environmental effects can arise from decisions based on inade-
quate governance or errors in judgment. For example, oil spills, industrial waste con-
tamination, and local resource depletion can result from poor environmental standards,
breaches of safety standards, or unsustainable business models. Such events can be
costly in terms of regulatory fines, litigation, clean-up expenses, and reputational risk.

EMISSIONS AND WASTE AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

   Environmental issues such as emissions and waste have historically been treated
   as externalities and have thus not been fully addressed in companies’ financial
   reporting. However, with growing awareness among stakeholders, including
   regulators, companies may face financial liabilities for pollution, contamination,
   and the emission of toxic or carcinogenic substances and therefore must manage
   these risks. Gross mismanagement of these risks may result in a company not
   only incurring severe financial penalties but also losing permanently its license
   to operate.
       In 2019, the collapse of Dam I of the Córrego do Feijão Mine in Brumadinho,
   Brazil, resulted in the spillage of millions of tons of mud; 270 lives were lost,
   and the nearby Paraopeba River was contaminated. The mine was owned and
   operated by Vale, a multi-national Brazilian mining corporation. Vale has since
   been accused of hiding information about the dam’s instability for years to avoid
   damaging its reputation. Several company employees, including its ex-CEO, and
   its auditor, TÜV SÜD, were charged with murder and environmental crimes.
   Vale was fined millions of dollars by the Brazilian government and reached an
   agreement in 2021 to repair all environmental damage and pay USD7 billion to
   the families of victims killed in the disaster.

                         Social Factors
                         Social factors typically pertain to a firm’s practices concerning, and their impacts on,
                         its employees and human capital, customers, and communities in which it operates.
                         Compensation, turnover, worker health, training and safety, employee morale, employee
                         diversity, customer data privacy, and community relations can all affect a company’s
                         ability to sustain its performance over the long run. Minimizing social risk can lower
                         a company’s costs through higher employee productivity, lower employee turnover,
                         reduced litigation potential, and reduced reputational risk.

                          DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY AS A SOCIAL RISK

                            Data privacy and security addresses how companies gather, use, and secure per-
                            sonally identifiable information and other meta-data collected from individuals.
                            In some industries, such as internet software and services, this issue includes
                            managing the risks associated with government requests that may result in
                            violations of consumers’ civil and political rights.
                                As more services are offered online, consumers often unknowingly leave a
                            large digital footprint using such services. Some information may be personally
                            identifiable in nature, leaving users vulnerable to theft or misuse of data. As
                            reported in the 2019 Cost of a Data Breach Report released by IBM and Ponemon
                            Institute, the average cost of a data breach is USD3.9 million.
                                Mismanagement of data and privacy and security breaches can have materially
                            significant consequences for both a company’s business model and its financial
                            performance. For example, lax cybersecurity measures at Equifax, a US-based
                            consumer credit reporting agency, led to a data breach and the theft of identity
                            and financial data of over 140 million US citizens in 2017. Equifax has incurred
                            hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses arising from the breach and has
                            faced numerous lawsuits and investigations.
                                In a separate case, Facebook, a leading US-based social media platform,
                            shared the personal data of over 80 million users with a third-party consultancy
                            without users’ consent. The consultancy gathered psychological profiles of users
                            and accessed their contacts to influence voters in US elections, leading to one
                            of the largest US government fines (USD5 billion) imposed in the technology
                            sector to date—and to a significant decline in user trust. Facebook’s subsequent
                            renaming as Meta Platforms in late 2021 was considered by some analysts a
                            means of distancing itself from the corporation’s privacy and other social issues.



                         Governance Factors
                         As outlined in an earlier lesson, corporate governance and stakeholder management
                         address issues that include:
                             ■   company ownership and voting structure;
                             ■   relevance of board skills and experience to current and future company
                                 needs;
                             ■   alignment of management compensation with company results;
                             ■   strength of company shareholder rights versus peers; and
                             ■   company effectiveness in managing long-term risks and sustainability.

    Analyses of these areas and questions—typically found in issuers’ proxy statements,
annual reports, and sustainability reports—can provide important insights about the
quality of management and sources of risk. Corporate governance will be discussed
in greater depth in the next learning module.

SIEMENS AG BRIBERY SCANDAL AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CHANGES

  In 2006, German police raided the headquarters of Siemens AG, the largest
  industrial manufacturing firm in Europe, as officials uncovered one of the largest
  corporate corruption cases in history. German and US investigators subsequently
  discovered that the payment of bribes to foreign government officials by Siemens
  employees to secure sales and contracts was standard operating procedure for
  decades, with total bribery payments exceeding EUR1 billion (dating back to
  2001). While hundreds of Siemens employees were dismissed and the firm faced
  over EUR3 billion in fines, the disgorgement of profits, and other costs, the failure
  of leadership led to substantial upheaval at the board and senior management
  level as well as the establishment of new governance policies.
      Both the supervisory board and the managing board chairmen resigned,
  and for the first time in its 160-year history, Siemens hired a CEO from outside
  the company and most senior managers were dismissed. As the prior boards
  were found to lack sufficient understanding of, or engagement with, the busi-
  ness, both the new supervisory board and the new managing board included
  members with insight into operational activities and active decision-making.
  The new managing board was composed of the CEO, CFO, head of HR, and
  representatives from key operational units as well as the areas of supply chain
  management and sustainability, legal, and compliance. The firm increased its
  scrutiny and oversight of many regional businesses, whose prior autonomy had
  resulted in significant violations. Finally, to rebuild trust with internal and external
  stakeholders, Siemens instituted a firmwide anti-corruption policy designed to
  prevent, detect, and respond to compliance breaches.



Evaluating ESG-Related Risks and Opportunities
Recall from an earlier lesson that debt and equity investors have different claims
to the same cash flows of a corporation. The process of identifying and evaluating
ESG-related factors that affect these cash flows is therefore similar for both equity
and corporate credit analyses.
    The question of how and when ESG factors affect corporate cash flows rests on
differences in their effect on the value of debt and equity claims.
   ■   Once identified, the material effects of ESG factors must first be quantified
       in financial terms—that is, how are the firm’s discounted future cash flows
       positively or negatively affected by these factors?
   ■   In the case of significant long-term adverse ESG-related events, equity
       claims are usually immediately and disproportionately affected, as they
       represent residual claims to future company cash flows. For example, in the
       Vale dam disaster, the Equifax data breach, and the Siemens bribery scandal
       cited earlier, all three firms experienced a sharp share price decline in the
       wake of the event.
   ■   While adverse ESG-related events also affect the value of debtholder claims,
       these finite, fixed obligations are usually less affected than equities by such
       events unless the firm’s ability to make interest and principal payments is
       adversely affected. In the Vale, Equifax, and Siemens examples, all three

60   Learning Module 2                                                       Investors and Other Stakeholders


                                  saw their respective issuer-specific cost of debt rise, and each experienced
                                  a credit rating downgrade shortly after the adverse event. Vale saw its debt
                                  rating briefly reduced to speculative grade following the dam collapse. In
                                  more extreme cases, debtholders may force a company into bankruptcy and
                                  experience significant losses in liquidation.
                             ■    In general, the effects of adverse ESG-related events often differ depend-
                                  ing on maturity. For example, an analyst may believe a coal company has
                                  long-term risk from potential asset write-downs—that is, stranded assets
                                  due to regulatory changes or shifts in demand—which would likely have a
                                  greater negative effect on debt maturing in ten years versus short-term debt
                                  maturing in twelve months.
                             Analysts evaluate potential positive and/or negative effects of material ESG-related
                         factors, whose financial impact is reflected in a company’s projected financial state-
                         ments and ratios—with future expected cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate
                         and sensitivity and/or a scenario analysis used to weigh different outcomes for debt
                         and equity holders.
                             For example, an analyst might increase her forecast of a hotel company’s operat-
                         ing costs because of the impact of excessive employee turnover—lost productivity,
                         reduced customer satisfaction, and increased expenses for employee searches, tem-
                         porary workers, and training programs. As another example, an analyst might choose
                         to lower the discount rate for a food company that is expected to gain a competitive
                         advantage by transitioning to a sustainable source of a key ingredient in its products.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Historically, analysts have best been able to evaluate a company’s:
                                 A. social practices.
                                 B. governance practices.
                                  C. environmental practices.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. Corporate governance factors are well understood and quantifi-
                                 able by analysts, including the consequences of poor corporate governance.
                                 In contrast, the inclusion of environmental and social factors in investment
                                 decision-making has evolved more slowly. The results of evaluating the
                                 effects of environmental and social factors on firm performance are often
                                 less clear.

                            2. Historically, environmental and social issues have been treated as
                               ______________. However, they are increasingly being recognized as
                               _________________. (negative externalities, internalized costs).
                                 Solution:
                                 Historically, environmental and social issues have been treated as negative
                                 externalities. However, they are increasingly being recognized as internal-
                                 ized costs.
                                 It was previously assumed that the negative consequences of poor firm deci-
                                 sions did not fall on the firm’s capital suppliers but, rather, on society. Now,
                                 analysts consider these increasingly internalized company costs by estimat-
                                 ing their effects on firm financial performance, by incorporating them into
                                 discount rates and risk assessments, and by screening or adjusting position
                                 sizes of companies that have poor ESG practices.

  3. Stranded assets best represent _____________. (physical risk, transition risk)
     Solution:
     Stranded assets best represent transition risk.
     Transition risks are losses related to the transition to a lower-carbon econo-
     my. An oil well may become a stranded asset due to government regulations
     or changes in consumer preferences that affect the price of oil or otherwise
     impair an issuer’s ability to fully realize the asset value. Physical risks include
     damage to property stemming from extreme weather, which is expected to
     increase in both frequency and severity due to climate change.

  4. Explain the importance of materiality of ESG factors for a financial analyst.
     Solution:
     An ESG factor is considered material when it has a significant impact on
     a company’s results or business model. An analyst attempts to evaluate
     potential positive or negative effects of material ESG-related factors—for ex-
     ample, by incorporating them into a company’s projected cash flows and/or
     discount rates or through an investment candidate screening process. While
     an issuer may have many ESG factors to consider, analysts prioritize those
     that are material given the opportunity cost of analysts’ time.

  5. A company’s effectiveness in managing long-term risks and sustainability is
     best classified as a:
      A. social factor.
      B. governance factor.
      C. environmental factor.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Corporate governance and stakeholder management address
     issues that include a company’s effectiveness in managing long-term risks
     and sustainability. Management effectiveness can be assessed through an
     evaluation of the company’s financial and non-financial performance over
     the long run, along with a comparison against industry peers to isolate con-
     trollable variables.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                         The following information relates to questions
                         1-3
                             Consider a firm with assets of 200 fully financed by equity and an identical firm
                             financed with 80% debt and 20% equity. Assume both firms have revenue over a
                             period of 200 and non-debt operating expenses of 140.

                         1. If we assume an interest rate of 20% for the period, calculate net income for each
                            firm and compare their returns on equity for the period, ignoring income taxes.

                         2. Calculate the return on equity for the period if the firms experience a 20% in-
                            crease and decrease in revenue (from Question 1), assuming operating expenses
                            remain unchanged.

                         3. Consider the same all-equity-financed firm as in Question 1 and its choices for
                            financing a new investment in LT assets of 40. The pertinent details in the firm’s
                            initial balance sheet are shown below. Revenue before the investment is 200, op-
                            erating expenses are 140 and are expected to remain unchanged, interest on new
                            debt financing is 20%, and the return on the new investment is 30%.
                            Calculate the ROE for the firm if it finances the investment with debt, the issu-
                            ance of new shares, or cash on hand and compare the results. Discuss the results
                            of the comparison.

Solutions                                                                                 65


   to the beginning ROE, there was no change in ROE from the initial case. Financ-
   ing with debt produced a higher ROE, because the interest rate on debt was lower
   than the return on the new investment and no new shares were issued, avoiding
   dilution. The highest ROE was produced by using excess cash on hand, which
   avoids both dilution and the interest cost of debt.

4. The supplier has a clear vested interest in the success and survival of the compa-
   ny, so it is considered a stakeholder. The supplier extends short-term credit to the
   company and has a long-term interest in the success of the company because it
   has invested in integrated complex systems. High financial leverage would not be
   in the best interest of the supplier, because it presents both short-term risk that
   the company may be unable to make payments for goods delivered and long-term
   risk for the investment made to integrate the supplier’s complex systems with
   those of the company.

5. Managers are in a principal-agent relationship with a company’s shareholders.
   Managers, overseen by the board of directors, serve as agents who should act
   in the best interests of the company’s shareholders. However, in some cases,
   managers may put their own interests ahead of shareholders’ interests. Exam-
   ples include insufficient effort, excessive perquisite consumption (e.g., corporate
   jets, elaborate offices), and failure to take appropriate risks or make invest-
   ments in an effort to safeguard their jobs. Oversight by a majority independent
   board and compensation to align managers’ interests with shareholders’, such as
   performance-based and equity-based compensation schemes, are mechanisms to
   mitigate these conflicts of interest.

INTRODUCTION
Corporations are complex structures with stakeholders beyond owners, lenders, and
                                                                                             1
managers. Corporate governance involves the creation and maintenance of a system
of checks, balances, and incentives that addresses conflicting interests among these
stakeholders. In this Learning Module, we first identify key aspects of the relation-
ships between these parties and the potential conflicts that may arise. In the second
lesson, we turn to the various mechanisms established to manage these conflicts,
settle disputes, and mitigate risk. Finally, we highlight the benefits of strong corporate
governance and stakeholder management policies as well as the risks of weak policies
and their potential impact on corporate performance.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   A principal-agent relationship is created when one party (a
           principal) hires another party (an agent) to perform a task or
           service. The relationship can exist with or without a contract. The
           agent is expected to act in the principal’s best interest.
       ■   In many cases, the agent possesses more information than the prin-
           cipal, and conflicts arise where the interests of the principal and the
           agent diverge. In a corporation, shareholders are a principal and elect
           directors (an agent), who appoint managers (another agent), who are
           charged with maximizing shareholder value.

                                ■   Given the complex ecosystem of stakeholders in a corporation, the
                                    rights, responsibilities, and powers of each stakeholder must be
                                    considered when establishing an appropriate governance structure by
                                    striking a balance among the interests of these groups while meeting
                                    corporate objectives.
                                ■   A sound governance structure consists of mechanisms to ensure
                                    adherence to rules and regulations imposed by external authorities
                                    as well as to meet the unique requirements of internal stakeholders.
                                    These mechanisms include financial reporting, general and extraordi-
                                    nary meetings, compensation, debt covenants, and more.
                                ■   Weak corporate governance, unmanaged conflicts of interest, or inad-
                                    equate stakeholder management can place firms at a competitive dis-
                                    advantage. Strong governance practices and a proper balance among
                                    stakeholders’ interests are often reflected in increased competitiveness
                                    and operational efficiency, better control processes, and improved
                                    performance.

                               In a corporation, shareholders are a(n) ________________.

                               Customers have a(n) ________________ relationship with a corporate issuer.
                               Solution:
                               In a corporation, the board of directors is elected to act as an agent.
                               In a corporation, shareholders are a principal.
                               Customers have a contractual relationship with a corporate issuer.

                               resulting in agency costs. Identify and explain an example of an agency cost
                               for a corporate issuer.<QuestionType>essay</QuestionType>
                               Solution:
                               An example of an agency cost for public companies is the cost of hiring
                               an external independent auditor for the financial statements and internal
                               controls. Audit fees are paid by the issuer, a cost borne by the shareholders,
                               to mitigate the risk that financial reports are materially misstated or deviate
                               from generally accepted accounting principles.

     an ad hoc committee may be formed by a group of bondholders to approach
     the company with potential options to restructure their bonds.
     3. C is correct. Stock-based compensation seeks to align the interests of
     management and shareholders.

                             A principal-agent relationship (or agency relationship) is created when one party
                         (a principal) hires another party (an agent) to perform a task or service and can be
                         present with or without a contract governing the relationship. An agent is expected to
                         act in the principal’s best interest, and the relationship involves trust and expectations
                         of loyalty and diligence. In many cases, the agent possesses more information than
                         the principal, which means that the principal is often unable to directly verify that the
                         agent is acting in the principal’s best interest. Conflicts arise where the interests of
                         the principal and agent diverge, resulting in agency costs, which can be direct, such
                         as the costs of hiring monitoring agents (e.g., a board of directors hiring an auditor),
                         or indirect, like the forgone profits and economic benefits of lost opportunities.
                             In a corporation, shareholders are a principal and elect directors (an agent), who
                         are expected to pursue shareholders’ interests by hiring managers (another agent) to
                         maximize shareholder value. Shareholders and lenders demand higher returns and
                         risk premiums when faced with greater information asymmetry due to the greater
                         potential for conflicts of interest. Principal-agent relationships and potential conflicts
                         arise in several areas within corporations.

Stakeholder Conflicts and Management                                                      71



Shareholder, Board Director, and Manager Relationships
Directors and managers have more information about a company’s performance,
risks, and investment opportunities than outsiders such as shareholders and lenders.
This information asymmetry lowers shareholders’ ability to assess the performance
of directors and managers, weakening their capacity to identify and dismiss poor
performers. While all companies have some degree of asymmetric information, it
is more pronounced for companies competing in many markets and geographies,
those that sell complex products, and companies with lower levels of institutional
ownership and free float.
    In practice, compensation is the principal tool used to align the interests of
management and shareholders. While management compensation seeks to motivate
managers to maximize shareholder value, manager and shareholder interests may
diverge in the following common ways:
   ■   Insufficient effort. Managers may be unable or unwilling to make invest-
       ments, manage costs appropriately, or make hard decisions like shutting
       down unprofitable business lines. They may conduct too little monitoring
       of employees or assert too little control, leading to unintentional risks and
       litigation. Finally, managers may allocate too little time to their role because
       they are committed to political or charitable activities, personal invest-
       ments, or serving as directors or managers of other companies.
   ■   Inappropriate risk appetite. Compensation dominated by stock grants
       and options can motivate excessive management risk-taking, as option
       holders participate only in upside share price moves. Similarly, little or no
       use of stock grants and options in compensation plans can lead to unduly
       risk-averse corporate decision-making and the inability to attract talent.
       This misalignment may be at odds with the company’s value creation
       objective or shareholders’ desire for higher-risk, higher-reward endeavors.
       Since investors can hold diversified portfolios, they may have a higher risk
       tolerance than managers, whose reputation and time are concentrated in a
       single company.
   ■   Empire building. Management compensation and status are typically tied to
       business size (e.g., total revenues, number of employees), which can incen-
       tivize managers to seek “growth for growth’s sake,” such as acquisitions that
       do not increase shareholder value.
   ■   Entrenchment. Directors and managers want to retain their jobs. Tactics to
       do so include copying competitors and peers, avoiding risks, and pursuing
       complicated transactions and restructurings that they are uniquely suited
       to manage. Directors may avoid speaking out against management, even if
       speaking out is in the interest of shareholders or other stakeholders.
   ■   Self-dealing. Managers may exploit firm resources to maximize personal
       benefits, such as excessive perquisites (private airplanes, club memberships,
       personal security), or defraud investors by misappropriating assets. The
       smaller a manager’s stake in the company, the less they bear these costs
       themselves, reducing their desire to maximize firm value.

                          KNOWLEDGE CHECK: SHAREHOLDER AND MANAGER/DIRECTOR
                          RELATIONSHIPS


                            1. A construction firm has the opportunity to invest in a high-risk, high-re-
                               ward capital infrastructure project. Which of the following could be a
                               reason why the company decides not to pursue the project?
                                A. The compensation of managers is closely tied to the size of the compa-
                                   ny’s business.
                                B. Management receives excessive all-cash compensation.
                                C. Management has recently received a generous options reward in the
                                   company’s shares.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. When compensation—particularly if it is excessive—is entirely
                               in cash, the risk tolerance of managers may be too low, as they are inclined
                               to protect their cash compensation. Additionally, there may be little upside
                               for them if the project performs well.
                               A is incorrect, as it describes the “empire building” phenomenon that would
                               likely result in the decision to grow the company at any cost in an attempt to
                               secure higher compensation.
                               C is incorrect, as it would likely lead to an alignment of managers’ interests
                               with those of shareholders.



                         Controlling and Minority Shareholder Relationships
                         Corporate ownership is generally classiﬁed as dispersed or concentrated. Dispersed
                         ownership involves many shareholders, none of whom can exercise control over the
                         corporation. In contrast, concentrated ownership reﬂects an individual shareholder
                         or a group (known as controlling shareholders), who can exercise control over the
                         corporation. The group may involve a family, another company (or companies), or
                         government.
                             While we have been discussing shareholders as a homogeneous group with shared
                         interests, in fact shareholders are often a heterogeneous group with different interests,
                         such as a founding family with a large percentage of their wealth held in company stock
                         who thus desire management to diversify the company to achieve stability. This desire
                         would be at odds with that of minority shareholders who hold diversified portfolios
                         and would prefer that management focus on maximizing shareholder value, as they
                         can diversify cheaply on their own. Conversely, a controlling shareholder may also be
                         a long-term shareholder with a multi-year or multi-decade perspective, while some
                         minority shareholders may seek quick gains from cost cutting, selling assets, or share
                         repurchases. Shareholders can communicate with one another and form voting blocs
                         to advocate for their interests more effectively.
                             Share ownership percentages alone may not necessarily reflect whether company
                         control is dispersed or concentrated. Differences in shareholder voting schemes, as
                         well as a share class with different voting rights, give rise to varying degrees of control
                         among shareholders. In contrast to a simple structure of one vote per shareholder,
                         a dual-class structure involves one share class (e.g., Class A) that carries one vote
                         per share and is publicly held and traded and another share class (e.g., Class B) that
                         carries several votes per share and is held exclusively by company insiders or founders.
                         A dual-class structure allows certain stakeholders to effectively control the company
                         even if they do not hold most of the shares outstanding. These stakeholders—who

can avoid voting-power dilution if new shares are issued—control board elections,
strategic decisions, and all other significant matters. CFA Institute has long advocated
against dual-class structures, because they permit one group of shareholders to have
disproportionate power and potentially override the will of the majority for their own
personal interest. In cases where dual-class structures are legal, CFA Institute advises
issuers to clearly disclose such arrangements and their implications for investors. For
more on CFA Institute’s advocacy on this and other corporate governance topics, visit
www​.cfainstitute​.org/​advocacy.
    Magna International Inc., a Canadian auto parts company, started off with two
classes of shares. Class A shares had one vote per share, and Class B shares had 500
votes per share. The founder, Frank Stronach, and his family were able to control 75%
of the voting rights while owning only 3% of the total shares by holding Class B shares.
Investors were frustrated that the founder and members of his family secured millions
in consulting fees, salaries, bonuses, and stock options despite weakness in the stock
price. Shareholders voted for a single-class share structure in an extraordinary general
meeting, creating an agreement that Stronach would leave the company after paying
out CAD870 million over five years.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK: DUAL-CLASS SHARE STRUCTURE


   1. Which of the following best describes dual-class share structures?
      A. Dual-class share structures can be easily changed over time.
      B. Company founders can maintain significant power over the
         organization.
       C. Conflicts of interest between management and stakeholder groups are
          less likely than with single-class share structures.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Under dual-class share systems, company founders may control
      board elections, strategic decisions, and other significant matters. A is
      incorrect, because dual-class share systems are difficult to dismantle once
      adopted as the voting control within dual-class systems is held exclusive-
      ly by company insiders or founders. C is incorrect, because conflicts of
      interest between management and stakeholders are more likely than with
      single-class share structures owing to the potential control element in du-
      al-class systems.

debt versus equity claims gives rise to potential conflicts of interest, as outlined in the
previous module. For example, debtholders with a fixed claim tend to be risk averse
and prefer that the corporation take actions to ensure sufficient cash flow to meet
its debt obligations. For this reason, debtholders tend to prefer that a company raise
more equity and limit shareholder distributions. Shareholders, however, tend to prefer
greater leverage and shareholder distributions rather than dilutive equity issuance.
    This potential conflict is greater for long-term debt, as the passage of time exposes
debtholders to changes in business conditions, strategy, and management behavior. As
a result, long-term creditors are more likely to impose contractual limits on leverage
and shareholder distributions.

                          KNOWLEDGE CHECK: STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS


                            1. A controlling shareholder of Stillcreek Corporation owns 55% of
                               Stillcreek’s shares, and the remaining shares are spread among a large group
                               of shareholders. In this situation, conflicts of interest are most likely to arise
                               between:
                                A. shareholders and bondholders.
                                B. the controlling shareholder and managers.
                                C. the controlling shareholder and minority shareholders.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. In this ownership structure, the controlling shareholder’s power
                               is likely more influential than that of minority shareholders. Thus, the con-
                               trolling shareholder may be able to exploit its position to the detriment of
                               the interests of the remaining shareholders. A and B are incorrect, because
                               the ownership structure in and of itself is unlikely to create material con-
                               flicts between shareholders and bondholders or shareholders and managers.



                          EXAMPLE 1

                            Leverage and Other Stakeholders: KLD Marine Ltd.
                            KLD Marine Ltd. (KLD) is a small, debt-free manufacturer of welded metal
                            boats with domestic and international sales in a highly competitive and cyclical
                            market. KLD is the primary employer in a small, remote town. Sales are through
                            a network of dealers, who typically sell three or four different boat brands. Of
                            the company’s 50 employees, about half are specialized aluminum welders, with
                            most others in sales and management. The primary purchased input for KLD’s
                            boat production is sheet aluminum. KLD’s sole aluminum supplier is a large,
                            multi-national company with many clients. KLD has never paid dividends but
                            has substantial retained earnings that finance the company’s assets. KLD has
                            recently decided to borrow heavily so it can pay a large, one-time dividend to
                            shareholders.

                            1. Which of the following stakeholder groups will be most negatively affected
                               by the increase in leverage?
                                A. The welders employed by the company
                                B. The company’s dealers
                                C. The supplier of aluminum to the business
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. As employees, the welders could face loss of employment if the
                               company were to become financially distressed with the increase in leverage.
                               And since their skills are very specialized, they would probably have diffi-
                               culty finding another job locally. In a small and remote town, employment
                               opportunities are likely to be limited for specialized workers.
                               B is incorrect. The dealers might suffer lost sales if KLD were to fail, but they
                               could likely replace KLD with a competing brand.
                               C is incorrect. The aluminum supplier would probably suffer the least im-
                               pact, since it is large and KLD is likely not a sizable proportion of its sales.

  2. Is it likely that any of these groups would be affected positively?
     Solution:
     In all cases, impacts are negative. Note that for modest borrowing, these
     effects would be minor.



QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following stakeholders are most likely to demand high-
     er returns and risk premiums when faced with greater information asymme-
     try due to the greater potential conflicts of interest?
      A. Directors and managers
      B. Suppliers and customers
      C. Shareholders and lenders
     Solution:
     C is correct. Greater information asymmetry increases risk for sharehold-
     ers and lenders, who will seek to be compensated for taking that risk with a
     lower share price or multiple and a higher yield on debt investments.
     A is incorrect, because directors and managers have more information
     about a company’s performance, risks, and investment opportunities than
     outsiders, such as shareholders and lenders.
     B is incorrect, because while suppliers and customers are outsiders with
     information asymmetry, their relationship is contractual and not based on
     investment return.

  2. An analyst is examining the governance of several companies in her cover-
     age area and learns that one of the CEOs is highly involved in political and
     charitable activities. These activities may result in which one of the follow-
     ing misalignments of interests between management and shareholders?
      A. Self-dealing
      B. Entrenchment
      C. Insufficient effort
     Solution:
     C is correct. The CEO’s outside activities could result in insufficient effort.
     Managers may allocate too little time to their role because they are commit-
     ted to political or charitable activities, personal investments, or serving as
     directors or managers of other companies.
     A and B are incorrect, because while they are both examples of misalign-
     ments between management and shareholders, they are not the primary
     concern about management involvement in charitable and political activi-
     ties, which tend to distract management rather than cause a direct conflict
     of interest or transaction that is not in shareholders’ interests.

  3. A ________________ corporate ownership structure involves many share-
     holders, none of whom can exercise control over the corporation.
     Solution:
     A dispersed corporate ownership structure involves many shareholders,
     none of whom can exercise control over the corporation.

                            4. A company’s management team, whose compensation includes significant
                               stock grants and options, is pursuing a large debt-financed acquisition. The
                               management team discusses how this acquisition may not align with the
                               interests of all stakeholders, and it is proposed that they increase equity
                               financing for the acquisition. Increasing equity financing for the transaction
                               would increase support by which stakeholder?
                                A. Debtholders
                                B. Management
                                C. Shareholders
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Debtholders with a fixed claim tend to be risk averse and prefer
                               that the corporation take actions to ensure sufficient cash flow to meet its
                               debt obligations. For this reason, debtholders tend to prefer that a company
                               raise more equity as opposed to increasing debt to a level that may increase
                               default risk.
                               B and C are incorrect, because management is aligned with shareholders
                               through stock grants and options, and shareholders tend to prefer greater
                               leverage rather than dilutive equity issuance.

                            5. Discuss the potential conflicts between controlling shareholders and mi-
                               nority shareholders in a dual-class structure.
                               Solution:
                               A dual-class structure allows stakeholders to effectively control the compa-
                               ny by virtue of their ownership of a share class with superior voting rights.
                               While it is possible for minority shareholders to change voting rights in their
                               favor, it can be difficult and expensive to do so, as illustrated by the Magna
                               International example.




             3           CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS

                                       describe corporate governance and mechanisms to manage
                                       stakeholder relationships and mitigate associated risks

                         Given the complex ecosystem of stakeholders in a corporation, the rights, responsi-
                         bilities, and powers of each must be taken into consideration when establishing an
                         appropriate governance structure by striking a balance among the interests of these
                         groups while meeting corporate objectives. A sound governance structure seeks to
                         ensure that a corporation has mechanisms in place that not only facilitate adherence
                         to rules and regulations imposed by external authorities but also meet the unique
                         requirements of internal stakeholders.

Corporate Governance Mechanisms                                                             77



Corporate Reporting and Transparency
Corporate reporting and transparency are foundational to governance. Without them,
external stakeholders would be unaware of the company’s performance and position,
and thus their ability to advocate for their interests would be severely weakened. Given
its importance, reporting is mandated and regulated through legal, regulatory, and
quasi-regulatory means (e.g., exchange listing requirements).
     Investors have access to a public company’s financial and non-financial information
through annual reports, proxy statements, company disclosures, investor relations
resources, and other sources. This reporting includes information on a company’s
operations, strategic objectives, audited financial statements, governance structure,
ownership structure, remuneration policies, related-party transactions, and risk factors.
Most jurisdictions and stock exchanges require that listed companies’ annual financial
statements be audited—and interim financial statements reviewed—by third-party
independent auditors.
     Private companies disclose information to the public only to the extent required
by regulations or voluntarily. However, they will disclose information confidentially
to their investors, but the content and form of that information are subject to nego-
tiation between stakeholders rather than standardized like the reporting by public
companies. Most jurisdictions do not require that private companies’ disclosures be
audited, though private companies are free to obtain an audit, which may improve
their terms with investors.
     Investors rely on corporate reports and information to:
   ■   assess company performance and that of its directors and managers;
   ■   make valuation and investment decisions;
   ■   vote on key corporate matters or changes; and
   ■   ensure compliance with legal commitments in debt contracts. As it is
       impractical for individual bondholders to track these bond requirements, a
       financial intermediary known as a trustee is hired to report on and manage
       payment administration for bondholders.



Shareholder Mechanisms
As residual owners of the company, shareholders seek to protect their ownership
claims through a variety of control mechanisms over the company. While no standard
set of shareholder rights exists, global investors usually rely on common rights and
mechanisms outlined in the following sections. These mechanisms are often enshrined
in securities laws and enforced by regulators.

Shareholder Meetings
General meetings—or an annual general meeting (AGM), typically held once a year—
enable shareholders to participate in discussions and vote on matters and transactions
that are not delegated to the board of directors. Common matters presented for a
shareholder vote at AGMs include the following:
   ■   Board member elections
   ■   Appointment of independent auditor
   ■   Approval of annual financial statements, dividends, and director and auditor
       compensation
   ■   Approval of equity-based compensation plans
   ■   “Say on pay” non-binding votes on compensation plans

                             Extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) may be called when other resolutions
                         requiring shareholder approval are proposed, or when requested by a specified min-
                         imum number of calling shareholders (or proportion of stock outstanding). Matters
                         presented for a shareholder vote at EGMs are idiosyncratic but commonly include
                         the following:
                             ■    Special elections of board members, usually proposed by shareholders
                             ■    Amendments to bylaws or articles of association
                             ■    Mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, and asset sales
                             ■    Capital increases
                             ■    Voluntary firm liquidation
                             Shareholders unable to attend a meeting in person usually authorize another
                         party to vote on their behalf in a proxy voting process, typically by submitting a
                         ballot electronically or by mail. Proxy voting is the most common form of investor
                         participation in general meetings.

                            1. Which of the following statements about extraordinary general
                               meetings (EGMs) of shareholders is true?
                                 A. The appointment of external auditors occurs during an EGM.
                                 B. A corporation provides an overview of corporate performance at an
                                    EGM.
                                  C. An amendment to a corporation’s bylaws typically occurs during an
                                     EGM.
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. An amendment to corporate bylaws would normally take place
                                 during an EGM, which concerns significant changes to a company, such as
                                 bylaw amendments. A and B are incorrect, because the appointment of ex-
                                 ternal auditors and a corporate performance overview would typically take
                                 place during the AGM.


                         Shareholder Activism
                         Shareholder activism involves investor strategies to compel a company to act in a
                         desired manner. The primary motivation of shareholder activists is to increase share-
                         holder value relatively quickly, although some activism involves social, political, or
                         environmental considerations. Shareholder activists often pressure management to
                         act using tactics such as initiating proxy fights, proposing shareholder resolutions,
                         and publicizing issues of contention.
                             Hedge funds are among the predominant shareholder activists. Unlike most institu-
                         tional investors, hedge funds base the majority of their fees on returns, granting them
                         a significant stake in the financial success of an activist campaign. Also, hedge funds
                         face fewer investment restrictions and are therefore able to take on large share positions
                         using borrowed funds. Regulated investment entities such as mutual funds, however,
                         are subject to investment restrictions (e.g., limitations on maximum position size,
                         leverage, and ownership of distressed or illiquid securities) that limit these activities,
                         although some large funds use their influence to encourage positive corporate action.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK


   1. Which of the following best describes shareholder activists? Share-
      holder activists:
      A. help stabilize a company’s strategic direction.
      B. have little effect on the company’s long-term investors.
       C. are unlikely to alter the composition of a company’s shareholder base.
      Solution:
      A is correct. Shareholder activists often narrow a company’s strategic direc-
      tion to focus on the few things that the company has historically done well,
      often shedding assets and closing divisions in the process.
      B is incorrect, because long-term investors in a company need to consider
      how shareholder activists affect the company, especially if the company is
      restructured and management is replaced.
      C is incorrect, because an activist is likely to change the investment thesis
      for a company toward restructuring, which may prompt a change in the
      shareholder base.


Shareholder Litigation
Shareholder activists may pursue additional tactics, such as litigation or lawsuits. One
prominent type is shareholder derivative lawsuits (unrelated to financial derivative
contracts), which are legal proceedings initiated against the board of directors, manage-
ment, and/or controlling shareholders by a shareholder deemed to be acting on behalf
of the company in place of its directors and officers, who have failed to adequately
act for the benefit of the company. In many countries, laws restrict shareholders from
pursuing legal action by either imposing minimum shareholder interest thresholds
for such lawsuits or prohibiting them altogether.

Corporate Takeovers
Changes in corporate control via a takeover by shareholders or an acquirer may
be pursued in several ways. One mechanism is the proxy contest (or proxy fight).
In a proxy contest, a group seeking a controlling position on a company’s board of
directors attempts to persuade shareholders to vote for the group. Managerial teams
can also be displaced through tender offers and hostile takeovers, which seek to
take over a company through control of the board and thus management. A tender
offer involves an invitation to shareholders to sell their interests directly to a group
seeking to gain control. A contest for corporate control may attract arbitrageurs and
takeover specialists, who facilitate transfers of control by purchasing shares from
existing shareholders in the target company and later selling shares to the highest
bidder. A hostile takeover is an attempt to acquire a company without the consent of
the company’s management.
     Preservation of employment serves as an incentive for board members and man-
agers to focus on shareholder wealth maximization. The threat of removal, however,
can also have negative implications for a company’s corporate governance practices
if the company adopts anti-takeover measures, such as staggered board elections or a
shareholder rights plan (commonly known as a poison pill), to reduce the likelihood of

                         shareholder rights plan enables shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount
                         if another shareholder purchases a certain percentage of the company’s shares. Such
                         plans increase takeover costs to any potential bidder.


                         Creditor Mechanisms
                         Creditors, including private lenders like banks as well as public bondholders, have
                         several mechanisms available to protect their interests. The rights of creditors are
                         established by laws and according to contracts executed with the company. Laws vary
                         by jurisdiction but commonly contain provisions to protect creditors’ interests and
                         provide legal recourse.

                         Bond Indenture
                         The rights of bondholders are established through contracts executed with the company.
                         A bond indenture is a legal contract that describes the structure of a bond, the obli-
                         gations of the company, and the rights of the bondholders. The terms and conditions
                         of lending agreements either require the company to perform certain actions (or meet
                         certain requirements) or prohibit certain actions. Bondholders may also require that
                         certain assets be pledged by an issuer to secure its promise to repay its obligations.

                         Creditor Committees
                         In some countries, official creditor committees, particularly for unsecured bondholders,
                         are established once a company files for bankruptcy. Such committees are expected
                         to represent bondholders during bankruptcy proceedings and to protect bondholder
                         interests in restructuring or liquidation.
                             When a company is struggling to meet its obligations under an indenture, an ad
                         hoc committee may be formed by a group of bondholders to approach the company
                         with potential options to restructure their bonds. While members of an ad hoc com-
                         mittee do not officially represent all bondholders, their interests are often aligned
                         with those of the broader bondholder group.


                         Board and Management Mechanisms
                         While the board of directors is central to a company’s governance structure, boards
                         routinely delegate specific functions to committees composed of a subset of their
                         members. Board committees thoroughly consider, review, monitor, and follow up
                         on matters that fall within their mandates, which may require specific expertise or
                         independence.
                             Exhibit 2 outlines the three most common board committees (sometimes referred
                         to as “core committees”), recommended by most corporate governance codes and
                         required by some stock exchanges.

Corporate Governance Mechanisms                                                                     81



  Exhibit 2: Core Board Committees and Key Oversight Functions


                                     Board of Directors




           Audit Committee         Nominating/Governance         Compensation/Remuneration
     – Audit and control systems          Committee                       Committee
     – Financial reporting          – Director selection    – Director and executive compensation
                                    – Governance policies




These committees provide recommendations and reports to the board on a regular
basis. When establishing committees, boards do not delegate their ultimate responsi-
bility nor are they discharged of their duties. The board is required to review, challenge,
and assure the content of any reports raised to it by the committees and to make the
proper decisions.

Audit Committee
The audit committee is the most widely required and established board committee,
which, according to best practices, should be composed solely of independent board
members and include at least one director with accounting or financial management
expertise. The audit committee monitors the issuer’s financial reporting process,
including the proper selection and implementation of accounting policies according to
accounting standards and regulations in order to ensure the integrity of the financial
statements. It supervises the internal audit function and ensures its independence
and competence. The audit committee is also responsible for recommending the
appointment of an independent external auditor and proposing its remuneration. It
interacts and holds meetings with the external auditor. It receives reports from the
internal and external auditors, proposes remedial actions for highlighted issues or
matters, and follows up on them. In some cases, the audit committee may also oversee
information technology security.

Nominating/Governance Committee
The nominating, or governance, committee is also typically composed of indepen-
dent members, in accordance with best practices. This committee appraises director
and manager candidates and oversees the board election process. It sets nomination
procedures and policies, including board directorship criteria, the search for and
identification of qualified candidates for board directorships, and the election process
by shareholders. In designing its policies and in nominating candidates to the board,
the committee ensures that the structure of the board is balanced and in alignment
with governance principles and applicable codes.
    The committee also oversees the establishment and enforcement of corporate
policies, including:
    ■   a corporate governance code;
    ■   the charter of the board and its committees;
    ■   a code of ethics; and
    ■   a policy on conflicts of interest, among others.

                             It reviews these policies periodically to incorporate any necessary changes or
                         developments. Most importantly, it ensures implementation of governance policies,
                         compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the pursuit of appropriate action
                         if any issues or violations are identified. For example, policies on conflicts of interest
                         and related-party transactions require directors and managers to disclose any actual
                         or potential conflict of interest related to the company, as well as any material interests
                         in a transaction that may affect the company.

                         Compensation/Remuneration Committee
                         The compensation, or remuneration, committee develops and proposes remuneration
                         policies for the directors and key executives, which often includes setting performance
                         criteria and evaluating manager performance. Executive compensation attracts signif-
                         icant investor attention, with a focus on aligning manager and shareholder interests.
                         The laws in most jurisdictions, as well as best practices, require all compensation
                         committee members to be independent directors because management should not
                         assess its own performance.
                             Compensation plans often include a variable component—typically profit sharing,
                         stock, or stock options—contingent on corporate or stock price performance. However,
                         stock-based remuneration does not serve its purpose if managers can improve their
                         personal gains at the expense of the company while limiting their exposure to weak
                         stock performance. As a result, companies are increasingly designing incentive plans
                         that discourage “short-termism” or excessive risk-taking by managers. Some incen-
                         tive plans include granting shares, rather than options, to managers and restricting
                         their vesting or sale for several years or until retirement. A long-term incentive plan
                         delays compensation, either in part or in total, until a company’s strategic objectives
                         (typically performance targets) are met.
                             As a result of laws such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the USA or by choice, issuers
                         are increasingly seeking shareholder views on executive compensation by conducting
                         non-binding “say on pay” votes at the AGM. By allowing shareholders to express their
                         views on remuneration-related matters, companies can limit the discretion of directors
                         in granting excessive or inadequate remuneration.

                         Additional Committees
                         Companies can have multiple other board committees, which are often industry
                         specific. Risk committees—common (in some jurisdictions, required) in the financial
                         services industry—determine the risk profile and appetite of the company and ensure
                         that the company has an enterprise risk management system in place whereby risks
                         are identified, assessed, mitigated, and managed appropriately. Accordingly, risk com-
                         mittees oversee the setting of the risk policy and risk management annual plans and
                         monitor their implementation. Insurance companies often have investment committees
                         that ensure the company has adopted and adheres to rational and prudent investment
                         and capital management policies.


                         Employee Mechanisms
                         By managing employee relationships, companies seek to respect employees’ rights
                         and avoid legal or reputational risks associated with employment matters. Employee
                         relationship management (sometimes called human capital management) helps firms
                         attract and retain talent and ensure that employees fulfill their responsibilities and
                         are motivated to act in the company’s best interest.
                             Employee rights are primarily protected through jurisdiction-specific labor laws,
                         which define the standards for employees’ rights and responsibilities and cover such
                         matters as work hours, post-employment, health care and other benefit coverage,
                         and paid leave. In most countries, employees have the right to form unions. Unions

Corporate Governance Mechanisms                                                              83


advocate on behalf of members to influence certain matters affecting employees,
such as compensation and working conditions. Although not a common practice in
many parts of the world, in some countries employees are represented on the board
of directors—or supervisory board—of companies meeting certain size or ownership
criteria (e.g., in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg).
    At the individual level, employment contracts specify the various rights and
responsibilities of the employer and employee. Some companies have an employee
stock ownership plan (ESOP) to help retain employees and further align their inter-
ests with those of the company. As part of an ESOP, a company establishes a fund
consisting of shares and/or cash, which are granted to employees based on service or
performance criteria and often include vesting periods.


Customer and Supplier Mechanisms
Both customers and suppliers enter into contractual agreements with a company that
specify the products and services underlying the relationship, the prices or fees and
the payment terms, the rights and responsibilities of each party, the after-sale rela-
tionship, and any guarantees. Contracts also specify actions to be taken and recourse
available if either party breaches the terms of the contract.
    Customers, owners, and other stakeholders increasingly use social media to
voice or protect their interests or to enhance their influence on corporate matters.
For example, negative media attention can adversely affect the reputation or public
perception of a company or its managers and directors. Through social media, these
stakeholders can instantly broadcast information with little cost or effort and are thus
better able to compete with company management in influencing public sentiment.


Government Mechanisms

Laws and Regulations
Governments and regulatory authorities develop laws that companies must follow
and monitor companies’ compliance with those laws. Such laws protect and enforce
property and contract rights, in addition to protecting the rights of a specific group
such as consumers or the environment. Industries whose services, products, or oper-
ations are more likely to affect the public or stakeholder interests are typically subject
to greater regulation. Examples include financial services, health care, and agriculture
and food, as well as industries deemed to be in the national interest (e.g., defense).

Corporate Governance Codes
Many regulatory authorities have adopted corporate governance codes that consist of
guiding principles for publicly traded companies. These codes require companies to
disclose their adoption of recommended corporate governance practices or explain
why they have not done so, known as a “comply or explain” approach. In Japan, for
example, companies with no outside directors must justify why appointing outside
directors is not appropriate. Some jurisdictions do not have national corporate gov-
ernance codes but do make use of national corporate laws or regulations (e.g., Chile)
or stock exchange listing requirements (e.g., India) to achieve similar objectives.
    The USA does not have a national corporate governance code or law but does have
national securities laws (e.g., the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) that are
enforced by a national regulator (the Securities and Exchange Commission). US stock
exchanges have listing requirements that include numerous governance provisions,

                         such as the requirement for majority independent boards. Additionally, most US com-
                         panies are incorporated in a single state, Delaware, which does have state corporate
                         laws that, in effect, serve the same purpose as a national corporate governance code.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Which of the following is typically used to represent creditors’
                               interests?
                                A. Ad hoc committee
                                B. Poison pill
                                C. Tender offer
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. An ad hoc committee is a group of creditors who approach an
                               issuer in financial distress with options for debt restructuring.
                               B is incorrect. A poison pill is used to protect shareholders, management,
                               and the board from takeovers that could potentially undervalue the compa-
                               ny or are otherwise unwanted.
                               C is incorrect. A tender offer involves an invitation to shareholders to sell
                               their interests directly to a group seeking to gain control.

                            2. A primary responsibility of a board’s audit committee does not include:
                                A. oversight of accounting policies.
                                B. adoption of proper corporate governance.
                                C. recommending remuneration for the external auditor.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. The adoption of proper corporate governance is the responsi-
                               bility of a corporation’s governance committee.
                               A and C are incorrect, because oversight of accounting policies and recom-
                               mending remuneration for the external auditor are responsibilities of the
                               audit committee.

                            3. Which of the following is true of shareholder activism?
                                A. Shareholder activists rarely include hedge funds.
                                B. Regulators play a prominent role in shareholder activism.
                                C. A primary goal of shareholder activism is to increase shareholder
                                   value.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Although shareholder activism may involve social and political
                               issues, shareholder activists’ primary motivation is to increase shareholder
                               value.
                               A is incorrect, because hedge funds commonly serve as shareholder
                               activists.
                               B is incorrect, because regulators play a prominent role in standard setting,
                               not shareholder activism.

                            4. True or False: Investors receive information similar in content and form,
                               including audited disclosures, from both private and public companies.
                                A. True

Corporate Governance Risks and Benefits                                                   85


      B. False
     Solution:
     False. Private companies disclose information confidentially to their inves-
     tors, but the content and form of that information are subject to negotiation
     rather than standardized and regulated like the reporting by public compa-
     nies. Most jurisdictions do not require that private companies’ disclosures
     be audited, though they are free to obtain an audit.

  5. Explain why staggered board elections weaken corporate governance.
     Solution:
     Staggered board elections can dilute shareholder voting rights by prevent-
     ing shareholders from replacing the entire board at any given election. For
     example, if only 25% of the board is elected per year, it can take an activist
     three years to replace a majority of the board.

  6. A company’s compensation committee seeking to discourage excessive
     risk-taking by managers is most likely to design an incentive compensation
     plan that:
      A. allows directors and managers to have greater discretion over their
         remuneration.
      B. includes a variable component comprising stock options contingent on
         near-term stock performance.
      C. grants shares, rather than options, that vest over several years and are
         subject to minimum holding requirements.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Granting shares, rather than options, that vest over several
     years and must be held discourages “short-termism” or excessive risk-taking
     by managers.
     A is incorrect. By allowing shareholders to express their views on remuner-
     ation matters, companies can limit the discretion of directors and managers
     in granting themselves excessive (or inadequate) remuneration, thus not
     allowing managers to have greater discretion over their own pay.
     B is incorrect, because a variable component comprising stock options con-
     tingent on near-term stock performance may encourage excessive risk-tak-
     ing by managers. Stock-based remuneration does not serve its purpose if
     managers can improve their personal gains at the expense of the company
     while limiting their exposure to weak stock performance.

                         at a competitive disadvantage to industry peers. In contrast, strong governance
                         practices and a proper balance among stakeholders’ interests are often reflected in
                         increased competitiveness and operational efficiency, better control processes, and
                         improved performance. The role of corporate governance and related mechanisms in
                         mitigating risk extends beyond operations to include legal, regulatory, reputational,
                         and financial risks.


                         Operational Risks and Benefits
                         Corporations with weak control systems, ineffective decision-making, or inefficient
                         monitoring often face adverse results with respect to their operations, performance,
                         and value. In the absence of adequate controls, one stakeholder group may benefit at
                         the expense of others. For example, when the information available to managers is
                         superior to that received by the board or shareholders, audit procedures are poor, or
                         oversight is lacking, managers can make decisions solely for their own benefit. The
                         following example demonstrates the level of fraud and mismanagement that can occur
                         when corporate governance is inadequate.

                          THE RISE AND FALL OF THERANOS INC.

                            Founded in 2003, Theranos raised over USD700 million from venture capital
                            and private investors and was valued at USD10 billion in 2014. The company
                            and its founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, sought to revolutionize health care
                            with breakthrough technology to inexpensively and rapidly identify numerous
                            medical conditions using a test based on a single drop of blood. Its board featured
                            a variety of famous and influential directors over its history, including former
                            US Secretaries of State and directors of the US Centers for Disease Control
                            and Prevention.
                                In 2015, questions began to surface publicly around the company’s blood-test-
                            ing technology. Whistleblowers came forward to voice concerns about ques-
                            tionable practices, and it became clear that the technology was flawed and that
                            blood test results had been falsified. In 2018, the company, CEO Holmes, and
                            COO Ramesh Balwani were charged with “massive fraud” by the US SEC and
                            the company ceased operations, resulting in a total loss to its shareholders as
                            well as losses to other stakeholders. Holmes was found guilty of four counts of
                            fraud in 2022.
                                Subsequent investigations uncovered many corporate governance failures
                            at Theranos related to inadequate board composition and oversight, including
                            the following:
                                ■   While the board was composed of highly accomplished and well-
                                    known individuals, most had little to no knowledge of medical
                                    technology.
                                ■   Given its lack of medical technology expertise, the board should have
                                    hired an independent expert to validate Theranos’s innovative tech-
                                    nology, which it failed to do. An expert would also have informed the
                                    board of the lack of peer-reviewed publications by Theranos, which is
                                    highly irregular in the industry.
                                ■   The board failed to raise concerns about not only the conflict of inter-
                                    est regarding Holmes’s romantic relationship with Balwani but also his
                                    leadership role despite a lack of relevant industry experience.

Corporate Governance Risks and Benefits                                                       87


       ■   The board dismissed fraud allegations raised by whistleblowers and
           remained silent even after the whistleblowers were fired soon after
           making their allegations.
       ■   Finally, Theranos operated without filling key management roles such
           as CFO and global compliance officer, among others.

    Strong governance practices involve proper scrutiny and control at all corporate
levels. These mechanisms allow for the mitigation of risk factors such as fraud, or
at least their identification and control at early stages. Controls are enhanced when
overseen by an effective independent audit committee. By having procedures for
monitoring compliance with internal and external policies and regulations and for
reporting any violations, a firm can mitigate the risks of being exposed to regulator
questioning or legal proceedings and their associated costs.
    In addition, formal procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest and related-party
transactions ensure fair dealing and avoid hidden costs associated with preferential
or unfair treatment in favor of a related party.
    Effective governance also clarifies the delegation of authority and the reporting
lines across a company, ensuring that employees have a clear understanding of their
respective responsibilities. In addition, the governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)
functions in the organization work in partnership to align interests. These arrangements
improve decision-making processes and provide managers with flexibility to respond
to opportunities and challenges in a constantly changing environment.
    Internal auditors and other internal control mechanisms like compliance and
legal departments are an equally important pillar of organizational and governance
structures, as they aim to ensure that decisions and activities are properly monitored
and controlled to prevent risks and misconduct. These mechanisms improve the oper-
ational efficiency of the company. Similarly, when the board defines the risk profile of
the firm, sets its strategic direction, and supervises its implementation, managerial
decisions and firm operations are better aligned with shareholder interests, paving
the way for better operational results.


Legal, Regulatory, and Reputational Risks and Benefits
Compliance weaknesses in the implementation of regulatory requirements or the
lack of proper reporting practices may expose a company to legal, regulatory, or
reputational risks. In such cases, the company may be investigated by government
or regulatory authorities for violation of applicable laws. A company may also be
vulnerable to lawsuits filed by shareholders, employees, creditors, or other parties for
breach of contractual agreements or company bylaws or for violation of stakeholders’
legal rights. Improperly managed conflicts of interest or governance failures can cause
reputational harm to a company, and its associated costs can be significant. Such risks
are particularly acute for publicly listed companies subject to scrutiny by investors,
analysts, and other market participants, as in the following example.

VOLKSWAGEN AG AND DIESELGATE

   In 2014, an independent study revealed that certain Volkswagen (VW) diesel
   automobiles had abnormally high emissions in excess of legal limits. VW insisted
   for a year that the excess emissions were due to technical conditions before
   admitting to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2015 that it
   had deliberately manipulated emission test results using illegal software. The

                            emissions software was installed in as many as 11 million Volkswagen and Audi
                            vehicles worldwide, 500,000 of which were sold in the USA. Legal action was
                            taken by governments in the USA, the EU, and elsewhere.
                                Whether company executives were aware of the illegal software remains
                            unanswered. However, Volkswagen’s reputation was severely damaged amid
                            concerns about board independence, proper governance and oversight of the
                            employees who installed the software, and the blatant violation of air quality
                            standards in the communities where the cars were sold. While legal action
                            continues against the company, its management, and certain employees, the
                            impact of the scandal includes the following:
                                ■   VW’s share price immediately fell by over a third in the days following
                                    the announcement of the scandal.
                                ■   VW CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned in 2015 and was criminally
                                    indicted in the USA and Germany on fraud and conspiracy charges.
                                ■   Volkswagen AG has incurred over EUR32 billion (USD37.7 billion) in
                                    vehicle recalls, fines, and legal costs.
                                ■   Ongoing shareholder lawsuits seek settlements against manage-
                                    ment and board directors totaling several billion euros in additional
                                    damages.

                             This example illustrates the importance of a company’s reputation being based on
                         strong governance and the ability to protect the interests of stakeholders, including
                         customers, government authorities, and ultimately, in Volkswagen’s case, sharehold-
                         ers. Employees, creditors, customers, and suppliers often seek to build and maintain
                         long-term relationships with companies that have a reputation for respecting con-
                         stituent and stakeholder rights. Such a reputation can enhance a company’s ability
                         to attract talent, secure capital, improve sales, and reach better terms with suppliers.
                         In addition, ethics education and training for key stakeholders help support strong
                         governance practices. Effective governance enables a company to mitigate risks, under-
                         lying conflicts of interest, and agency problems and to maintain stable operations.


                         Financial Risks and Benefits
                         Poor corporate governance, including weak management of creditors’ interests, can
                         affect a company’s financial position and hinder its ability to honor its debt obligations.
                         A rise in the possibility of corporate default has consequences well beyond creditors
                         and shareholders, extending to managers, employees, and suppliers, and even society
                         and the environment.
                             Governance arrangements that seek to manage creditor conflicts of interest restrict
                         those corporate actions that would hinder the company’s ability to repay its debt and
                         thus reduce its default risk. Default risks are also mitigated by the proper functioning
                         of audit systems, the transparency and better reporting of earnings, and the control
                         of information asymmetries between the company and its capital providers. Lower
                         default risks are associated with a lower cost of debt, as creditors typically require
                         a lower return when their funds are better secured and their rights are protected.
                             Governance practices at shareholder meetings, as well as internal corporate
                         mechanisms such as the board of directors and its committees, give investors greater
                         assurance that their capital is well managed. These mechanisms help assure investors
                         that their rights to participate in discussions, vote on important matters, and enjoy fair
                         and equal treatment are protected. Investor confidence and the company’s credibility in
                         the marketplace are also enhanced by the appropriate and timely disclosure of material
                         information concerning operating, financial, and governance activities. The improved

Corporate Governance Risks and Benefits                                                                           89


transparency, the integrity of financial reporting processes, and an independent audit
promote the trust of shareholders and market participants in both the quality of the
firm’s reported earnings and the fair representation of its financial position. These
controls reduce investors’ risk perception of well-governed firms and, therefore, the
return required on capital invested in such firms. Consequently, good governance
enhances the attractiveness of firms to investors, improves their valuations and stock
performance, and reduces their cost of equity.1 Studies have shown the following:
    ■    Improved corporate governance practices increase the likelihood of a credit
         rating upgrade from speculative to investment grade, reducing the cost of
         debt.2
    ■    Listed companies with experienced audit committees possessing financial
         expertise tend to have stronger market performance during a crisis.3
    ■    Board diversity and independence appear to be key factors in firm
         valuation.4
   Key questions analysts should consider about a company’s corporate governance
and stakeholder management include the following:
    ■    What is the company’s ownership and voting structure?
    ■    Do board members’ skills and experience match the current and future
         needs of the company?
    ■    How closely does the management team’s compensation and incentive struc-
         ture align with factors expected to drive overall company results?
    ■    Who are the significant investors in the company?
    ■    How strong are company shareholder rights versus its peers?
    ■    How effective is the company in managing long-term risks and
         sustainability?
   An analysis of these areas and questions—for which a company’s proxy statements,
annual reports, and sustainability reports are a good starting point—can provide
important insights about the quality of management and sources of potential risk.

                               A is incorrect, because improved operating efficiency may indeed be a bene-
                               fit of an effective corporate governance structure.
                               B is incorrect, because an effective governance structure can reduce inves-
                               tors’ perceived credit risk of a corporation, thus potentially lowering the
                               corporation’s cost of debt.

                            2. An investment analyst would likely be most concerned about an executive
                               compensation plan that:
                                A. varies each year.
                                B. is consistent with the compensation plans of a company’s competitors.
                                C. is cash-based only, without an equity component.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. If an executive remuneration plan offers cash only, the interests
                               of management and investors (and other stakeholders) may be misaligned.
                               An equity-based compensation plan is commonly used to align management
                               interests with those of shareholders.
                               A is incorrect, because a plan that varies over time would typically be of less
                               concern to an analyst compared with one that did not change.
                               B is incorrect, because an analyst would likely be concerned if a company’s
                               executives were under- or overcompensated relative to competitors.

                            3. Benefits of effective corporate governance include all of the following except:
                                A. avoidance of fraud.
                                B. higher investor confidence.
                                C. reduced cost of equity.
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Effective corporate governance allows for the mitigation, not
                               the avoidance, of risk factors such as fraud, or at least their identification
                               and control at early stages.
                               B and C are incorrect, as these are both benefits of effective corporate
                               governance.

                            4. Your colleague suggests that governance and controls are bureaucratic and
                               slow down decision-making and value creation at companies. Discuss.
                               Solution:
                               Strong governance practices and a proper balance among stakeholders’
                               interests are often reflected in increased competitiveness and operational ef-
                               ficiency, better control processes, and improved performance. Studies have
                               shown that listed companies with experienced audit committees possessing
                               financial expertise tend to have stronger market performance during a crisis,
                               and board independence and diversity appear to be key factors in firm valu-
                               ation—particularly for initial public offerings—and play an important role in

  5. True or False: So long as employees are not represented by labor unions or
     collective bargaining agreements, management and the board can ignore
     employee relations.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     False. For many companies, employees (human capital) are a crucial input
     to success and the largest category of cost. Employee relations are import-
     ant whether or not employees are represented by labor unions or collective
     bargaining agreements, as the quality of their work directly affects customer
     experience and product or service quality. Employee attrition, productivity
     losses, the need for repeat training, and poor practices discussed in the press
     or social media are costly and could result in regulatory action. Companies
     that build and maintain positive, long-term relationships with employees
     can develop a competitive advantage.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                         The following information relates to questions
                         1-5
                             Kobe Steel Ltd. is a major Japanese steel manufacturer formed in 1905 that
                             supplies global manufacturers of cars, planes, and trains. The company issued a
                             report in March 2018 apologizing for falsifying data on the strength and durabil-
                             ity of its aluminum, copper, steel products, and iron ore powder. Following the
                             scandal, its stock sank to a five-year low and its cost of debt jumped to record
                             levels.
                             An Independent Investigation Committee (IIC) investigated the misconduct and
                             authored the report, which concluded that the misconduct resulted from (1) a
                             management style that overemphasized profitability amid inadequate corporate
                             governance, (2) the imbalanced operation of plants that resulted in reduced
                             awareness of quality compliance among employees, and (3) insufficient quality
                             control procedures that allowed the misconduct to take place. The report also
                             emphasized that the company had “a culture that prioritized winning purchase
                             orders and meeting delivery deadlines over ensuring quality.”
                             The company committed to implementing various measures to prevent a re-
                             currence of the misconduct. Regarding governance, measures included the
                             following:
                             ■   Appointing an independent chairman of the board of directors
                             ■   Having at least one-third of the board of directors be independent
                             ■   Creating a nominating and compensation committee, consisting of a major-
                                 ity of independent directors, to serve as a voluntary advisory body to the
                                 board of directors
                             ■   Creating an independent quality supervision committee consisting of exter-
                                 nal experts
                             ■   Creating an audit and supervisory committee consisting of five members:
                                 two internal directors and three independent directors with backgrounds in
                                 legal, financial, and industrial fields

                         1. Identify three key stakeholder relationships for Kobe Steel and discuss their role
                            in the misconduct or how they were affected.

                         2. Discuss the stakeholder incentives and the conflicts that arose between Kobe’s
                            management and the company’s customers.

                         3. Which of the following is considered a best practice that would strengthen the
                            measures discussed to prevent a recurrence of the misconduct?
                             A. A shareholder rights plan

                             B. A stock-based compensation plan

                             C. An audit committee composed solely of independent board members

                         4. Discuss the financial risk implications of the post-scandal stock and bond prices

                         2. The company supplied potentially faulty steel and other material inputs to
                            manufacturers of cars, planes, and trains. The customers were incentivized by
                            the advertised quality of the products, while management was incentivized by
                            winning purchase orders and meeting delivery deadlines. A certain quality stan-
                            dard should have aligned interests, but instead the potential for profits created a
                            conflict between the directors and customers.

                         3. C is correct. The company formed an audit and supervisory committee that in-
                            cluded a majority of independent directors, but best practices would recommend
                            an audit committee composed solely of independent members, with at least one
                            director with accounting or related financial management experience.
                            A is incorrect. A shareholder rights plan, also known as a poison pill, is used to
                            defend against unwanted takeovers that could potentially undervalue the compa-
                            ny, but it does not defend the company or shareholders against management or
                            employee misconduct.
                            B is incorrect. A stock-based compensation plan is used to align the interests
                            of management with those of shareholders, though it might further incentivize
                            risk-taking and misconduct, which is the issue in this case.

                         4. The stock price fell and the cost of debt increased, indicating that investor and
                            creditor confidence in the company declined. Investors will have to assess how
                            much the company’s financial results benefited from the past misconduct and
                            estimate the impact from (1) the company no longer falsifying data and (2) the
                            loss of customer confidence even if the company fixes the issues. Strengthening
                            governance to include best practices is a first step toward restoring investor con-
                            fidence, but the impact on future sales and profitability is key to the stock price
                            and cost of debt going forward.

5. C is correct. The misconduct likely caused reputational damage to Kobe among
   current and prospective customers, which reduces growth opportunities.
   A is incorrect, because bond yields jumped to record levels soon after the scandal
   was announced, suggesting a higher perceived default risk. Higher default risks
   are associated with a higher cost of debt, as creditors typically require a higher
   return when their funds are less secured and their rights less protected.
   B is incorrect, because Kobe is incurring higher agency costs in the wake of the
   governance failure by hiring an independent investigative committee, indepen-
   dent directors, and external quality assurance experts.

INTRODUCTION
Earlier lessons introduced the balance sheet of corporate issuers, composed of assets
                                                                                               1
financed by liabilities (including debt) and equity. This learning module covers the
analysis of short-term assets and liabilities, those that result in cash inflows or outflows
within a year. The behavior of these assets and liabilities is primarily determined by
an issuer’s payment and delivery terms with its customers and suppliers. Subsequent
modules cover issuers’ long-term assets, liabilities, and equity financing. Short-term
assets and liabilities are a key determinant of an issuer’s ability to generate cash flows
for investors, and mismatches between the timing and liquidity of assets and liabilities
can have catastrophic effects on a firm. For these reasons and others, analysts closely
scrutinize issuers’ cash conversion and liquidity.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Issuers invest cash to generate revenues and profits. The cash
           conversion cycle is the length of time from paying suppliers to
           collecting cash from customers.
       ■   The cash conversion cycle is measured as the sum of days of inventory
           on hand and days sales outstanding, less days payable outstanding. A
           short cash conversion cycle means that an issuer converts an invest-
           ment in inventory into cash quickly, while a long cash conversion cycle
           means that an issuer converts its inventory investments into cash
           slowly.

                                ■   Collecting cash from customers sooner, delaying payments to suppli-
                                    ers, and reducing inventory levels relative to sales improve an issuer’s
                                    cash conversion cycle.
                                ■   Working capital is defined as an issuer’s short-term assets minus its
                                    short-term liabilities. Net working capital adjusts for non-operating
                                    accounts such as cash, marketable securities, and short-term debt. The
                                    ratio of net working capital to sales is closely related to an issuer’s cash
                                    conversion cycle a long cash conversion cycle is associated with higher
                                    net working capital to sales, while a short cash conversion cycle is
                                    associated with lower net working capital to sales.
                                ■   An issuer’s liquidity is primarily determined by the relative amounts
                                    and liquidity of its short-term assets and liabilities, which are deter-
                                    mined by the issuer’s business model. The long-run primary source
                                    of liquidity for most issuers is cash flow from operations. Secondary
                                    sources of liquidity are typically used in crises and impose significant
                                    costs, such as issuing equity, renegotiating contracts, selling assets,
                                    and filing for bankruptcy protection.
                                ■   Drags and pulls on liquidity affect an issuer’s liquidity situation. Drags
                                    on liquidity reduce cash inflows and include such issues as uncollect-
                                    ible receivables and obsolete inventory. Pulls on liquidity are accelera-
                                    tions in cash outflows or interruptions in credit.
                                ■   Issuers may adopt a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach
                                    to working capital management, and these approaches differ in the
                                    amount of working capital held on the balance sheet as well as in their
                                    reliance on external financing and the composition of short- and long-
                                    term financing.

                               cash conversion cycle?
                                A. Buying short-term marketable securities using cash on hand
                                B. Offering customers a discount for payment received within 10 days
                                C. Slowing of sales of certain goods due to changing preferences in styles
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. A prompt-payment discount would likely reduce days sales
                               outstanding and, in turn, decrease the issuer’s cash conversion cycle.
                               A is incorrect, because increasing marketable securities by reducing cash
                               does not affect the issuer’s cash conversion cycle.
                               C is incorrect, because the slowing of sales of certain goods would likely
                               increase days of inventory on hand and, in turn, increase the issuer’s cash
                               conversion cycle.

                            2. Which of the following actions will most likely increase an issuer’s liquidity?
                                A. Forgoing a supplier’s discount for prompt payments
                                B. Relaxing terms for customers by lengthening the payment period

Introduction                                                                                   99


      C. Purchasing short-term marketable securities with cash on hand
     Solution:
     A is correct. Forgoing the discount is using the supplier’s financing and will
     result in the issuer stretching out payments on accounts payable, putting
     less drain on liquidity in the short run. This action increases the issuer’s cash
     conversion cycle.
     B is incorrect, because by relaxing credit terms, customers will take longer
     to pay, so this action increases the cash conversion cycle.
     C is incorrect, because marketable securities are generally less liquid than
     cash, so this action would reduce liquidity. Even if the marketable securi-
     ties are as liquid as cash (e.g., short-term Treasuries), this action would not
     materially affect liquidity.

  3. The Plough Corporation reports the following items on its two most recent
     balance sheets (in millions)
                                                   ​




                                                                    Fiscal Year-End

                                                  31 December 20X2          31 December 20X1

    Cash                                                       10                      15

    Prepaid expenses                                            5                       5

                                                   ​




     Based on the cash ratio, the company has:
      A. become less liquid.
      B. become more liquid.
      C. not changed regarding liquidity.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The cash ratios for the two fiscal year-ends are:
                               15 + 15      30
      	​Cash ratio, 20X1 = ​ _               _
                             120 + 60 ​  = ​  180 ​ = 0.1667​

                               10 + 20      30
      	​Cash ratio, 20X2 = ​ _               _
                             100 + 50 ​  = ​  150 ​ = 0.20​
     The cash ratio has increased from 0.1667 to 0.20, indicating an increase in
     liquidity.

  4. Which of the following events or activities is most likely to be a drag on
     liquidity?
      A. Inventory that becomes obsolete
      B. Making payments to suppliers earlier

                                 C. Offering a discount to customers who pay within 10 days
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. As inventory becomes obsolete, it becomes more challenging to
                                sell and inventory levels increase. This event is a drag on liquidity, because it
                                slows cash flows.
                                B is incorrect, because making payments to suppliers earlier is a pull on
                                liquidity.
                                C is incorrect, because offering a prompt-payment discount is likely to result
                                in cash receipts sooner, which would improve liquidity.

                             5. Which of the following actions provides a secondary source of liquidity?
                                 A. Issuance of equity securities
                                 B. Collecting accounts receivable
                                 C. Taking advantage of a supplier’s financing and paying on the net day,
                                    day 40
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand, borrowings,
                                and cash flow from operations. Secondary sources of liquidity generate
                                cash at a greater cost when primary sources are insufficient, such as issuing
                                equity.
                                B is incorrect, because collection of accounts receivable is a primary source
                                of liquidity.
                                C is incorrect, because supplier financing is a primary source of liquidity.

CASH CONVERSION CYCLE
                                                                                               2
              explain the cash conversion cycle and compare issuers’ cash
              conversion cycles

A company’s business operations are usually composed of several sequential steps.
For a company that makes and sells physical goods, its operations include acquiring
materials, producing inventory, selling products to customers, and collecting cash.
These activities are known as the issuer’s operating cycle and occur once or many
times over a year, as illustrated in Exhibit 1.



  Exhibit 1: Operating Cycle
                                     Collection



                        Customer
                                                          Cash
                         Credit




                                                                     Purchases
             Sales




                         Finished                         Raw
                          Goods                         Materials



                                       Production




These activities result in cash outflows and inflows that usually do not occur at the
same time as the activity. For example, materials are purchased and received by a firm
but may not be paid for in cash until weeks or months later. Goods are sold to cus-
tomers, but cash may not be received until weeks or months later. Finally, inventory
may take time to produce or be ready for sale, such as in the spirits industry, where
an aged product like whiskey can take years before it is ready to be sold to customers.
    Future cash inflows within the operating cycle are recorded as short-term assets
on issuers’ balance sheets, while future cash outflows within the operating cycle are
recorded as short-term liabilities. Issuers’ financial statements often use the terms and
associated definitions in Exhibit 2 for different types of future cash inflows and outflows.

                          These short-term assets and liabilities are recognized based on the performance or
                          occurrence of an activity and are derecognized when the cash inflow or outflow occurs,
                          as illustrated in Exhibit 3.

                          We can use the average duration of each of these short-term accounts to construct a
                          timeline for a company’s operating cycle. The amounts of time that accounts payable,
                          inventory, and accounts receivable are outstanding on the balance sheet are known,
                          respectively, as days payable outstanding (DPO), days of inventory on hand (DOH),
                          and days sales outstanding (DSO). The calculations of these amounts, known as
                          activity ratios, will be discussed in detail later in the curriculum. An important
                          quantity from this timeline for analysts is the cash conversion cycle: the amount of
                          time between an issuer’s paying its suppliers and receiving cash from customers (i.e.,
                          the time between derecognition of accounts payable and derecognition of accounts
                          receivable). Formally, the cash conversion cycle, in days, is expressed in Equation 1 as:
                              Cash conversion cycle
                              = Days of inventory on hand + Days sales outstanding − Days payable outstanding

                          Exhibit 4 depicts the cash conversion cycle on a timeline within the broader operating
                          cycle.

The cash conversion cycle is the number of days it takes a company to convert an
inventory investment into cash receipts from customers. Therefore, the longer the cash
conversion cycle, the longer a company needs financing to pay its bills, such as payroll,
because it has not yet received cash from customers. In 2020, the average US-listed
company had a cash conversion cycle of 78 days, though there was considerable vari-
ance by industry, as shown in Exhibit 5. Pharmaceutical manufacturers tend to have
relatively long cash conversion cycles because they keep a considerable inventory of
pharmaceuticals on hand. Airlines—a service business with minimal inventories of
goods and mostly prepaid sales to customers in cash or credit cards—tend to have
short cash conversion cycles.

The ideal scenario is a short or even negative cash conversion cycle, which means that
cash invested in inventory is quickly returned for subsequent investment. A negative
cash conversion cycle can result from receiving cash from customers before—in some
cases, well before—suppliers are paid. This scenario results in cash that can be used
elsewhere, reducing the need for alternative financing to fund operations.

                           INDITEX’S NEGATIVE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE

                             Industria de Diseño Textil, S.A., known as Inditex, is an apparel designer, manu-
                             facturer, and retailer listed on the stock exchanges of Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao,
                             and Valencia. Its largest brand concept is ZARA, which specializes in fast fashion.
                                 Inditex has a unique business model in apparel, in which it leverages its ver-
                             tically integrated supply chain to design, make, and sell numerous limited runs
                             of inventories, enabling it to keep up with and influence customers’ changing
                             fashion tastes. Inditex sells off-the-rack items directly to customers (who pay
                             with cash or credit cards), eschews stocking inventory to mitigate fashion risk,
                             and sources raw materials from a vast number of suppliers over whom it has
                             considerable leverage on payment terms. As a result, Inditex has a negative cash
                             conversion cycle, as shown in the table below.

                              Issuers can shorten their cash conversion cycle in several ways, including the
                          following:
                              ■   Reduce days of inventory on hand by discontinuing products or product
                                  lines with low or niche demand, by negotiating with suppliers to do more
                                  frequent deliveries in order to establish “just in time” inventory levels, and
                                  by using data analytics to improve customer demand forecasts and to ratio-
                                  nalize stocking levels.
                              ■   Reduce days sales outstanding by offering prompt-payment discounts to
                                  customers, imposing late fees, tightening credit standards, imposing upfront
                                  deposits or accelerating installment payments, and working with third-party
                                  collection agencies.
                              ■   Increase days payable outstanding by negotiating supplier contracts for
                                  longer terms. This approach may be feasible by establishing preferred
                                  suppliers—purchasing more in volume in exchange for better terms.
                                  However, it may result in suppliers charging higher prices or asking for
                                  deposits. The ability to lengthen days payable outstanding is highly depen-
                                  dent on the power dynamics between the company and its suppliers. If a
                                  company can purchase a critical component from only one supplier who
                                  sells to many others, it may not have the ability to negotiate better terms.
                              While extending days payable outstanding can improve the cash conversion cycle,
                          suppliers typically offer discounts for prompt payment, such as requiring payment in
                          30 days but offering a 2% discount if payment is received within 10 days. If a company
                          forgoes this discount in favor of paying in 30 days, it is implicitly borrowing from the

supplier for 30 − 10 = 20 days at the cost of the forgone discount. One strategy is to
borrow from a third party (e.g., a bank) at a relatively low interest rate, pay the sup-
plier early to receive the prompt-payment discount, and later repay the bank. Such
a strategy avoids the high cost of supplier financing but preserves cash, as shown in
the following example.

EXAMPLE 1

   Keown Corporation—Internal versus External Financing
   Keown Corporation is an established manufacturer of custom paddleboards
   operating in the North American market. Keown operates its own manufactur-
   ing plant in Canada and sells its paddleboards exclusively through its website to
   avoid the cost of retail locations.
       Most of Keown’s sales take place during the North American summer season
   from May to August. Keown’s customers expect orders to be filled immediately,
   so it must maintain substantial inventory to start the summer season or risk
   losing sales to competitors. Given the seasonality of the business, Keown is
   particularly focused on meeting customers’ needs.
       Since Keown lacks the necessary cash to pay its suppliers within 10 days,
   the CFO must decide whether to borrow from its bank at an effective annual
   rate (EAR) of 7.7% to take the prompt-payment discount offered by its supplier
   of materials or pay in 30 days. The terms from the supplier are 2/10, net 30.

   1. Should Keown use the bank loan and pay the supplier within 10 days to
      receive the 2% discount, or simply forgo the discount and pay the supplier in
      30 days?
      Solution:
      To compare the relative cost of the bank loan with that of the trade credit,
      we can calculate the effective annual rate on the trade credit. Essentially, we
      are calculating the interest rate on a loan for which the interest cost is the
      forgone discount and the term is the additional time Keown gets to pay; in
      this case, 30 − 10 = 20 days.

      ​Effective Annual Rate of Supplier Financing = 0.446 or 44.6%​
      Since the effective annual rate of 44.6% on the supplier financing is signifi-
      cantly higher than the 7.7% interest rate on the bank loan, Keown should
      borrow from its bank. That way, it will still be able to preserve cash but will
      pay a far lower interest rate on the financing.

    A long cash conversion cycle may reflect industry or business model character-
istics, but a longer cycle relative to competitors and a lengthening over time are of
particular concern for analysts. A longer cycle may signal worsening customer demand,
deteriorating customer financial health or credit quality, or the loss of bargaining
power with suppliers.

                             1. Which company has the shortest cash conversion cycle? The longest?
                                Solution:
                                Cash conversion cycle = DSO + DOH − DPO
                                 Cash conversion cycle for Walmart = 5 days + 48 days − 47 days = 6 days

                                 Cash conversion cycle for Target = 2 days + 68 days −75 days = −5 days

                                 Cash conversion cycle for Costco = 3 days + 29 days − 34 days = −2 days

                                 Cash conversion cycle for TJX = 7 days + 63 days − 47 days = 23 days

                                 Cash conversion cycle for Ross = 2 days + 61 days − 63 days = 0 days
                                Target has the shortest cash conversion cycle of the five companies.

                             2. These companies accept payment from customers at the point of sale in
                                either cash or a debit or credit card. Does this fact align with the activity
                                ratios presented?
                                Solution:
                                Yes, because days sales outstanding is small. Debit and credit card payments
                                typically settle in a couple of days, and cash sales are settled immediately.

                             3. In examining annual reports, you find that approximately 54% of Costco’s
                                sales are food or food-related items, a larger percentage than that of the
                                other companies, which sell a greater percentage of apparel and non-food
                                items. Does this fact align with the activity ratios presented?
                                Solution:
                                Yes. Companies like Costco that sell perishable goods tend to have a lower
                                number of days of inventory on hand, because inventory must be sold soon
                                after receiving it from suppliers or else it spoils.

                              In addition to the cash conversion cycle, another measure analysts use to assess
                          the efficiency of business operations is the amount of working capital used by the
                          firm, particularly its quantity relative to sales so that it can be compared across time
                          and firms. There are several definitions of working capital in practice. We distinguish
                          between total working capital, formally defined in Equation 2 as a broad measure,
                          and net working capital, defined in Equation 3 as a measure that excludes items
                          that are less related to the cash conversion cycle or business operations, such as cash,
                          marketable securities, and short-term debt.

To control for size and for comparability across firms, total or net working capital is
often expressed as a percentage of annual sales.
    Consider the information on Licht Vernieuwend N.V. for the fiscal year ending
31 December 20X2, as shown in Exhibit 6. The total working capital is the difference
between the current assets of EUR335 million and the current liabilities of EUR220
million, or EUR115 million. The net working capital excludes cash, marketable secu-
rities, and short-term bank loans from the calculation, giving a net working capital
of EUR225 million − EUR160 million = EUR65 million.

The cash conversion cycle and the ratio of working capital to sales are interrelated.
Since receivables and inventories are often large components of short-term assets and
payables are a large component of short-term liabilities, a short cash conversion cycle
is associated with a low ratio of working capital to sales and vice versa.

INDITEX’S NEGATIVE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE AND WORKING CAPITAL

   Continuing the earlier example, owing to Inditex’s business model—which
   includes prompt payment from customers for off-the-rack apparel, limited runs
   of inventories with fast turnover, and a vast number of suppliers over which it
   has leverage—Inditex has not only a negative cash conversion cycle but also
   negative net working capital and negative ratios of net working capital to sales,
   as shown in the table below.

                              A high ratio of working capital to sales may be a result of industry characteristics,
                          such as in the spirits industry, where inventory must age for several years before
                          being sold to customers, or in the pharmaceutical industry, where companies hold a
                          large amount of inventory, sometimes to comply with regulations. Besides cases of
                          necessity, as illustrated in Example 1, or cases of compliance with regulations, issuers
                          are generally better off holding less working capital and either using capital elsewhere
                          on higher-return projects or returning capital to investors.

      Issuer B has the longest cash conversion cycle, 50 days. By having the
      longest cycle, Issuer B is more reliant on alternative financing to support its
      operations relative to the other issuers.

   3. Assuming no change in days sales outstanding and days of inventory on
      hand, an issuer in need of cash flow that forgoes the discount offered by its
      vendor for payments within 10 days and chooses to pay on the due date in
      30 days is:
      A. shortening its cash conversion cycle.
      B. lengthening its cash conversion cycle.
       C. not affecting its cash conversion cycle.
      Solution:
      B is correct. The issuer that uses the vendor financing by delaying payments
      is increasing its days payable outstanding and thus lengthening its cash con-
      version cycle. The issuer is reducing its need for liquidity by taking advan-
      tage of the vendor financing at the cost of the forgone discount.

                                A is correct. The implicit financing cost that the issuer faces when forgoing
                                a discount that the supplier or vendor offers is based on the amount of the
                                forgone discount and length of the payment period beyond the discount
                                period; 1/10, net 50 would permit the issuer to borrow for 50 − 10 = 40 days

                             5. An issuer is comparing a bank loan at a rate of 15% with taking advantage
                                of a supplier’s terms of 1/14, net 30, paying on day 14. The best decision in
                                terms of the lower cost of financing is to:
                                 A. forgo the discount and use the supplier’s financing to pay on day 30.
                                 B. borrow from the bank to take advantage of the trade credit terms.
                                 C. use either option because the cost of the bank loan and the cost of the
                                     trade credit are identical.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct.
                                The cost of the supplier’s trade credit, expressed as an effective annual rate,
                                is 25.769%, which is higher than the 15% interest rate on the bank loan.

                                         explain liquidity and compare issuers’ liquidity levels

                          Liquidity for an individual asset or liability is its nearness to cash or settlement. Cash is
                          already cash, so it is the most liquid asset, while inventories can take issuers significant
                          time to sell and ultimately collect cash from customers and are thus less liquid than
                          cash. Similarly, accounts payable due to a supplier in five days are more liquid than a
                          lease payment due next month. Issuers report assets and liabilities on their balance
                          sheet in descending order of liquidity. Assets and liabilities that are not expected to
                          convert into cash or settle within 12 months are presented as long-term assets and
                          liabilities. Exhibit 7 depicts the relative liquidity of short-term assets and liabilities.

                          Liquidity for an issuer refers to its ability to meet its short-term liabilities. It is deter-
                          mined by the amounts and liquidity of its short-term assets and liabilities, which in
                          turn are determined by an issuer’s business model and cash conversion cycle. For
                          example, if an issuer has 20 in total short-term liabilities and 100 in cash, it is highly
                          liquid and will face no problem paying its short-term liabilities. If the reverse is true
                          and the company has 20 in cash and 100 in short-term liabilities, the company will
                          have to seek other sources of liquidity to meet its short-term liabilities.

Liquidity                                                                                             113



Primary Liquidity Sources
Primary sources of liquidity represent the most readily accessible cash available to
the company and include the following:
    ■    Cash and marketable securities on hand, which is cash available in bank
         accounts or held as currency or securities that could be sold quickly without
         significant loss of value.
    ■    Borrowings, from banks, bondholders, or suppliers’ trade credit. While this
         source can yield cash to settle near-term obligations, it creates another obli-
         gation that will need to be repaid in the future.
    ■    Cash flow from the business, though it takes time to generate, is a substantial
         source of liquidity for profitable firms. For example, if a firm has a liability of
         40 due in six months but expects to generate 100 in cash from its operations
         over the next six months, it will not have to use cash on hand or borrowings
         to settle this liability. However, firms in an earlier stage of growth or earning
         net losses may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet liabilities.
    While cash and securities on hand and borrowings are an important source
of liquidity in the short run, an issuer’s cash flow from its business is the primary
long-term source of liquidity. For that reason, financial analysts closely track this
information using a financial statement reported by issuers known as the statement
of cash flows, the basic elements of which are shown in Exhibit 8.

114   Learning Module 4                                                           Working Capital and Liquidity


                          There are several measures of cash flows that analysts use or calculate from the state-
                          ment of cash flows. Cash flow from operations is a cash profit measure over a period
                          for an issuer’s primary business activities, calculated as:
                              Cash received from customers
                              Plus: Interest and dividends received on financial investments
                              Minus: Cash paid to employees and suppliers
                              Minus: Taxes paid to governments
                              Minus: Interest paid to lenders
                              Cash flows from operations
                                                                                                                 (4)
                          However, this measure does not account for capital investments (covered in a subse-
                          quent learning module) that issuers make to improve operations or expand. Therefore,
                          analysts calculate an additional measure known as free cash flow that accounts for
                          this factor:
                              Cash flows from operations
                              Minus: Investments in long-term assets
                              Free cash flow
                                                                                                                 (5)
                          An alternative measure of free cash flow adds back interest paid to lenders in order to
                          compute cash flows that are available for both debt and equity investors. This important
                          topic will be addressed in greater detail later in the curriculum.


                          Secondary Liquidity Sources
                          While primary liquidity sources are preferable and are unlikely to affect a firm’s
                          ongoing operations, a secondary source may have to be used. Secondary sources of
                          liquidity include the following:
                              ■   Suspending or reducing dividends to shareholders.
                              ■   Delaying or reducing capital expenditures, which will preserve cash in the
                                  near term but may result in missed opportunities and impair long-term
                                  value.
                              ■   Issuing equity, by issuing shares in the public markets or privately to select
                                  investors. While equity issuance provides cash, it comes at the cost of dilu-
                                  tion for existing shareholders.
                              ■   Renegotiating contract terms, such as refinancing short-term debt to
                                  long-term debt; seeking concessions on interest, rent, and/or lease pay-
                                  ments; restructuring debt covenants; and renegotiating payment or delivery
                                  terms with customers and suppliers.
                              ■   Selling assets, which depends on the degree to which short-term and/or
                                  long-term assets can be liquidated and converted into cash without substan-
                                  tial loss in value.
                              ■   Filing for bankruptcy protection and reorganization to continue operations
                                  while restructuring debt contracts and possibly selling assets.
                              The use of secondary sources often signals a company’s deteriorating financial
                          health, as it seeks to increase its cash position at a relatively high price or disadvantage
                          to existing debt and equity holders, the company’s employees, and other stakeholders.
                          For example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines raised funds to shore up their
                          cash positions as revenue severely declined: Lufthansa raised EUR600 million through
                          a convertible bond offering, Singapore Airlines raised SGD$8.8 billion using a rights
                          issue, and Delta Airlines deferred USD500 million in capital expenditures.

    Example 3 shows the net proceeds from the primary and secondary sources of
liquidity for an issuer in a liquidity crisis. It also shows the liquidation costs incurred
by the company when those sources are used to raise funds. These costs can include
the fees and commissions involved with the asset sale as well as any discount in asset
value due to liquidity issues.

EXAMPLE 3

   Estimating Keown Corporation’s Cost of Liquidity

   1. Keown Corporation is facing a liquidity crisis. As an analyst, you have
      identified four potential actions that Keown could take to raise funds. Your
      estimates of fair value for Keown’s assets and liquidation costs are shown
      below.
                                               ​

    Source of Funds                                 lions of CAD)              (%)

    Sell short-term marketable securities                10                    0
    Sell select inventories and receivables              20                    10
    Sell excess real estate property                     50                    15
    Sell a subsidiary of the firm                        30                    20
                                               ​




      The liquidation costs include the fees and commissions for selling an asset
      as well as any reduction in value due to its illiquidity. In this case, liquidation
      costs for marketable securities are zero.

      Net of liquidation costs, how much liquidity can Keown raise if all four
      sources of funds are used, and what are Keown’s total liquidation costs?
       A. 110 million, 9.5 million
       B. 94.5 million, 15.5 million
       C. 125.5 million, 15.5 million
      Solution:
      The gross and net amounts of liquidity raised are summarized in this table:

      B is correct. Total net proceeds from the sales are CAD94.5 million, and the
      total liquidation costs incurred are CAD15.5 million.

116   Learning Module 4                                                           Working Capital and Liquidity



                          Factors Affecting Liquidity: Drags and Pulls
                          A company’s cash conversion cycle has significant effects on its liquidity position. Two
                          classifications for negative forces on a firm’s liquidity are drags and pulls on liquidity.
                          A drag on liquidity occurs when cash inflows lag, creating a shortfall due to a decline
                          in available funds. Alternatively, a pull on liquidity involves an acceleration of cash
                          outflows or a situation where trade credit availability is limited, requiring companies
                          to expend funds before they receive proceeds from sales that could offset the liability.
                              Major drags on receipts involve pressures from credit management and deterio-
                          ration in other assets and include the following:
                              ■   Uncollected receivables. The longer customer receipts are outstanding, the
                                  greater the chance they will not be collected. As we will see in the follow-
                                  ing lesson, this drag is often measured by the average number of days that
                                  receivables are outstanding as well as the level of customer payment delin-
                                  quencies as a percentage of receivables.
                              ■   Obsolete inventory. If inventory of finished goods is held for long periods, it
                                  might be an indication that it is no longer in demand by customers or can
                                  be sold only at a discounted price.
                              ■   Borrowing constraints. If credit conditions tighten due to adverse economic
                                  conditions, short-term debt becomes more expensive or unavailable.
                             In many cases, drags can be reduced by stricter enforcement of credit and collection
                          practices, but this approach may also drive sales lower if customers are unwilling or
                          unable to make a purchase if cash payment is required.
                             Managing cash outflows is of equal importance. If suppliers and other vendors
                          who offer credit terms have greater market power over a firm or believe its financial
                          position is weak, they might demand payment terms that strain the company’s liquidity.
                          Major pulls on liquidity include the following:
                              ■   Making payments early. By paying vendors, employees, or others before
                                  the due dates with no financial benefit, companies forgo the use of funds.
                                  Effective payment management means not making early payments.
                              ■   Reduced credit limits. If a company has a history of late payments, suppliers
                                  may cut the firm’s credit outstanding at any time.
                              ■   Limits on short-term lines of credit. If a company’s bank limits lending to it,
                                  the company may face liquidity constraints. Credit line restrictions can be
                                  government mandated, market related, or simply company specific.
                              ■   Low liquidity positions. Many companies face chronic liquidity shortages,
                                  often due to industry conditions or a weak financial position. This pull may
                                  be exacerbated by an aggressive approach to working capital management.
                             The following example addresses changes affecting Keown Corporation’s liquidity
                          position.

                           EXAMPLE 4

                             Drags and Pulls on Keown Corporation’s Liquidity

                             1. Keown Corporation is experiencing liquidity challenges. As an analyst, you
                                note three recent trends related to Keown’s working capital:

                                  1. An increase in average days sales outstanding is a drag on liquidity.
                                  2. An increase in days of inventory on hand is a drag on liquidity.

       3. An increase in credit limits by lenders is a pull on liquidity.

      Which trend does not contribute to the firm’s liquidity challenges?
       A. The change in average days sales outstanding
       B. The change in days of inventory on hand
       C. The change in credit limits
      Solution:
      C is correct. The increase in credit limits is not a pull on liquidity but is in
      fact the opposite: it provides liquidity.
      A is incorrect, because an increase in days sales outstanding is a drag on
      liquidity as it results in slower or delayed cash inflows.
      B is incorrect, because higher days of inventory on hand is a drag on liquidi-
      ty as it extends the cash conversion cycle.



Measuring and Evaluating Liquidity
The less liquid the company, the greater the risk it will experience financial distress
if business conditions change unfavorably. Financial analysts are keenly interested in
common measures to quantify and track changes in firm liquidity over time as well as
to compare issuers’ liquidity levels. To compare firms of different sizes with varying
sources and uses of liquidity, financial ratios are frequently used. Liquidity assessment
using financial ratios usually involves both liquidity ratios and the activity ratios intro-
duced earlier in Example 2. Exhibit 9 summarizes the three most used liquidity ratios.

118   Learning Module 4                                                           Working Capital and Liquidity


                          Liquidity ratios gauge a firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations from existing
                          current assets. The broadest measure of liquidity is the current ratio, or ratio of
                          current assets to current liabilities:
                                                      Current assets
                              	​Current ratio = ​ _____________
                                                    
                                                    
                                                  Current liabilities ​​	                                          (6)

                          Recall from an earlier lesson that we defined total working capital as the difference
                          between current assets and current liabilities. A firm with positive total working
                          capital would therefore have a current ratio greater than one, with a higher current
                          ratio representing greater liquidity under this aggregate measure, which includes all
                          short-term assets.
                              This broad ratio is usually considered together with two narrower liquidity mea-
                          sures that exclude less liquid short-term assets. Recall that, unlike cash or short-term
                          marketable securities, inventory and receivables are less readily convertible into cash.
                          The quick ratio is a ratio of short-term assets to short-term liabilities that excludes
                          inventory:
                                                  Cash + Short-term marketable instruments + Receivables
                              	​Quick ratio = ​ ________________________________________
                                                                 
                                                              Current liabilities ​​	                              (7)

                          A firm able to meet its short-term obligations without liquidating inventory would
                          therefore have a quick ratio greater than one. However, this scenario would require
                          the firm to collect all receivables without delays or customer delinquencies. The cash
                          ratio compares cash and short-term marketable securities with current liabilities and
                          is the most conservative of these measures:
                                                 Cash + Short-term marketable instruments
                                               ______________________________
                              	​Cash ratio = ​             
                                                        Current liabilities ​​	                                    (8)

                          A cash ratio equal to or greater than one indicates that a firm could satisfy all its
                          short-term obligations without having to wait to sell inventory or collect receivables.

   1. Has net working capital changed from 20X1 to 20X2? If so, what was the

      Solution:
      Net working capital is defined as:
       Current assets, excluding cash and marketable securities
       Minus: Current liabilities, excluding short-term and current debt
       Net Working Capital
      Licht Vernieuwend N.V.’s net working capital each year is equal to:

      Licht Vernieuwend N.V.’s net working capital has increased from EUR16
      million in 20X1 to EUR65 million in 20X2, largely owing to the increased
      investment in inventory from EUR66 million to EUR130 million.

                                        Based on the current ratio, Licht Vernieuwend N.V.’s liquidity has
                                        increased from 20X1 to 20X2.


                             3. Given the changes in liquidity ratios in Question 2, did the issuer become
                                more or less liquid based on the most conservative liquidity ratio?
                                Solution:
                                The most conservative liquidity ratio is the cash ratio, as it measures the
                                ability of an issuer to settle near-term obligations using only the most liquid
                                assets: cash and short-term marketable instruments. Based on the cash
                                ratio, Licht Vernieuwend N.V.’s liquidity has declined from 20X1 to 20X2.

   2. Consider the following information from the Statement of Cash Flows for
      the Lucor Corporation:
                                                   ​




            Net income                                                        1,000
            Cash flow from operations                                         1,400


            Cash flow from investing                                              (700)
            Investment in long-term assets                                        (800)



            Cash flow from financing                                              500
            Funds from debt issue                                                 600


            Total net cash flow for the period                                1,200
                                                   ​




      Lucor’s free cash flow for this period is closest to:
       A. 200.
       B. 600.
       C. 700.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Free cash flow is the difference between cash flow from opera-
      tions and the investment in long-term assets, or
      ​Free cash flow = 1, 400 − 800 = 600​

                                The denominator is the same for each of these ratios (current liabilities), so
                                the differences among these ratios are attributable to the numerator. In the
                                case of the cash ratio, the numerator is simply cash and short-term market-
                                able securities. In the case of the quick ratio, receivables are added to cash
                                and short-term marketable securities in the numerator. Finally, the current
                                ratio has all current assets in the numerator.

MANAGING WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY
                                                                                            4
              describe issuers’ objectives and compare methods for managing
              working capital and liquidity

The primary goal of working capital and liquidity management is to maximize firm
value while maintaining ready access to funds necessary for day-to-day operations
and obligations to creditors. Often, reaching this goal involves shortening the cash
conversion cycle, estimating required liquidity, and minimizing any excess so that
cash can be invested elsewhere in higher-return projects or returned to shareholders.
    The realistic bounds of working capital and liquidity management depend on a
firm’s business model. For example, some types of manufacturing may involve more
complex and lengthy conversion of inputs into finished goods, which may require that
inventory be held for weeks or months. A distributor of less complex goods, however,
may have just a few days of inventory on hand. Some businesses in the same industry
require more investment in inventory and receivables than others. For example, retail
businesses with multiple sales locations where finished goods are available for purchase,
as well as those that offer customers sales on credit versus immediate payment, will
need more working capital (in inventories and/or accounts receivable). In contrast,
service and software businesses may have far lower working capital requirements,
as they do not have inventories and may receive payments from customers upfront.


Working Capital Management
Firms estimate working capital requirements by first determining optimal working
capital requirements in relation to revenue and then forecasting future working capital
levels based on their revenue forecast. In doing so, firms often distinguish between,
on the one hand, base levels of inventory, staffing, and receivables that are permanent

                          current assets and relatively constant over time and, on the other hand, additional
                          inventory and labor needed during a company’s seasonal peak production and sales
                          period or during a growth phase that are considered variable current assets. During
                          this process, managers also weigh the cost versus benefit of different inventory and
                          receivables management policies. For example, higher inventory levels may reduce
                          the likelihood of a shortfall due to supplier risk or unanticipated demand but may also
                          increase the obsolescence risk of existing inventory. Although more accommodative
                          sales credit policies that increase receivables may help drive sales or revenue growth,
                          they may also lead to higher billing costs and increased payment delinquencies over
                          time.
                              Companies take different approaches to both the size of current assets and the
                          composition of financing used to support those assets. Exhibit 10 outlines three different
                          approaches to working capital management, from the highest cost (i.e., higher levels
                          of current assets funded on a longer-term basis) to the lowest (fewer assets funded
                          on a shorter-term basis) for a given level of sales.

                          sources. While this strategy provides a firm with the most financial flexibility to meet
                          its needs, it is also typically the costliest. The pros and cons of a conservative working

Firms in an early-growth phase are more likely to consider a conservative approach
due to limited access to short-term debt. More established companies with higher
profit margins pursuing such a policy may also be able to pass these higher financing
costs on to customers. Firms may choose to pursue a conservative working capital
strategy for a number of other reasons:
    ■   Reduced need to access capital during times of market stress
    ■   Expectation of flat to rising interest rates
    ■   Preference for cash flow stability over rollover risk of short-term debt
    ■   Benefits of greater certainty and access to more permanent capital, which
        are perceived to offset the higher associated financing cost
    An aggressive working capital approach, in contrast, seeks to minimize excess
cash, receivables, and inventory relative to sales, with more reliance on short-term
funding to meet variable and some permanent working capital needs. With fewer
committed resources to support current assets, the firm has reduced its short-term
financial flexibility in exchange for higher returns for investors.
    The pros and cons of an aggressive working capital strategy are outlined in Exhibit
12.

Firms in industries with lower profit margins may consider pursuing a more aggres-
sive working capital policy to gain a cost advantage over competitors. While greater
reliance on short-term financing lowers debt cost versus a conservative approach, a
firm also faces greater exposure to debt rollover risk in times of market stress. This
exposure affected many firms during the 2008–2009 financial crisis and in early 2020
during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                              Firms choosing an aggressive working capital policy may do so for one or more
                          of the following additional reasons:
                              ■   Ability to forecast future sales and cash needs with a high degree of
                                  precision
                              ■   Expectation of stable or falling interest rates
                              ■   Expectation that firm will shorten its cash conversion cycle (i.e., shorten its
                                  accounts receivable and inventory period and extend its accounts payable
                                  period)
                              ■   Ability to quickly liquidate inventory and minimize accounts receivable
                              A moderate working capital approach strikes a balance between the use of long-term
                          financing for more permanent current asset needs and short-term debt for variable
                          needs. Since stable, predictable needs are met with long-term financing and less
                          predictable seasonal or growth-based needs are met with short-term resources, this
                          method is often also referred to as a “matched” approach.

                          Under a moderate approach, firms face lower financing costs than under a more
                          conservative policy, with lower refinancing risk relative to a more aggressive work-
                          ing capital strategy. While these firms may also pursue measures to reduce working
                          capital and shorten their cash conversion cycle, the use of long-term debt and equity
                          to support permanent needs allows for more gradual changes in doing so. Other
                          reasons a firm might pursue a moderate approach to working capital management
                          include the following:
                              ■   Ability to accurately forecast base current asset requirements, with less
                                  certainty surrounding variable needs
                              ■   Reduced financing costs relative to a conservative approach, with lower roll-
                                  over risk and greater financial flexibility than a more aggressive approach
                              ■   To balance the use of less costly short-term financing with the stability and
                                  certainty of permanent working capital supported by long-term financing
                              The interaction between a firm’s sales strategy and its working capital approach is
                          an important consideration for financial analysts. For example, extending more credit,
                          or more generous credit terms, to customers in order to boost sales will also increase
                          working capital. In addition to an increase in accounts receivable, a firm may well face
                          rising customer payment delinquencies, both of which require additional financing.
                          The added cost of monitoring, billing, and collecting receivables over a longer period,
                          as well as higher borrowing costs, must be weighed against the additional profit gen-

       B. The company would likely collect faster, reducing its receivables.
       C. The company would have an increased need for working capital.
       D. The company could pay its suppliers sooner, reducing its accounts
          payable.
        E. The company would not see any change in working capital needs as a
           result of the change.
       Solution:
       C is correct. The company would likely need more short-term funding to
       support the expected increase in required inventory and accounts receivable
       resulting from an increase in sales.



Liquidity and Short-Term Funding
As described in a prior lesson, liquidity involves a firm’s relative ability to convert
resources into cash to meet immediate obligations. For most firms, this ability includes
using existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, or borrowings. Firms can max-
imize financial flexibility by developing a short-term financing strategy and regularly
evaluating available alternatives to fund themselves. Companies that fail to sufficiently
explore available options or to take advantage of cost savings from available forms of
financing are more likely to face higher financing costs or even financial distress, in
which they are unable to borrow from any source.
    A prudent short-term financing strategy (when to borrow and in what form)
achieves several objectives, including the following:
   ■    Maintaining sufficient and diversified sources of credit to fund ongoing cash
        needs. While many firms have a primary source of short-term funding, such
        as trade credits and credit facilities, a company should ideally ensure it has
        additional sources of financing available to reduce reliance on one lender or
        type of funding.
   ■    Securing adequate funding capacity to handle the firm’s changing cash
        needs. This objective may involve accommodation of peak seasonal needs or
        planned growth.
   ■    Confirming that financing rates offered, as well as associated terms and con-
        ditions, are competitive and understanding how these rates might change
        under different capital markets and economic conditions.
   ■    Ensuring that both implicit (e.g., the cost of supplier financing discussed
        earlier) and explicit funding costs are considered in calculating the compa-
        ny’s effective cost of borrowing.

                              A firm’s industry, size, location, and other factors may also influence its approach
                          to short-term funding in the following ways:
                              ■   Size. A company’s size is an important determinant of available financing
                                  alternatives. For example, a small, privately held firm might be limited to
                                  short-term credit advances from a single bank, while very large firms are
                                  able to access short-term fixed-income markets, among other sources.
                                  Many funding alternatives involve either a minimum size or fixed costs,
                                  making them prohibitively expensive or unavailable for small and midsize
                                  companies.
                              ■   Creditworthiness. A firm’s creditworthiness determines not only whether a
                                  loan will be approved by a lender and the rate it will pay, but also whether
                                  the loan contains terms and conditions that restrict the firm’s operations.
                                  For example, a lender may impose borrowing conditions on a less credit-
                                  worthy firm that restrict its ability to sell or use its assets for different pur-
                                  poses. This topic will be covered in greater detail in later learning modules.
                              ■   Legal considerations. Some firms in emerging or frontier markets with less
                                  well-defined legal systems may have fewer funding alternatives from finan-
                                  cial intermediaries or financial markets than firms in developed economies.
                                  As a result, they may rely more heavily on trade credits from suppliers.
                              ■   Regulatory considerations. Several industries in developed markets are
                                  highly regulated. Firms in these industries, such as utilities or banks, may
                                  be restricted in both how much they can borrow and the type of borrowing
                                  they can access. In other instances, they may have access to unique sources
                                  of short-term funding unavailable to other firms. For example, financial
                                  institutions can borrow and lend central bank reserves with one another
                                  and can also directly access central bank funding. The funding of financial
                                  institutions will be addressed in detail later in the curriculum.
                              ■   Underlying assets. Depending on their business model, companies may have
                                  assets, such as inventory, that are considered attractive as collateral for
                                  secured short-term funding.
                              For firms of any size, industry, or location, proper planning enables a company
                          to manage its short-term debt needs more efficiently. For example, forecasting cash
                          positions over a cash conversion cycle and beyond can help firms reduce the likelihood
                          of financial distress under adverse market conditions. Matching the timing of debt
                          maturities to expected cash receipts and spacing debt maturities out over time can
                          also help reduce short-term funding risk.

                           CHOICES


                             1. Which of the following factors should a company consider when evaluating
                                short-term financing choices?
                                  A. The cost of the funds borrowed
                                  B. The flexibility offered by the source
                                  C. The ease with which the funds can be accessed
                                  D. Legal or regulatory constraints that might favor one source over
                                     another

      E. All of the above
     Solution:
     E is correct. The cost of funds for a company is the most obvious item to
     consider, but it may choose to borrow at a slightly higher cost after taking all
     the other items into consideration.



KNOWLEDGE CHECK: MEETING KEOWN CORPORATION’S SHORT-
TERM FINANCING NEEDS


  1. Keown Corporation has accounts payable of CAD2 million with terms of
     2/10, net 30 and accounts receivable of CAD2 million. In addition, the com-
     pany holds CAD5 million in marketable securities. Keown has a short-term
     need of CAD200,000 to meet payroll. Which of the following choices makes
     the most sense for raising the CAD200,000?
      A. The company should issue long-term debt.
      B. The company should issue common stock.
      C. The company should delay paying accounts payable and forgo the 2%
         discount.
      D. The company should sell accounts receivable at a 10% discount.
      E. The company should sell marketable securities at a 0.5% brokerage
         cost (ignore capital gains tax).
     Solution:
     E is correct.
     The options for raising CAD200,000 are summarized in this table.
                                           ​

    Source of Funds              Action                           %         CAD

    C. Accounts payable (2/10,   Delay CAD200,000 in pay-         2.0       4,000
    net 30)                      ment and forgo 2% discount
    D. Accounts receivable       Sell CAD222,222 in value         10.0     22,222
                                 at 10% discount to raise
                                 CAD200,000
    E. Marketable securities     Sell CAD200,000 in value         0.5       1,000
                                           ​




     Choosing C involves forgoing a 2% discount, which on CAD200,000
     amounts to a cost of CAD4,000. To net CAD200,000 using option D, the
     company would have to sell CAD222,222 of accounts receivable at a cost of
     CAD22,222. E appears to be the best choice. Marketable securities are liquid
     and can be easily sold for market value, less the relatively minor brokerage
     cost of CAD1,000.

                             2. A company has USD30 million of accounts payable, for which it could delay
                                payment to day 14, forgoing the 2% discount it would receive for paying
                                within ten days. The liquidation cost in millions of USD is closest to:
                                 A. 0.6.
                                 B. 6.1.
                                 C. 8.4.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The liquidation cost is the forgone 2% discount applied to the
                                USD30 million value of the accounts payable.
                                 Liquidation cost = USD 30 million × 0.02 = USD 0.6 million
                                B and C are incorrect, because they represent effective annual rates of the
                                forgone interest applied to the value of the accounts payable.

                             3. A company changed the credit terms it offers its customers from 1/10, net
                                30 to 1/15, net 30. The most likely effect of this change is:
                                 A. an increase in accounts receivable.
                                 B. no change in accounts receivable.

      C. a decrease in accounts receivable.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The company extended the discount period by 5 days and did
     not change the discount amount as a percentage of the sale price (1%). More
     generous credit terms for its customers will likely increase accounts receiv-
     able, because customers will take longer to pay even if they take the dis-
     count. In addition, the more attractive credit terms may result in increased
     accounts receivable due to increased sales.
     B and C are incorrect, because a more generous discount period will result
     in increased accounts receivable as customers will take longer to pay if they
     take advantage of the discount.

  4. Changing its accounts receivable policy to extend credit to customers with
     lower creditworthiness will most likely result in:
      A. a pull on liquidity.
      B. a drag on liquidity.
      C. no effect on liquidity.
     Solution:
     B is correct. By extending credit to customers with lower creditworthi-
     ness, the company is likely to experience more delinquent or uncollectible
     accounts and an increase in days sales outstanding, resulting in a drag on
     liquidity.
     A is incorrect, because a pull on liquidity would result from an acceleration
     of cash outflows. In this case, the change to the company’s credit policy has
     the effect of slowing cash inflows.
     C is incorrect, because the change in the company’s accounts receivable
     policy would likely increase its working capital needs due to having higher
     accounts receivable.

  5. The Lucor Corporation is seeking to raise liquidity and is evaluating two
     potential actions.

    Option 1    Selling accounts receivable to a financial intermediary at a 5% dis-
                count off their carrying value
    Option 2    Accelerating payments to suppliers to receive a 5% discount

     Which of the options would achieve Lucor’s objective?
      A. Option 1
      B. Option 2
      C. Neither, because they both incur liquidation costs
     Solution:
     A is correct. Option 1 would increase liquidity by converting a less liquid
     asset (accounts receivable) into cash immediately, albeit at a cost.
     B is incorrect, because Option 2 would decrease liquidity by accelerating
     cash outflows.
     C is incorrect, because Option 2 would decrease liquidity by accelerating
     cash outflows and would not incur liquidation costs.

                             40 will most likely experience:
                              A. a pull on its liquidity.

                              B. a drag on its liquidity.

                              C. no change in its liquidity.

                          2. Which of the following will most likely decrease an issuer’s cash conversion cycle?
                             An increase in its days:
                              A. sales outstanding.

                              B. of inventory on hand.

                              C. payable outstanding.

                              Which issuer is most liquid based on the quick ratio?
                              A. Issuer A

                          4. An analyst is evaluating an issuer’s liquidity and calculates a negative cash con-
                             version cycle for the issuer in the most recent fiscal year. This result is:
                              A. not feasible.

                              B. possible, because the issuer has sufficient cash and marketable securities on
                                 hand to support short-term needs.

                              C. possible, because the investment in inventory is returned quickly and the
                                 issuer takes advantage of vendor financing.

                          5. An issuer eliminated the prompt-payment discount it had offered to customers.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. By extending the net period, the issuer will likely see its accounts
                             receivable increase, lengthening its cash conversion cycle and producing a drag
                             on its liquidity.
                             A is incorrect, because the change will slow payments from customers (inflows)
                             rather than pull on liquidity in terms of outflows.
                             C is incorrect, because extending the net period will slow payments from cus-
                             tomers and produce a drag on liquidity.

                          2. C is correct. Increasing days payable outstanding would reduce the cash conver-
                             sion cycle, because payments to suppliers are delayed. Days payable outstanding
                             is subtracted from the sum of days sales outstanding and days of inventory on
                             hand to compute the cash conversion cycle.
                             A is incorrect, because an increase in days sales outstanding will increase the
                             issuer’s cash conversion cycle.
                             B is incorrect, because an increase in days of inventory on hand will increase the
                             issuer’s cash conversion cycle.

                          3. A is correct. The quick ratio is defined as:
                                               Cash + Short-term marketable instruments + Receivables
                              	​Quick ratio = ​ ________________________________________
                                                                 
                                                              Current liabilities ​​
                              The quick ratio for each issuer is:
                                                         100 + 20 + 300    420
                              	​Issuer A quick ratio = ​ ___________
                                                                           _
                                                           400 + 40 ​  = ​  440 ​ = 0.9545​

                                                         120 + 10 + 300    430
                              	​Issuer B quick ratio = ​ ___________
                                                                           _
                                                           500 + 20 ​  = ​  520 ​ = 0.8269​

                                                         50 + 20 + 200    270
                              	​Issuer C quick ratio = ​ _              _
                                                         300 + 0 ​  = ​  300 ​ = 0.9000​

                          4. C is correct. If days of inventory on hand is low, the accounts receivable collec-
                             tion period is short, and the issuer takes advantage of its vendors’ financing, a
                             negative cash conversion cycle is a possible result.
                             A is incorrect, because issuers may have a negative cash conversion cycle if days
                             payable outstanding is larger than the sum of days of inventory on hand and days
                             sales outstanding.
                             B is incorrect, because the amount of cash and marketable securities on hand
                             does not affect the company’s cash conversion cycle.

                          5. B is correct, because the elimination of the discount will likely result in custom-
                             ers paying later as there is no incentive to pay early without the discount. With
                             customers paying later, this action becomes a drag on liquidity.
                             A and C are incorrect, because customers likely paying later will reduce the issu-
                             er’s liquidity.

INTRODUCTION
The previous learning module described issuers’ short-term investments and financing
                                                                                        1
activities. In this module and the next, we turn our attention to issuers’ long-term
investment and financing activities. First, we explore the various forms of capital
investment and their purposes. We then discuss the investment decision-making
process and compare analytical approaches employed in that process. In the third
lesson, we describe principles of capital allocation and common pitfalls. While the
goals of both capital allocation and estimating expected investment returns are to
select the best choice among investment alternatives, a firm’s decision today may
influence future investment decisions, resulting in so-called real options, which are
discussed in the final lesson.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Companies make capital investments to maintain or expand
          operations. Capital investments can be grouped into four cate-
          gories based on their risk and return characteristics: (1) going concern
          projects, (2) regulatory/compliance projects, (3) expansion projects,
          and (4) other.
      ■   Capital allocation is a process undertaken by issuers’ management and
          board for evaluating investment opportunities based on their expected
          contribution to shareholder value, as well as other considerations,
          such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Although

                                     some projects might look profitable on an accounting or standalone
                                     basis, they might be uneconomical compared to alternatives or from
                                     an overall strategic perspective. Such projects should not be pursued,
                                     and capital should instead be returned to shareholders.
                                 ■   Net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are two
                                     tools used to evaluate individual investment projects. NPV estimates
                                     the increase in firm value from a project, while IRR is an estimate of
                                     the rate of return on a project, subject to certain assumptions, which
                                     can be compared to a hurdle rate.
                                 ■   Unlike NPV and IRR, return on invested capital (ROIC) is a compa-
                                     ny-wide measure and can be calculated using data available to inde-
                                     pendent analysts. ROIC is the rate of return an issuer earns over a
                                     period across all investments and can be compared to an investor’s
                                     required rate of return. Like NPV and IRR, ROIC is subject to limita-
                                     tions and assumptions.
                                 ■   Before investment projects are appraised on a quantitative basis, they
                                     should be modeled in accordance with certain principles, including
                                     measurement of cash flows on an after-tax basis, avoiding double
                                     counting, and including a project’s impact on the rest of the firm.
                                     Impacts can be positive, such as cost savings, or negative, such as the
                                     loss of sales from existing products.
                                 ■   Apart from deviations from these principles, capital allocation is addi-
                                     tionally prone to behavioral biases and cognitive errors. These pitfalls
                                     can be detected by a thorough analysis of a company’s financials on a
                                     historical and comparative basis, as well as an examination of corpo-
                                     rate governance and management renumeration policies.
                                 ■   Real options are like financial options in that they provide a right, not
                                     an obligation, for management to alter different aspects of capital proj-
                                     ects in the future. Those aspects include timing and size of a project,
                                     as well as flexibility with regard to future pricing policies or operating
                                     capacity.
                                 ■   The most common approach to evaluating projects with real options
                                     is to compare a project’s NPV before and after inclusion of an option’s
                                     value less the option’s cost. More advanced methods include decision
                                     trees and option pricing models, which require assumptions about the
                                     probability of future events.

  2. When calculating IRR, the interim cash flows are assumed to be reinvested
     and earn a rate of return rate that is:
      A. lower than IRR.
      B. the same as IRR.
      C. higher than IRR.
     Solution:
     B is correct. An important assumption of IRR is that it represents only the
     (geometric) rate of return on the investment if interim cash flows are rein-
     vested at the IRR.
     A is incorrect because if reinvestment rates are lower compared to IRR, the
     rate of return on the investment will be lower than the IRR.
     C is incorrect because if reinvestment rates are higher compared to IRR, the
     rate of return on the investment will be higher than the IRR.

                                When calculating ROIC, an independent analyst should add equity and
                                long-term liabilities to calculate average invested capital. ROIC, unlike
                                project NPV and IRR, can be calculated using data available to independent
                                investment analysts.

                             4. Explain why capital allocation decisions should not be based on accounting
                                measures such as earnings per share (EPS).
                                Solution:
                                Capital investments with a positive NPV can reduce rather than increase ac-
                                counting measures in the near term, while cost cutting and share buybacks,
                                in contrast, may have a positive effect on such measures. Basing investment
                                decisions on short-term accounting numbers can lead a company to choose
                                investments that are not in the long-run interests of its shareholders. Addi-
                                tionally, capital allocation should consider opportunity costs, such as by us-
                                ing a required rate of return for calculating NPV and an appropriate hurdle
                                rate for an IRR. Accounting profits do not consider opportunity costs.

                             5. The annual report of company XYZ contains the following disclosures:

                                 Disclosure 1: “XYZ’s management compensation is based on exceeding a
                                 target EPS growth rate.”

                                 Disclosure 2: “XYZ’s management does not change the required rate
                                 of return when evaluating capital projects based on whether they are
                                 financed by internal or external sources.”

                                 Disclosure 3: “When evaluating investment projects, XYZ prepares cash-
                                 flow projections based on inflation-adjusted cash flows and discounts
                                 them using real rates.”


                                Which of the disclosed policies does not conform to best practices regarding
                                capital allocation?
                                 A. Disclosure 1
                                 B. Disclosure 2
                                 C. Disclosure 3
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Positive-NPV investment projects can reduce, rather than
                                increase, EPS in the near term, even though they increase shareholder value.
                                Management compensation should incorporate a longer-term perspective
                                and a measure that better considers required rates of return, such as ROIC.
                                B is incorrect because internally generated capital, such as cash flow from
                                operations, is equity financing and it could be returned to equity inves-
                                tors as a dividend. Regardless of the financing source, management should
                                use appropriate risk-adjusted required rates of return to evaluate capital
                                investments.
                                C is incorrect because companies may perform analysis in either nominal or
                                real terms, but the approach to cash flows and the discount rate should be
                                consistent. That is, nominal cash flows should be discounted at a nominal
                                discount rate, and real (inflation-adjusted) cash flows should be discounted
                                at a real rate.

Capital Investments                                                                             139


   6. Explain what real options are and how they influence company value.
      Solution:
      Real options are similar to financial options, except that they deal with real,
      instead of financial, assets. Real options grant companies the right to make
      a decision (but do not impose an obligation) in the future that alters the
      value of capital investment decisions made today. Real options, by providing
      future decision-making flexibility to companies, can be an important piece
      of the value in many capital investments.




CAPITAL INVESTMENTS
                                                                                            2
              describe types of capital investments

Capital investments, also referred to as capital projects, are investments with a life
of one year or longer, which usually appear on the balance sheet as long-term assets.
Like most assets, capital investments are initially recorded at cost. The expenditure is
not recorded on the income statement; rather, a portion of the cost is recorded on the
income statement periodically as a non-cash depreciation or amortization expense
over the asset’s useful life. The result is that capital spending is “smoothed” over time
and aligned with the inflow of benefits from the investment. On the statement of cash
flows, cash capital spending is simply reported as incurred.
    In subsequent periods, capital investment assets are presented on the balance sheet
on a net basis: cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. As depreciation or
amortization is recorded over time and accumulates, this net value declines to zero or
a salvage value. The process is illustrated in Exhibit 1 and will be covered in greater
detail later in the curriculum.

                          A firm’s capital investment and allocation process are central to its success and therefore
                          important for analysts to understand. Capital investments describe a company’s pros-
                          pects best, providing insight into both the quality of management decisions and how
                          the company creates value. Note that capital investments are not limited to property,
                          equipment, and other tangible assets; increasingly, capital investments are in the form
                          of digital capabilities and other intangible assets. Regardless of the nature of the asset,
                          the principles in this learning module apply because we are focused on cash flows.
                               Four categories of capital investments and their potential uses are summarized in
                          Exhibit 2. These investments usually link to the business model of the firm and reflect
                          its strategic and competitive environment.

Going Concern Projects
Going concern projects, often known as maintenance capital expenditures, are
investments to continue the company’s current operations and maintain the existing
size of the business. Common going concern projects include replacing assets nearing
the end of their useful life, maintaining IT hardware and software, and continuous
improvements of existing facilities. For example, a company might replace data center
cooling units with newer, more efficient alternatives.
     These maintenance projects are relatively easy for management to evaluate since
they usually involve the replication of existing business operations. Projects aimed at
improving efficiencies typically involve comparing the upfront cost to the expected
periodic savings over time in the context of current operations. Typically, these proj-
ects are lower risk.
     To fund these projects, managers (and debt investors who provide the financing)
usually seek to match the term of incremental financing with the lifespan of new
assets. For example, a utility company may issue a 30-year bond to finance replacement
power generation equipment with an expected useful life of 30 years. This so-called
match funding approach reduces financing risk, because funding long-term assets
with shorter debt obligations introduces rollover risk, or uncertain financing cost or
availability during the project before the capital investment reaches the end of its
useful life. Similarly, a company that borrows for longer than necessary may either pay
a higher long-term rate of interest or face the cost of buying back debt in the future
that is no longer needed.
     Issuers are not required to disclose the amount of maintenance capital expenditures
or the composition of total capital expenditures generally. Analysts often estimate that
annual maintenance capital expenditure is equal to the amount of depreciation and
amortization expense reported on the income statement. The accuracy of this estimate
depends on how closely the expected useful life of assets approximates actual useful
life and whether the historical cost of an asset approximates its replacement cost; both
assumptions are likely to be more accurate for shorter-lived assets.

                          Regulatory Compliance Projects
                          Unlike projects based on management discretion, regulatory compliance projects are
                          required to meet rules and standards. For example, such projects may be driven by a
                          new law to reduce pollution or financial regulations requiring banks to monitor and
                          report transactions and balances to regulators.
                              Regulatory compliance projects often increase a firm’s expenses with no added
                          revenue but are required to avoid fines and/or to continue operations. However,
                          industry incumbents may find that such rules and standards serve as a barrier to
                          industry entry and therefore increase or protect their profitability. Also, when firms
                          work directly with regulators to develop these new standards, their timing and impact
                          may be tailored to best suit an industry’s ability to adapt while continuing operations.
                          Firms with greater financial flexibility may consider early adoption of new rules to
                          reduce business uncertainty going forward and gain a competitive edge versus their
                          peers. Moreover, such investments can attract new customers and are often considered
                          to create a strategic advantage.
                              As standards evolve, firms must decide whether the returns on an underlying
                          business remain attractive once additional regulatory costs are imposed. In some
                          cases, firms may be able to pass some or all of the additional regulatory costs from
                          these projects on to end users in the form of higher prices. In other cases, a firm
                          may decide that a business no longer meets its minimum return requirement (once
                          the costs of such projects are included) and it would be better off winding down or
                          ceasing certain affected operations altogether.

                           EXAMPLE 1

                             Complying with Anti-Money-Laundering Regulations
                             Danske Bank A/S (“Danske”), the largest financial institution in Denmark, is
                             subject to a large anti-money-laundering investigation after a report from a
                             whistle blower and audit letters from Group Internal Audit. Danske acknowl-
                             edged in a press release that “major deficiencies in controls and governance made
                             it possible to use Danske Bank’s branch in Estonia for criminal activities, such
                             as money laundering.”
                                 The examination of Danske’s anti-money-laundering policies resulted in the
                             resignation of its CEO, the closure of the Estonian branch, and the arrests of
                             multiple employees. Danske is also expected to pay fines of up to several billion
                             dollars to financial regulators in the United States, Denmark, and other European
                             countries. The scandal not only had an impact on Danske but also resulted in
                             increasing penalties for money laundering in Denmark.
                                 While regulatory compliance projects can be costly, they can prevent scan-
                             dals and losses from fines and legal proceedings that damage firms’ reputations.

                              Businesses seeking to grow often engage in capital projects to increase the scale
                          of existing business activities, expand their scope to new areas of operation, or enter
                          new areas. These expansion projects typically involve greater uncertainty, time, and
                          amounts of capital than going concern or regulatory compliance projects.

operations whose expansion projects are therefore usually largely financed by equity.
More established firms also spend heavily on expansion projects. For example, phar-
maceutical and energy exploration companies often invest over 10% of annual revenues
in pursuit of new medications and energy reserves, respectively. Similarly, technology
companies typically invest heavily in expansion projects initially to accelerate prod-
uct development cycles, maintain competitiveness, acquire customers and clients,
and stay ahead of rivals. Established firms with an existing track record of successful
expansion are more often able to use debt financing for such capital projects given
investor perception of lower associated risk.
    Capital investments are also usually necessary if an established firm decides to
extend its existing operations to adjacent products and services or expand to new
regions or markets. The expansion of business scope may take advantage of existing
capabilities to meet the needs of a different customer base. Unforeseen risks related
to increasing scope include the added complexity of managing multiple business lines
and facing new competitors. Investors and analysts often look to a firm’s competitive
position and past performance by peers in executing similar strategies when gauging
the likelihood of success.

   Sony Grows Gaming Business
   Sony Interactive Entertainment (“SIE”) is a global, leading video game and
   digital entertainment company owned by Japanese multinational conglomerate
   Sony. SIE conducts the research and development, production, and sales of both
   hardware and software for the PlayStation console.
        In January 2022, SIE announced it would acquire Bungie Inc. (“Bungie”) for
   $3.6 billion. Bungie is a US-based independent videogame developer and long-
   time partner of SIE that has created some of the videogame industry’s most
   highly acclaimed franchises, including Halo, Myth, and Destiny.
        In the press release, SIE summarized how the acquisition would expand its
   business: “This acquisition will give SIE access to Bungie’s world-class approach
   to live game services and technology expertise, furthering SIE’s vision to reach
   billions of players.”



New Lines of Business and Other Projects
A firm’s management may decide to invest in an activity completely outside or only
minimally related to its existing business. Usually seen as a special situation offering
unusual growth, investment, or innovation opportunities for a company’s business or
business model, these projects are likely to be the riskiest capital investments.
    Either these projects will have characteristics of a startup, such as investing capital
to explore a new technology or a business idea/model for sources of new business
growth, or the company will acquire a firm in a new industry or sector. Important risks
include the unforeseen challenges of an unfamiliar business and the risk of overpaying.

                             Kirin Holding (“Kirin”) is an integrated beverage producer and the second larg-
                             est brewer in Japan. Kirin’s top brands include both alcoholic beverages, such
                             as Kirin Ichiban and Honkirin, and soft drinks, such as Kirin Gogo-no-Kocha
                             and Nama-cha.
                                 In September 2019, Kirin invested ¥129 billion to become a top shareholder
                             of Fancl Corp. (“Fancl”), a Japanese cosmetics and dietary supplement maker.
                             Fancl has more than 25 years of experience as a pioneer in the supplement
                             market and is a market leader in foods with functional claims. Both companies
                             want to combine their research and development capabilities with their strong
                             brands to offer a wide range of products.

                              Analysts should carefully examine issuers’ overall level and trend of expansion
                          capital investment, as well as the segment and market if disclosed, to analyze growth
                          prospects, management priorities, and the rates of return on investment relative to
                          alternatives. The level and trend of expansion capital spending may be estimated
                          by subtracting maintenance (often estimated using depreciation and amortization
                          expense) from total capital expenditures.

  2. It is true that the capital allocation process:
      A. involves the use of significant proprietary, non-public information
         about a company.
      B. aims at identifying projects with the highest absolute non-risk-ad-
         justed rate of returns.
      C. uses less information compared to the process used to construct
         investment management portfolios.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The capital allocation process is the process used by a firm’s
     management and board to make capital investment based on both internal,
     non-public and public information. The process is substantially similar to
     those used by investors and analysts constructing investment management
     portfolios but occurs at a more granular level of detail and more in “real
     time” because insiders do not need to wait for quarterly earnings reports.
     B is incorrect because the capital allocation process is used by a firm’s
     management to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns, when compared to
     similarly risky investments.
     C is incorrect because the capital allocation process is more granular com-
     pared to the process used to construct investment management portfolios.
     The capital allocation process focuses on identifying profitable projects and
     utilizes proprietary information. The process used to construct investment
     portfolios involves public information and non-material, non-public infor-
     mation, often at the company and segment level.

  3. What type of capital allocation project will most likely be implemented even
     if it has a negative estimated NPV?
      A. New lines of business and other
      B. Expansion of existing business
      C. Regulatory or compliance
     Solution:
     C is correct. Regulatory compliance projects are required by third parties,
     such as government regulatory bodies, to meet rules and standards and to
     avoid fines or other legal consequences.
     A and B are incorrect because new lines of business and other as well as
     expansion of existing business projects are done at management’s discretion

                                         (ROIC), and contrast their use in capital allocation

                          Capital allocation is the process used by a firm’s management and board to make
                          capital investment and return decisions. Management seeks to deliver risk-adjusted
                          returns greater than what investors could earn on similarly risky investments else-
                          where. The process is substantially similar to those used by investors and analysts
                          constructing investment management portfolios but occurs at a more granular level
                          of detail. Rather than only investing in entire companies, issuers invest in projects
                          and utilize significant proprietary, non-public information.
                              Investors and analysts must judge whether an issuer will manage capital wisely over
                          the long term. To make that judgment, analysts should evaluate the issuer’s capital
                          allocation process and its adherence to first principles and, most importantly, assess
                          the issuer’s historical track record of capital allocation. The generic steps in the capital
                          allocation process are shown in Exhibit 3.

                                                                     Review




                              ■    Idea generation: While ideas may originate from anywhere, it is important
                                   that management has a strong understanding of the competitive environ-
                                   ment that the prospective investment is situated in, as well as the firm’s
                                   current operations, capabilities, and competitive position. Often, ideas
                                   come from managers engaged in the business and involve expanding scale
                                   and scope of existing activities or adjacent businesses. Executives may also
                                   engage external consultants for advice on idea generation. As will be dis-
                                   cussed later, capital spending tends to be highly correlated from year to year,
                                   indicating that prior-period ideas and plans weigh heavily.

Capital Allocation                                                                        147


    ■   Investment analysis: Following the generation of investment ideas, manag-
        ers forecast the amount, timing, duration, and volatility of an investment’s
        expected cash flows to estimate whether the investment is a wise use of
        capital.
    ■   Planning and prioritization: Management selects and prioritizes profitable
        investment opportunities that, when considered together, are the most
        value enhancing on a risk-adjusted return basis. Only investment candidates
        estimated to generate returns greater than investors’ opportunity cost (the
        returns they could earn elsewhere on similarly risky endeavors) should be
        pursued. Additionally, some projects that appear attractive in isolation may
        be less desirable when considered in the context of existing operations,
        other proposed projects, or constraints on financing.
    When value-creative investment opportunities are exhausted, managers should
return any remaining capital to shareholders. In this way, shareholders can redeploy
that capital elsewhere to earn their required rate of return.
    ■   Monitoring and post-investment review: This step involves monitoring the
        performance of the investment and related activities against projections and,
        often, making adjustments, such as increasing or decreasing investment lev-
        els (which will be discussed later as real options). This step is important for
        several reasons. First, it helps validate assumptions made in the capital allo-
        cation process, revealing systematic errors, such as overly optimistic fore-
        casts. Second, it helps enforce discipline in business operations by focusing
        management attention on bringing performance into alignment with projec-
        tions. Finally, it may produce ideas for future investments. Managers should
        seek to invest in profitable areas and scale down or dispose of assets in areas
        that generate suboptimal returns or may have greater value to other firms.
    Two of the most widely used analytical tools in the investment analysis step are
net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). These are applications
of time-value-of-money concepts. While an independent investment analyst does
not have access to the project-by-project information used by management in these
calculations, an analyst should understand the rationale behind them, their strengths,
and their limitations in practice (also, these tools are used elsewhere in investment
management, which will be covered later in the curriculum). Analysts have access to
highly aggregated consolidated financial statements, which they can use to calculate
and analyze return on invested capital (ROIC), a useful aggregate, rather than project,
return measure.


Net Present Value (NPV)
The NPV of an investment is the present value (in currency terms) of expected future
cash inflows less the investment’s costs (or cash outflows), as shown in Exhibit 4.

                             Gerhardt Corporation NPV

                             1. Assume that Gerhardt Corporation is considering a capital investment of
                                €50 million today that is expected to return after-tax cash flows of €16 mil-
                                lion per year for the next four years plus another €20 million in Year 5. If the
                                required rate of return is 10%, what is the NPV of this investment?
                                 Solution:
                                 Using Equation 1, we may solve for the NPV as follows:

                               NPV = − 50 + 63.136 = 13.136.
                                 Since this investment may be acquired today at a cost of €50 million, the
                                 company exchanges €50 million today for an investment worth €63.136
                                 million. The investment increases the present value of the firm’s wealth by a
                                 net amount of €13.136 million.
                                 This can also be solved in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets using the NPV
                                 function:

Capital Allocation                                                                           149


       =NPV(rate,value1,value2,…)
      where

   rate = Required rate of return

   value(s) = After-tax cash flows
      Note that the NPV function uses t = 1 for the first cash flow, not t = 0, and
      assumes cash flows are evenly spaced. Therefore, cash flows at t = 0 (in this
      case, –50) need to be subtracted or added outside the function. The proper
      argument here is

   = NPV(0.10, 16, 16, 16, 16, 20) – 50

   = 13.136.

   Because the NPV is the amount by which investors’ wealth increases from an
investment, the NPV decision rule is as follows:
         Invest if                           NPV ≥ 0.
         Do not invest if                    NPV < 0.

Positive-NPV investments increase the wealth of the shareholders, while a negative
NPV reduces wealth. In the rare event that NPV is zero, a project could be accepted
because it meets the required rate of return. However, because NPV analysis relies on
estimated future cash flows, a zero-NPV project leaves no room for error. While the
decision rule is straightforward, NPV is usually just one factor in capital allocation.
There may be competing projects, intangible considerations, and so on, that factor
into the decision. Therefore, NPV ≥ 0 can be viewed as a necessary but not sufficient
condition for making an investment.
    Many investments have unconventional cash flow patterns in which outflows may
occur not only at inception but also on future dates, as in Exhibit 5. An example of
this is an investment in additional capacity at a later stage.

Analysis of these types of investments is best handled using spreadsheet software, such
as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, manually, or using the XNPV function, which,
unlike the NPV function, does not assume evenly spaced periods and allows the user
to specify the timing of cash flows. This concept is illustrated in the following example.

                                  This problem can also be solved in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets using
                                  the XNPV function. The XNPV function syntax is as follows:

                                  where

                              dates = Date of each after-tax cash flow (for a problem like this without exact
                              dates, the dates are arbitrary; what matters is that they are accurately spaced)
                                  The function is most clearly specified by referencing cash flow and date

      Besides trial and error, the IRR function in Microsoft Excel and Google
      Sheets is a straightforward approach to solving this problem. The IRR func-
      tion syntax is
       =IRR(values,[guess])
      where

   values = After-tax cash flows

   [guess] = An optional user-specified guess for the IRR (the default is 10%)
      Importantly, like the NPV function, the IRR function assumes that cash
      flows are received or paid at the end of period and that each period is evenly
      spaced. Unlike the NPV function, it does not assume that the first cash flow
      is at t = 1, so the argument here is simply

     = IRR (–50, 16, 16, 16, 16, 20)

     = 0.1952, or 19.52%.

    The IRR decision rule is to invest if the IRR exceeds the required rate of return (r)
for a capital investment:
          Invest if                                             IRR ≥ r.
          Do not invest if                                      IRR < r.

For this reason, the required rate of return is often referred to as the hurdle rate.
If the IRR is equal to r, the project is theoretically acceptable because it meets the
required return with an NPV of zero. Since the IRR of 19.52% in our example exceeds
the hurdle rate of 10%, Gerhardt should invest.

                              An important attribute of IRR is that it will only equal an investor’s (geometric)
                          rate of return on an investment if interim cash flows are reinvested at the IRR; if rein-
                          vestment rates are in fact lower, the rate of return on the investment will be lower than
                          the IRR and vice versa. The NPV calculation instead assumes interim cash flows are
                          reinvested at r, the required rate of return, which is often more economically realistic.
                          Reinvestment rates and the implications therein will be explored in depth later in the
                          curriculum in fixed-income lessons.
                              For an investment for which the assumptions of end-of-period, evenly spaced cash
                          flows are inappropriate, the XIRR function in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets is
                          the proper tool, as in the following example.

                           EXAMPLE 7

                             1. Assume that Gerhardt Corporation is considering a capital investment of
                                €50 million today with the following estimated cash flow schedule over the
                                next five years (all amounts in millions of euros).
                                                                       ​

                                  What is the IRR of this investment, and should Gerhardt make the invest-
                                  ment if its required rate of return is 10%?
                                  Solution:
                                  This problem can be solved in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets using the
                                  XIRR function. The XIRR function syntax is as follows:
                                  =XIRR(values,dates,[guess])
                                  where

                              values = After-tax cash flows at each date

                              dates = Date of each after-tax cash flow (for a problem like this without exact
                              dates, the dates are arbitrary; what matters is that they are accurately spaced)

                              [guess] = An optional user-specified guess for the IRR (the default is 10%)
                                  The function is most clearly specified by referencing cash flow and date
                                  arrays that are aligned on a spreadsheet, as shown here:




                                  The IRR is 6.76%, which is below Gerhardt’s required rate of return of 10%,
                                  so it should not invest in this project.

                             An important limitation with IRR is that multiple IRRs exist if cash flow signs
                          (+/–) change more than once. We can illustrate this with the following simple example:

The IRR for this investment satisfies this equation:
                     5, 000             − 6, 000
   ​− 1, 000 + ​ _ )1

                 (            (     ​​ 1 + IRR ​​​  ​
Two values of IRR satisfy the equation: 100% and 200%, which are clearly quite differ-
ent. In such cases, where cash flow signs change more than once, NPV should be used
instead of IRR. Financial calculators and spreadsheet software will often misleadingly
return a single IRR solution, defaulting to the lowest value.

WHICH TO USE: NPV OR IRR?

   While NPV and IRR criteria usually indicate the same investment decision, in the
   case of mutually exclusive investment projects, a company could face a decision
   between one project with a larger NPV and another with a higher IRR. If the
   company can invest in only one project, which should it choose?
       The correct choice is the project with the higher NPV. While NPV shows the
   firm’s wealth increase in currency terms from a capital investment, the IRR solely
   indicates a project’s rate of return (subject to the IRR reinvestment assumption)
   rather than its size or the period over which the IRR is earned.
       Many practitioners find IRR easier to use than NPV. If the required return
   is 10%, for example, a project IRR of more than 10% is desirable, while an NPV
   amount in currency terms may be harder to interpret because the number needs
   to be in the context of firm size. As a practical matter, once a firm has the data
   to calculate the NPV, it is simple to also calculate the IRR. However, the most
   appropriate and theoretically sound criterion is the NPV.



Return on Invested Capital
Independent investment analysts do not have the necessary information to calcu-
late or audit management’s calculations of project NPVs or IRRs. Analysts of listed
companies have consolidated financial statements and, sometimes, segment-level
information, all of which are highly aggregated and include cash flows associated with
many projects. Return on invested capital, also known as return on capital employed
(ROCE), is a profitability measure for the total capital that management has invested,
shown as Equation 3. Typically, an annual after-tax profit measure is used, so ROIC
is measured per year.

                                Solution:
                                No. Although the company is profitable, the company’s ROIC is below the
                                investors’ required rate of return, so the investor should look to invest else-

Capital Allocation                                                                         155


        where. However, this is only a single historical year, and myriad other factors
        will have to be considered by the investor.

   ROIC has several practical benefits:
    ■    Unlike project NPV and IRR, it can be calculated using data available to
         independent investment analysts.
    ■    Unlike such measures as operating profit or operating profit margin (oper-
         ating profit as a percentage of sales), ROIC accounts for the capital needed
         to generate returns. The relationship between operating profit margin and
         ROIC can be illustrated by decomposing ROIC as follows:

                After‐tax operating profit
               __________________
   	​ROIC =  ​   
                 
               Average invested capital ​​

               After‐tax operating profit       Sales
              __________________ _________________
   	​ROIC = ​          
                     Sales  ​  × ​   
                                     
                                   Average invested capital ​​

    The term on the left is after-tax operating profit margin, and the term on the right
is a measure of capital or asset turnover—how much in annual sales the company’s
invested capital is generating. Therefore, there are two paths to a high or increasing
ROIC: profit margin and turnover. A high-margin company can earn a low ROIC if
turnover is low, and a low-margin company can earn an attractive ROIC if turnover
is high.
    ■    While NPV and IRR measures allow the comparison of individual projects
         within a firm, ROIC is an aggregate measure to gauge a firm’s ability to
         create value across all its investments. This is important because investors
         generally cannot invest in individual projects, only the company as a whole
         (some exceptions exist, such as leases and asset-backed securities, which
         will be discussed later in fixed-income modules).
    ■    ROIC can be compared to investors’ required rate of return. If an issuer’s
         ROIC is greater than the investors’ required rate of return over time, the
         issuer is creating value for investors. Conversely, if the ROIC is below the
         required rate of return, it is an indicator that investors would have been bet-
         ter off investing elsewhere; the issuer should take actions to improve turn-
         over or profit margins, dispose of investments in underperforming areas,
         return capital, or seek alternative areas of investment with greater returns.
    ■    Since ROIC measures the returns that an issuer earns on investing both
         debt and equity, it should be compared to a required rate of return for both
         its debt and equity investors. As discussed in prior lessons, equity is risk-
         ier than debt and therefore has a higher required return, so using solely a
         required return for equity investors would be an overestimate. In the next
         module, we will calculate a blended required rate of return as part of a
         broader discussion of financing.
   ROIC does have limitations and shortcomings:
    ■    ROIC, unlike NPV and IRR, is an accounting, not cash-based, measure.
         Operating profit and cash flows can differ materially, owing to the recog-
         nition of certain items and the difference between depreciation and capital
         expenditures.
    ■    ROIC is backward looking and can be volatile from year to year based on
         investment activity and business conditions, so examining trends and rates
         of change is essential. Profitable investments can sometimes take years to
         earn competitive returns.

                              ■    As a highly aggregated measure, ROIC may mask profitable or unprofitable
                                   areas of the issuer.
                              Analysts should also be aware that there is less consensus on the measurement of
                          ROIC than such measures as operating profit margin, particularly the denominator.
                          Many practitioners, for example, subtract some or all intangible assets and “excess”
                          cash from the denominator and may exclude certain long-term liabilities, such as pen-
                          sion and deferred tax liabilities that are not considered “invested capital.” Additional
                          calculation issues, which will be addressed later in the curriculum, include treatments
                          of “non-recurring” expenses, leased assets, and equity from non-controlling interests.

                           QUESTION SET


                             1. True or false. During the planning and prioritization step in the
                                capital allocation process, a firm’s management should accept any invest-
                                ment project with an estimated positive NPV.
                                  Solution:
                                  False. Some projects that appear attractive in isolation may be less desirable
                                  when considered in the context of existing operations, other proposed proj-
                                  ects, ESG factors, or financing constraints.

                             2. Which step in the capital allocation process most likely involves the calcula-
                                tion of NPV and IRR?
                                  A. Idea generation
                                  B. Investment analysis
                                   C. Planning and prioritization
                                  Solution:
                                  B is correct. The investment analysis step involves forecasting the amount,
                                  timing, duration, and volatility of an investment’s expected cash flows and
                                  subsequently using NPV and IRR to determine whether the investment will
                                  be a wise use of capital.
                                  A is incorrect because during the idea generation step, management gathers
                                  ideas and chooses the most promising ones for further analysis. However, in
                                  this early phase, no forecasts or profitability analysis involving NPV or IRR
                                  is conducted.
                                  C is incorrect because during the planning and prioritization step, manage-
                                  ment selects and prioritizes profitable investment opportunities that, when
                                  considered together, are the most value enhancing on a risk-adjusted return
                                  basis. This step occurs after NPV and IRR analysis.

                             3. Which of the following relationships is true?
                                  A. If IRR > Required rate of return, then NPV < 0.
                                  B. If IRR = Required rate of return, then NPV = 0.
                                   C. Required rate of return = Risk-free rate.
                                  Solution:
                                  B is correct. IRR is the required rate of return that makes an investment’s
                                  NPV equal to zero.
                                  A is incorrect because IRR is the required rate of return for which NPV =
                                  0. If IRR is greater than the required rate of return, then NPV of cash flows
                                  discounted at the required rate of return will be greater than zero, not less
                                  than zero.

Capital Allocation                                                                                                         157


      C is incorrect because when calculating NPV, expected cash flows should
      be discounted at the required rate of return to reflect investors’ opportunity
      cost for similarly risky projects, not a rate that ignores risk.

                                Solution:
                                The required rate of return is the discount rate that investors require given
                                the riskiness of the project or company and the rate of return available on
                                other similarly risky investments. Considering the business risk of both
                                companies, a government-owned company can be perceived as a lower-risk
                                issuer compared to a small technology company. Consequently, investors
                                would require less compensation for risk.

Capital Allocation Principles
While the analytical tools and investment decision criteria introduced in the prior
lesson are quantitative and straightforward, there is considerable latitude for errors
and misjudgment. To improve the decision-making process, key principles should be
followed when using these tools.
   ■   After-tax cash flows: Managers should evaluate capital allocation decisions
       based on after-tax cash flows rather than other profit- or accounting-based
       measures. Managers must reflect the impact of taxation on a project’s
       expected cash flows, specifically the tax benefits derived from non-cash
       deductions, such as depreciation and amortization.
   ■   Incremental cash flows only but examine broadly: Capital allocation analysis
       should ignore sunk costs, or those expenses that have already been incurred
       (or written off ), and include only incremental cash flows associated with a
       new investment as compared to without it. However, capital investments
       often have an impact on the rest of the firm, which may be positive or nega-
       tive. A positive effect might include cost savings with business activities that
       directly result from making the investment, while a negative effect might be
       the loss of sales from a similar product. Both are incremental cash flows, so
       they should be included in the analysis.
   ■   Timing of cash flows: The forecasted timing, duration, volatility, and change
       in the possible direction of the expected cash flows must be considered for
       a capital investment. Notice how the NPV and IRR can change when cash
       flows are moved from one period to another.



Capital Allocation Pitfalls
Despite adhering to the principles, capital allocation is challenging for most firms. We
divide common capital allocation pitfalls into cognitive errors and behavioral biases.
Cognitive errors include calculation and other mistakes, while behavioral biases include
errors in judgment and blind spots.

Cognitive Errors in Capital Allocation

   ■   Internal forecasting errors: Management may make errors in their fore-
       casts, which may be difficult to impossible for external analysts to iden-
       tify. However, if significant enough, the incorrect or flawed analysis will
       ultimately manifest itself in failed, or underperforming, investments.
       Forecasting errors include incorrect cost or required rates of return inputs.
       For example, overhead costs such as management time, information tech-
       nology support, financial systems, can be challenging to estimate. Finally,
       companies often fail to incorporate competitor responses into the analysis
       of a planned investment.
   ■   Ignoring costs of internal financing: The primary source of financing for
       investments by large corporate issuers is cash flows from operations (i.e.,
       not borrowing or issuing shares). Many management teams behave as if
       these internally generated funds are “free” but scarce and allocate them
       according to a budget that is closely tied to prior-period amounts. External
       financing from debt or equity issuance, however, is treated differently: It is
       used less often, typically only for larger investments, such as acquisitions,
       and treated as “expensive.” This is flawed logic. Internally generated capital,
       such as cash flow from operations, is equity financing because it could be
       returned to equity investors as a dividend. While it is not raised from equity

                                  investors by issuing shares, it is withheld from them, incurring their oppor-
                                  tunity cost nonetheless. Regardless of financing source, management should
                                  use appropriate risk-adjusted required rates of return to evaluate capital
                                  investments; those funded by internally generated funds do not automati-
                                  cally get a lower r.
                          This error is hard to detect and isolate from other errors and biases, but analysts should
                          inquire about management’s capital allocation process and how the source of financ-
                          ing influences investment decisions. If a company has an aversion to raising external
                          capital and to returning capital, management may potentially be affected by this.
                              ■   Inconsistent treatment of, or ignoring, inflation: Inflation affects capital allo-
                                  cation in several ways. The first is whether the investment analysis is done
                                  in nominal or in real terms. Nominal cash flows include inflation effects,
                                  whereas real cash flows are adjusted downward to remove the effect of infla-
                                  tion (or adjusted upward to remove the effect of deflation). Companies may
                                  perform analysis in either nominal or real terms, but the approach to cash
                                  flows and discount rate should be consistent. That is, nominal cash flows
                                  should be discounted at a nominal discount rate, and real cash flows should
                                  be discounted at a real rate.
                              Investment analysis embeds, explicitly or implicitly, expectations for inflation,
                          which probably does not affect all unit prices and unit costs uniformly. For example,
                          rising oil prices are obviously beneficial for oil producers, which sell their product at
                          a higher price. However, rising oil prices over longer time periods can be associated
                          with rising production and capital costs, eroding some of the benefit. Second, many oil
                          companies also own refining and chemical businesses, for which crude oil is the main
                          input. Profitability of those businesses tends to decline as crude prices rise. If actual
                          inflation differs from expected inflation, after-tax cash flows will be better or worse
                          than expected depending on how specific sales outputs or cost inputs are affected.

                          Behavioral Biases in Capital Allocation

                              ■   Inertia: In a study of more than 1,600 US listed companies, researchers from
                                  McKinsey found a 0.92 correlation between levels of capital investment in
                                  a business segment or unit from one year to the next.1 This is the result of
                                  management anchoring capital investment budgets to prior-year amounts.
                                  Analysts identify this bias by examining the level of capital investment in
                                  total, by segment, or by business line, if disclosed, and comparing it to the
                                  prior year and the return on investment. If capital investment each year is
                                  static or rising despite falling returns on investment, analyst should question
                                  the issuer’s justification for a capital investment and whether management
                                  should consider alternative uses.
                              ■   Basing investment decisions on accounting measures, such as EPS: Managers
                                  often have an incentive to increase accounting measures, such as earnings
                                  per share, net income, or return on equity. Many capital investments, even
                                  those with high NPVs, can reduce rather than increase these accounting
                                  results in the near term, while cost cutting and share buybacks, in contrast,
                                  may have a positive effect on such measures. Paying too much attention to
                                  short-run accounting numbers can lead a company to choose investments
                                  that are not in the long-run interests of its shareholders. Analysts may
                                  observe this behavior first by examining the direct financial incentives of
                                  management based on the structure and composition of their compensation.

Capital Allocation Principles and Pitfalls                                                 161


        Second, analysts can compare the level of capital spending to historical
        and peer levels to judge whether management has prioritized shorter-term,
        accounting-based measures. That said, lower capital investment may be a
        sign of limited investment opportunities, in which case allocating capital to
        alternative uses is a wise decision.
   ■    Pet project bias: Projects that receive preferential treatment, or so-called
        pet projects, are sometimes selected without thorough capital allocation
        analysis. In other cases, such analysis is conducted but overly optimistic
        projections are used to inflate the pet project’s profitability. Identifying pet
        projects is difficult, because financial statements are usually aggregated and
        such projects may not meet the threshold of materiality. Instead, analysts
        should evaluate the corporate governance structure for warning signs that
        increase the chances of misallocation of capital: controlled companies or
        significant ownership concentration by a single individual or group, weak
        oversight by the board of directors, and executive compensation that is not
        aligned with stakeholders’ interests.
   ■    Failure to consider investment alternatives or alternative scenarios: While
        investment idea generation is the first step in the capital allocation process,
        many viable alternatives are never even considered at some companies.
        Firms also often fail to consider different outcomes, which can and should
        be incorporated through breakeven, scenario, and simulation analyses. This
        error may stem from limited capital investment experience, such as not
        making divestitures or acquisitions, or no experience with a failed invest-
        ment. While failure is obviously undesirable, the lack of failure over time
        may reflect a management team that is not taking enough risk.


QUESTION SET


  1. True or false: Investment projects funded using internally generated
     funds (e.g., cash flow from operations) should be evaluated using a lower
     required rate of return as compared to projects funded using debt or share
     issuance.
       Solution:
       False. Ignoring the cost of internal financing is a common cognitive error.
       Internally generated capital, such as cash flow from operations, is equity
       financing because it could be returned to equity investors as a dividend or
       share repurchase. While internally generated capital is not raised from equi-
       ty investors by issuing shares, it is withheld from them, therefore incurring
       their opportunity cost. Regardless of financing source, management should
       use an appropriate risk-adjusted required rate of return to evaluate capital
       investments.

                                  and uses real discount rates to calculate the project’s NPV. In the second
                                  year of the project, the actual lithium carbonate price increased by 10%.

                                  True or false. Given that Tolonen has used inflation-adjusted cash flows
                                  and discount rates, the rise in lithium carbonate prices will not impact the
                                  project’s profitability.
                                  Solution:
                                  False. Even though Tolonen was consistent in using real cash flows and
                                  real rates while preparing the forecast, this fact does not make the project
                                  immune to changes in inflation. If actual inflation differs from expected in-
                                  flation, after-tax cash flows will be better or worse than expected, depending
                                  on how specific cost inputs are affected.

                                  A is correct. Inertia can be identified by examining the level of capital in-
                                  vestment in total, by segment, or by business line, if disclosed, and compar-
                                  ing it to the prior year and the return on investment. If capital investment
                                  each year is static or rising despite falling returns on investment, the analyst
                                  should question the issuer’s justification for a capital investment and wheth-
                                  er management should consider alternative uses. In the case of XYZ, we can
                                  observe that for segments A and B, ROIC is decreasing, but both segments
                                  are getting a higher capital allocation each year.
                                  B is incorrect because sunk cost is related to the capital allocation process in
                                  determining a potential project’s profitability. Sunk costs, or those expenses
                                  that have already been incurred, should be ignored when evaluating poten-
                                  tial projects.
                                  C is incorrect because a detailed view of individual investment projects
                                  undertaken by XYZ’s management is not provided. Identifying pet projects
                                  from outside the firm is difficult, because financial statements are aggregat-
                                  ed and such projects may not meet the threshold of materiality.

     Solution:
     To calculate NPV for this project, Bradshaw should first calculate after-tax
     cash flows and consider depreciation only to the extent that it is tax deduct-
     ible and reduces taxes, because it is non-cash. After-tax cash flows can be
     calculated by applying the following formula to all cash flows to be received
     in the future.

     The calculation of NPV is follows:
                              3.69               3.69               4.92

  5. Explain why some managers might reject projects that significantly increase
     shareholder value (i.e., have a high NPV).
     Solution:
     Managers may have an incentive to increase accounting profitability mea-
     sures, such as earnings per share, net income, or return on equity. Many
     capital investments, even those with high NPVs, can reduce rather than
     increase these measures in the near term, while cost cutting and share
     buybacks, in contrast, may have a positive effect on such measures. If this
     incentive is strong enough, management may forgo high-NPV projects in
     favor of actions that increase near-term earnings per share.




REAL OPTIONS
                                                                                                   5
               describe types of real options relevant to capital investments

The capital allocation process described earlier implied that firms make all capital
investment decisions for a project at inception, maintaining one course of action
throughout the life of a project. In practice, firms often have alternatives, known as
real options, that can alter the value of capital investments. That is, some capital
investment decisions are in fact a series of decisions; some are taken today, while

                          others can be postponed and will be based on future economic events or information.
                          Similar to financial options, such as derivatives, real options grant a firm the right,
                          but not the obligation, to take an action in the future. A company should only pursue
                          (or exercise) a real option if it is value enhancing.
                              Just as the value of a financial option depends on the future value of an underly-
                          ing asset, real options are contingent on future events for a company. Real options
                          offer flexibility to companies that can greatly enhance the NPV of companies’ capital
                          investments in one or more of the following forms:
                              ■   Timing option: Instead of investing now, the company can choose to delay
                                  its investing decision. In doing so, companies forgo near-term returns and
                                  hope to obtain improved information for the NPV of projects selected.
                                  Investments may be sequenced over time, so that investing in a project cre-
                                  ates the option to make future investments.
                              ■   Sizing option: An abandonment option allows a company to abandon
                                  the investment after it is undertaken if the financial results are disappoint-
                                  ing. At some future date, if the cash flow from abandoning an investment
                                  exceeds the present value of the cash flows from continuing the investment,
                                  the company should exercise the abandonment option. Conversely, if the
                                  company can make additional investments when future financial results are
                                  strong, the company has a growth option, or expansion option.
                              ■   Flexibility option: Companies may also benefit from operational flexibility
                                  other than abandonment or expansion once an investment is complete. For
                                  example, suppose a firm finds that demand for a product or service exceeds
                                  capacity. Management may be able to exercise a price-setting option. By
                                  increasing prices, the company could benefit from the excess demand, which
                                  it cannot do by increasing production. Alternatively, a firm may consider
                                  production flexibility options to alter production when demand differs
                                  from its forecast. For example, a firm may add overtime or extra shifts to
                                  increase production for a given capacity.
                              ■   Fundamental option: The entire value of an investment may depend on
                                  factors outside the firm’s control, such as the price of a commodity. For
                                  example, the value of an oil well or refinery investment is contingent on
                                  the price of oil. The value of a gold mine is contingent on the price of gold.
                                  If oil prices were low, a company likely would not choose to drill a well. If
                                  oil prices were high, it would go ahead and drill. Many R&D (research and
                                  development) projects are also very similar to such options.
                              Firms use several approaches in evaluating capital investments with these char-
                          acteristics, such as the following:
                              1. Investment analysis without considering options: If the NPV is positive
                                 without considering real options and the project involves real options that
                                 could increase its net present value, then the NPV represents a minimum
                                 return and the firm should make the investment.
                              2. Calculation of NPV with real options: Under this approach, the firm calcu-
                                 lates a project’s NPV based on expected cash flows and then subtracts the
                                 incremental cost of the real option and adds its associated value, as shown
                                 in Equation 4:

                              Project NPV = NPV (without options) – Option cost + Option value.              (4)

Real Options                                                                               165


   3. Decision trees and option pricing models: Either approach may be used by
      firms seeking to assess the value of a capital investment that involves future
      sequential decisions and alternative outcomes for a given investment. These
      models often assign a probability and expected timing to future outcomes,
      which are used to calculate the project’s NPV.
   To calculate the return on capital investments with or without real options, firms
must often assume an expected probability for future events. The following example
provides an illustration using a decision tree for evaluating the return on a capital
investment with and without real options.

  cash flows associated with each real option in the following decision tree.

                                alternative uses in the future are considered. Note that the cash flow calcu-

                                cific outcomes. That is, in the case of both the possible alternative product
                                launch and facility sale to another firm, the 30% probability of each of these
                                mutually exclusive outcomes given a product failure in Period 1 (40%) makes
                                the conditional probability of each event equal to 12% (= 0.4 × 0.3).

                           QUESTION SET


                             1. Which of the following statements about real options is true?
                                 A. Using option pricing models estimates an option’s value with the high-
                                    est accuracy.
                                 B. Real options allow companies to abandon an investment project if its
                                    profitability is poor.
                                 C. Real options would allow a refinery to hedge future prices of crude oil
                                    needed for production.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. An abandonment option is a type of real option, which allows a
                                company to abandon the investment after it is undertaken.
                                A is incorrect because even though real options can be priced using option
                                pricing models, the estimates require multiple unobservable inputs, such as
                                probabilities of events and timing of their occurrence. The complexity does
                                not necessarily improve accuracy.
                                C is incorrect because real options provide companies with flexibility
                                with regard to future decisions; however, they do not allow the hedging of
                                commodity prices. The risk of crude oil price changes can be hedged using
                                financial options, not real options.

  2. ScolarCorp is planning a market research campaign to gauge interest in a
     new type of product. If interest in the new product is high, the company will
     need to upgrade its existing production plant to allow for product manufac-
     turing. Alternatively, if interest is low, ScolarCorp will sell the plant for $90
     million. The required rate of return for the project is 7.5%. A ScolarCorp

                                 If the market research cost increases, for example, by 10 (to –40), the NPV
                                 of the entire project will decrease by the same amount. Given that initial

                                 If the plant sale price increases (either in Year 1 or Year 2), the NPV of the
                                 entire project will increase by a smaller amount, given that corresponding
                                 cash flow needs to be probability adjusted and discounted to T0.

                                 An increase in the required rate of return will decrease the NPV of the

                                country. The local government is working on a new environmental regu-
                                lation that introduces subsidies and tax breaks for investments related to
                                renewable energy. Once the new law is approved, XYZ could upgrade the
                                distribution center at lower cost. If the company decides to wait for the new
                                regulation to come into effect, it will have to bear project-related costs of
                                $1.8 million. XYZ’s finance team estimates that if the company waits, the
                                NPV of the project will be $9.7 million, compared to a current value of $8.9
                                million. Calculate option value.
                                Solution:
                                To determine option value, we need to compare the project value with and
                                without the option and additionally consider option cost.
                                 Project NPV (with option) = $9.7 million.

                                 Project NPV (without option) = $8.9 million.

                                 Option cost = $1.8 million.

                                 Project NPV (with option)
                                 = Project NPV (without option) – Option cost + Option value.

                              that could occur if either project is undertaken. Soroka presents the forecast in
                              Exhibit 1 and is asked to calculate IRR and NPV for both projects. Investors in
                              ABC have a required rate of return of 8%.

                              ABC’s management asks Soroka to consider in her forecast the impact of a
                              six-month delay in all future cash flows and estimate the impact of that event on
                              IRR and NPV.
                              After reviewing the forecast, ABC’s management asks Soroka to estimate ABC’s
                              ROIC for 20X2. ABC earned operating profit of $8,830, had an effective tax rate
                              of 22%, and reported the balance sheet in Exhibit 2.

   ABC’s management has an ROIC objective of at least 9.2% and asks Soroka for
   her recommendation about the projects.

1. When preparing the cash-flow forecasts for both projects, Soroka should include:
   A. only the cost of the market research.

   B. only the loss of revenue from existing products.

   C. both the market research cost and the loss of revenue from existing
      products.

2. With regard to Project A and Project B, which of the following is true?
   A. Both projects should be invested in according to the IRR decision rule.

   B. Both projects should be invested in according to the NPV decision rule.

   C. Only Project B should be invested in according to the IRR decision rule.

3. The most likely impact from the cash-flow timing considered by Soroka is that:
   A. both IRR and NPV would decrease.

   B. both IRR and NPV stay unchanged.

   C. only IRR would decrease but NPV would increase.

4. Based on ABC’s balance sheet presented in Exhibit 2, Soroka should calculate:
   A. average invested capital of $72,510 and ROIC of 9.50%.

   B. average invested capital of $80,720 and ROIC of 10.94%.

   C. average invested capital of $92,995 and ROIC of 9.50%.

5. Considering ABC management’s ROIC-based investment criterion and the IRR
   and NPV of both projects, Soroka should recommend to:
   A. reject both projects A and B.

   B. invest only in Project B because it has a higher NPV.

   C. invest only in Project A because has positive cash flow during all four years.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. Capital allocation analysis should include only incremental cash
                             flows associated with a new investment. The loss of revenue from existing prod-
                             ucts is an incremental negative effect that should be included in the analysis.
                             The market research costs in this case are a sunk cost because the research has
                             already been completed and therefore does not affect cash-flow estimates, no
                             matter whether ABC undertakes either of these projects or neither of them.

                          2. C is correct. The IRR decision rule is to invest if the IRR exceeds the required rate
                             of return or hurdle rate. Project B’s IRR is 8.97%, which exceeds the required rate
                             of return of 8%; however, Project A’s IRR is 7.04%, which is below the required
                             rate of return of 8%.
                             The NPV of both projects can be calculated as follows:
                                                                4.5                    6               6              5.5

                                                                                   4 ​ =  1.12.​

                              	​​IRR​  B​​  = 8.97%.​
                              A is incorrect because Project B’s IRR is 8.97%, which exceeds the required rate of
                              return of 8%; however, Project A’s IRR is 7.04%, which is below the required rate
                              of return of 8%. Consequently, only Project B meets the IRR decision rule.
                              B is incorrect because the NPV decision rule is to invest if the NPV is greater
                              than 0. Project B’s NPV is $1.12 million, while Project A’s NPV is –$0.38. Conse-
                              quently, only Project B meets the NPV decision rule.

                          3. A is correct. The forecasted timing of cash flow is an important factor affecting
                             both projects’ IRR and NPV. In the case of delaying all future cash flows from
                             both projects by six months, the result would be a lower IRR and a lower NPV.
                             Given that all future cash flows are to be received six months later, their present
                             value decreases; hence, the NPV and IRR of an entire project also decrease.
                             B is incorrect because when cash flows from the investment projects are delayed
                             by six months, both projects’ NPV and IRR would decrease, not stay unchanged.
                             C is incorrect because when cash flows from the investment projects are delayed
                             by six months, both project’s NPV and IRR would decrease.

                          4. A is correct. To calculate ROIC, we can use the following formula:

5. A is correct. ABC’s management aims to achieve a minimum ROIC above 9.20%,
   but the IRR of both projects fails to meet this investment criterion. Even though
   Project B has a positive NPV, if it were undertaken, it would reduce ROIC.
   B is incorrect because even though Project B’s NPV is $1.12 million (which
   increases ABC’s value to shareholders), its IRR is 8.97%, which is below the target
   ROIC of 9.20%. Consequently, if Project B was undertaken, it would lower ABC’s
   ROIC.
   C is incorrect because Project A’s IRR is below ABC management’s target ROIC
   of 9.2%. Additionally, Project A’s NPV is negative, so it decreases ABC’s share-
   holder value.

INTRODUCTION
Earlier lessons addressed a firm’s short-term activities and longer-term capital invest-
                                                                                              1
ment decisions. We now turn to the last part of the balance sheet: long-term debt
and equity financing, known as a firm’s capital structure. The first lesson introduces
the basic objective of most managers when choosing a capital structure: minimizing
the firm’s weighted-average cost of capital. The second lesson considers the internal
and external factors that influence a firm’s choice of—and investors’ willingness to
offer—debt versus equity financing. While capital structure seems like an important
decision for boards and managers, it is the present value of future cash flows, rather
than a firm’s capital structure, that primarily drives a firm’s value, a central insight in
the influential work of Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller. In the third lesson, we
explore the simplifying assumptions used by Modigliani and Miller to demonstrate
the irrelevance of capital structure to firm value, and then we relax these assumptions
to show the impact of both taxes and the cost of financial distress. In the final lesson,
we discuss optimal and target capital structures for issuers.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   An issuer’s cost of capital is composed of its cost of debt and
           equity, which are defined as its investors’ required rates of
           return on debt and equity financing. An issuer’s cost of capital is esti-
           mated using a weighted average of the costs of debt and equity, using

                                 ■   Issuers generally aim to minimize their weighted-average cost of
                                     capital and to match the duration of their assets and financing.
                                     Managements’ target capital structures are usually stated using book
                                     values or indirectly through financial leverage ratios, such as a max-
                                     imum ratio of debt or net debt to EBITDA or a minimum credit rating.
                                 ■   While management has some influence, the total amount and type
                                     of financing needed or the weights in the WACC calculation often
                                     depends on the issuer’s business model (e.g., capital intensive or capi-
                                     tal light) and on the company’s life cycle stage.
                                 ■   The component costs of debt and equity are determined by top-down
                                     factors, such as financial market and industry conditions, and by issu-
                                     er-specific factors, including the stability of revenues and operating
                                     and financial leverage.
                                 ■   Modigliani and Miller (MM) showed, under a restrictive set of
                                     assumptions including no taxes, that an issuer’s capital structure is
                                     irrelevant to firm value. MM relaxed the assumptions by considering
                                     corporate taxes, financial distress, and bankruptcy costs and showed
                                     that capital structure does matter, although far less than an issuer’s
                                     future cash flows, for firm value.
                                 ■   Under MM’s static trade-off theory of capital structure, the optimal
                                     capital structure occurs where the tax benefit of debt equals the finan-
                                     cial distress costs associated with debt.
                                 ■   The pecking order theory of capital structure is an alternative to the
                                     static theory and suggests that a firm will use internal financing as
                                     much as possible. If external financing is needed, the firm prefers
                                     private debt over public debt and will limit the use of equity financing
                                     if possible.



                           LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                             These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                             of understanding of this learning module.

                             1. In computing WACC, the cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt be-
                                cause the:
                                A. cost of debt is set by management.
                                B. distributions to shareholders are tax deductible.
                                 C. debt investors take less risk than equity investors.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Debt is less risky than equity because it has a priority, contrac-
                                tual claim on the firm’s cash flow. Additionally, some debt is secured with an
                                underlying asset. In contrast, equity is a residual claim.
                                A is incorrect because an issuer’s cost of debt, like its cost of equity, is deter-
                                mined by financial market participants.
                                B is incorrect because, generally, distributions to shareholders, such as
                                dividends, are not tax deductible while interest expense is tax deductible in
                                many jurisdictions.

                             2. Nutry, Inc., has a capital structure of 30% debt and 70% equity, and interest
                                expense is tax deductible. Debt investors require a before-tax return of 5%,

Introduction                                                                            177


     and equity investors’ required return is 10%. If the marginal corporate tax
     rate is 20%, the WACC is closest to:
      A. 5.9%.
      B. 8.2%.
      C. 8.5%.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Nutry’s WACC is calculated as follows:
      WACC = (Weighting of debt × Cost of debt) + (Weighting of equity × Cost of
      equity)

      = (0.3)(5%)(1 – 0.2) + (0.70)(10%) = 8.2%.
     Thus, the WACC for Nutry is 8.2%. The cost of debt is stated on an after-tax
     basis because interest expense is tax deductible in Nutry’s jurisdiction.

  3. The optimal capital structure is determined where the benefit of the debt tax
     shield is offset by the cost of financial distress under the:
      A. pecking order theory.
      B. free cash flow hypothesis.
      C. static trade-off theory of capital structure.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The static trade-off theory of capital structure incorporates
     both the value-enhancing effect of the tax shield and the value-reducing
     impact of the costs of financial distress. At the optimal level of debt, the
     financial distress cost equals the tax benefit of debt.
     The pecking order theory states that firms use internally generated funds
     first because there are no floatation costs or negative signals. If more funds
     are needed, firms issue debt and only as a last resort will they issue equity.
     There is no optimal capital structure.
     The free cash flow hypothesis argues that higher debt levels discipline man-
     agers by forcing them to manage the company efficiently and use cash wisely
     so the company can make its interest and principal payments.

  4. True or False: Managers cannot precisely estimate the optimal capital struc-
     ture, but they often establish a target capital structure. An issuer’s actual
     capital structure may differ from its target based on business and financial
     market conditions.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     A is correct. Since management cannot estimate the optimal capital struc-
     ture in practice, it instead sets a target capital structure. The actual capital
     structure may deviate from the target for several reasons. First, the firm may
     be able to issue debt at a favorable rate, so management takes advantage of
     these opportunities. Second, changing market values of the firm’s debt and
     equity may cause the firm’s actual capital structure to differ from its target.
     Transaction costs make it costly to constantly adjust to the changing market
     values.

                             5. The amount and type of financing needed or the weights in the WACC cal-
                                culation depend on the issuer’s:
                                 A. business model.
                                 B. financial leverage.
                                 C. proportion of fixed cost to total costs.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The amount and type of financing needed or the weights in the
                                WACC calculation depend on the business model and the stage in the com-
                                pany’s life cycle. Some businesses require large amounts of assets and are
                                capital intensive. Other business models require less assets and are capital
                                light.
                                B and C are incorrect because the proportion of fixed assets to total costs
                                (operating leverage) and financial leverage are issuer-specific factors that
                                influence the component costs of debt and equity.

                             6. Under Modigliani and Miller (MM), if one assumes no taxes and no finan-
                                cial distress cost, among other assumptions, the value of the company is:
                                 A. determined by its capital structure.
                                 B. determined solely by its expected future cash flows.
                                 C. set so the value of levered company is greater than that of the
                                    unlevered company.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. MM showed that under a set of restrictive assumptions, includ-
                                ing zero taxes, the firm’s value is unaffected by its financing mix or capital
                                structure. It is the firm’s cash flow that is the primary determinant of value.
                                If the market value of the company is not affected by its financing mix, then
                                the value of the levered firm is equal to the value of the unlevered firm.




              2           THE COST OF CAPITAL

                                        calculate and interpret the weighted-average cost of capital for a
                                        company

                          As discussed in prior lessons, issuers make capital investments that are expected
                          to have a return on investment greater than the required rate of return. An issuer’s
                          required rate of return on its capital investments is derived from its investors’ required
                          rates of return, adjusted for specific risks in the project. If the issuer has exhausted its
                          positive-NPV project opportunities, it should return capital to investors so they can
                          invest elsewhere and earn their required rate of return. Not doing so would destroy
                          value for investors.
                              For an issuer, its required rate of return is also known as its cost of capital. Since
                          issuers use both debt and equity, the cost of capital is composed of the cost of debt
                          and the cost of equity. As described in prior lessons, debt is less risky than equity
                          for investors because it is a priority, fixed claim on a firm’s cash flows while equity
                          is a residual claim of indeterminate length. Additionally, debt is sometimes secured
                          with an underlying asset that would be transferred to the debtholder in the event of

The Cost of Capital                                                                          179


default, further reducing risk for the debt investor. Therefore, debt investors have lower
required rates of return than equity investors because they take less risk; equivalently,
an issuer’s cost of debt is lower than its cost of equity financing.
    An issuer’s weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) blends its costs of debt
and equity to obtain a single cost of capital. The WACC, after adjusting for any
project-specific risks, is what issuers use as r in NPV analysis and as the hurdle rate
for IRR analysis.
    The calculation of WACC is shown in Equation 1:
    WACC = (Cost of debt × Weighting of debt) + (Cost of equity × Weighting of
    equity).
                                                                              (1)
The estimation of each component of Equation 1 will be covered in much greater
detail in lessons on fixed income and equity later in the curriculum. For now, note
the following observations.
    ■   The cost of debt for an issuer is debt investors’ required rate of return on
        debt financing. The interest rate on existing unsecured loans and bonds
        is typically a good starting point. However, if we want a forward-looking
        measure, meaning the interest rate on new debt raised to finance a new proj-
        ect, we might instead look to what interest rates similarly situated compa-
        nies have recently borrowed at. Additionally, in jurisdictions where interest
        expense is tax deductible, we reduce the nominal cost of debt by multiplying
        by (1 – Tax rate) to obtain an after-tax amount.
    ■   The weightings of debt and equity are either their market value proportions
        or target weights provided by management, which are typically on a book
        value basis. Market value weights are more commonly used because book
        values reflect historical prices of debt and equity, while investors’ opportu-
        nity costs are based on current market prices of debt and equity.
    ■   The cost of equity for an issuer is equity investors’ required rate of return.
        Unlike the cost of debt, we do not have a historical interest rate to observe
        as a starting point. We do know that the cost of equity is higher than the
        cost of debt because of equity’s riskiness and because distributions to share-
        holders are not tax deductible.
    One simplistic approach is to simply observe the historical returns on equities in
general—because perhaps equity investors are expecting a similar rate of return going
forward—and adjust that rate for the company-specific considerations we will discuss
in the next lesson, such as how stable a company’s cash flows are.
    One long-running broad market index of stocks has increased by a compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% from 1928 to 2021, so 10% is a starting estimate
for the cost of equity we’ll use for these lessons. Expected and required rates of return
for equity investors are rich topics that will be discussed in more detail later in the
curriculum.
    ■   If an issuer has additional types of financing with different risk and return
        characteristics from those of debt and equity—for example, preferred stock
        and non-controlling interests—the weighted-average after-tax cost of that
        financing needs to be added to Equation 1 as well.

                           KNOWLEDGE CHECK: COMPUTING WACC


                             1. Assume that ABC Corporation is financed with 40% debt and 60%
                                equity. Also assume that interest expense is tax deductible. ABC Corpora-
                                tion wishes to maintain these proportions as it raises new funds.

                                ABC’s debt investors’ required rate of return, measured before taxes, is 4%,
                                and its equity investors’ required rate of return is 10%. If the company’s mar-
                                ginal tax rate is 23%, what is ABC’s weighted-average cost of capital?
                                Solution:
                                ABC’s weighted-average cost of capital is 7.23%:
                                WACC = [(1 – Tax rate) × Pre-tax cost of debt × Weighting of debt] + (Cost of
                                equity × Weighting of equity).

                                WACC = [0.04 × (1 – 0.23) × 0.40] + (0.10 × 0.60).

                                WACC = 7.23%.



                           DISCUSSION

                             If ABC’s management maintains the company’s current mix of financing
                             (40% debt, 60% equity), what would happen to ABC’s weighted-average
                             cost of capital if its cost of debt decreases by 1%? If its cost of equity increases
                             by 1%? What about if the company’s tax rate changes? Write your responses on
                             this lesson’s discussion board on the LES.

                              As demonstrated in the prior module, capital investments increase firm value if their
                          returns exceed required rates of return. The prior module focused on the return on
                          investment as the main driver of value, but it is also clear that a lower required rate of
                          return would increase NPV, too, or at least provide a lower threshold for value-creative
                          investments. This forms the basis for one of the most common objectives for managers
                          in capital structure decisions, the mix of debt and equity financing: Choose whichever
                          one leads to the lowest WACC. However, the cost of debt and equity are not chosen
                          by management but, rather, are determined in financial markets by investors, so it is
                          a dynamic and non-trivial endeavor. The second objective of management in choosing
                          a capital structure is, where possible and economical, matching the liquidity or time
                          horizon with that of its capital investments.

                                return of 6%, and equity investors’ required return is 12%. If the marginal
                                corporate tax rate rises from 20% to 25%, the change in the WACC is closest
                                to:
                                A. –0.09%.
                                B. 0.09%.

The Cost of Capital                                                                    181


       C. 0.30%.
      Solution:
      A is correct. XYZ’s WACC at a tax rate of 20% is calculated as follows:
       WACC = (Weighting of debt × Cost of debt) + (Weighting of equity × Cost of
       equity)

       = (0.3)(6%)(1 – 0.2) + (0.70)(12%) = 9.84%.
      XYZ’s WACC at a tax rate of 25% is calculated as follows:
       WACC = (0.3)(6%)(1 – 0.25) +(0.70)(12%) = 9.75%.
      Thus, WACC declines by 0.09% as the after after-tax cost of debt declines
      from 4.8% to 4.5%.

   2. True or False: Since the cost of debt and equity are controlled by the firm,
      managers can lower the cost of capital for the firm by reduce reducing the
      cost of debt and equity used in their capital allocation process.
       A. True
       B. False
      Solution:
      B is correct. This statement is false because the costs of debt and equity are
      not selected by management but are determined in financial markets by
      investors, though they are influenced by management’s actions.

   Questions 3 and 4 relate to the following information:
     Company X has the following on the right-hand side of its balance sheet:
                                               ​




          Bonds $400,000
          Common stock (40,000 shares) $600,000
          Total liabilities and equity $1,000,000
                                               ​




      The price of Company X stock is currently $20 per share. The required return
   before tax on debt is 5%, and the required return on equity is 10%.

   3. In calculating WACC for Company X, the weight for debt using book values
      for the balance sheet components is likely to be ________________ than the
      weight for debt using market values for the balance sheet components.
       A. lower
       B. the same
       C. higher
      Solution:
      A is correct.
      The book value weights are computed as follows:
       Wd = $400,000/$1,000,000 = 0.40.

       We = $600,000/$1,000,000 = 0.60.
      The market value of equity is equal to $20 × 40,000 shares = $800,000.
      The market value weights are computed as follows:
       Wd = $400,000/$1,200,000 = 0.33.

                                We = $800,000/$1,200,000 = 0.67.
                                Thus, the book value weight for debt (0.40) is higher than the market value
                                weight (0.33).

                             4. If the marginal corporate tax rate is 20% and the stock price increases to
                                $25, the WACC for Company X is closest to:
                                A. 7.60%.
                                B. 8.26%.
                                 C. 8.55%.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct.
                                The book value weights are computed as follows:
                                Wd = $400,000/$1,000,000 = 0.40.

                                We = $600,000/$1,000,000 = 0.60.
                                The market value of equity is equal to $25 × 40,000 shares = $1,000,000.
                                The market value weights are computed as follows:
                                Wd = $400,000/$1,400,000 = 0.29.

                                We = $1,000,000/$1,400,000 = 0.71.
                                The appropriate weights for the WACC calculation are the market weights
                                Company X’s WACC, using the market weights, is calculated as follows:
                                WACC = (weighting of debt * cost of debt) + (weighting of equity * cost of
                                equity)

                                = (0.29) (5%)(1-0.2) +(0.71)(10%) = 8.26%

                                Shareholder value is increased by a higher return on investment and a capi-
                                tal structure that results in a lower WACC.

Issuers desire a capital structure that minimizes its weighted-average cost of capital
and generally matches the duration of its assets. The total amount and type of financ-
ing needed are generally determined by the issuer’s business model and its position
in the corporate life cycle. The costs of debt and equity are determined in financial
markets by top-down factors that affect debt and equity markets generally, as well
as investors’ assessments of issuer-specific risk factors, as summarized in Exhibit 1.

Determinants of the Amount and Type of Financing Needed
The total amount and type of financing needed (thus, the weightings in the WACC
calculation) generally depend on the issuer’s business model and its position in the
corporate life cycle.

Capital-Intensive Businesses
Some businesses require a lot of assets—for example, those in utilities; transportation;
real estate; some types of manufacturing, such as semiconductors; and natural resource
production. These are known as capital-intensive businesses. This need for lots of
assets is evident from low asset turnover (low sales-to-total-assets ratio), high capital
expenditures to sales, and high net-working-capital-to-sales ratios.
    While many businesses were once vertically integrated and more capital intensive,
many have separated into multiple, focused companies where the capital-intensive
business is separate from the customer-facing brand or service businesses. The busi-
nesses then have contractual rather than ownership relations. For example, Hilton
Worldwide, one of the world’s largest hotel companies, operates almost all its hotel
rooms through long-term franchise or management agreements, with the hotels
themselves owned by others. Similarly, NVIDIA designs and tests its products but
does not manufacture semiconductor wafers; that capital-intensive activity is instead
done by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung
Electronics Co. Ltd.

                           EXAMPLE 1

                             Leases as Debt Financing
                             Many business models require fungible and tangible assets, such as
                                  ■   office space,
                                  ■   data centers,
                                  ■   IT devices, such as PCs, phones, and tablets,
                                  ■   aircraft, and
                                  ■   automobiles.
                                 While companies could buy these assets for cash or borrow cash and buy
                             them, a more common approach is to lease them from a lessor, such as a bank
                             or specialized asset lessor—for example, AerCap Holdings N.V., which leases
                             over 1,000 aircraft to airlines.
                                 A lease is like a loan, but rather than receiving cash in exchange for interest
                             and principal payments, the borrower (lessee) receives an asset in exchange for
                             lease payments. Implicit in the lease is an interest rate that is often much lower
                             than what the lessee would have been lent cash for, because the leased asset is
                             collateral and because lessors are often large companies that can borrow cheaply.
                                 Another similar approach to financing fungible and tangible assets is through
                             secured debt. By using the asset as collateral for a loan or bond, the issuer may
                             be able to obtain a far lower cost of debt than on an unsecured basis. This is true
                             of a downtown office building but probably not for a highly specialized factory
                             in a remote location or a consumable asset that has little value to investors as
                             collateral.

                              The capital structures of some firms can be regulated by governments. For exam-
                          ple, banks must adhere to regulatory capital standards by maintaining a certain per-
                          centage of equity as a proportion of assets. Similarly, regulatory oversight of public
                          utility companies by local governments can influence their capital structures through
                          rules and regulations relating to setting pricing/rates. This generally increases WACC
                          because it results in higher equity financing.

                          “Capital-Light” Businesses
                          Some business models—notably in the technology sector, as well as service busi-
                          nesses that have shed their capital-intensive businesses—have low capital needs (i.e.,
                          high fixed asset turnover and/or low capital-expenditures-to-sales-ratios), known as
                          capital-light businesses, or asset-light businesses. Their assets might be primarily
                          composed of excess cash and some intangibles. This reflects several factors:
                              ■   They simply operate a network for others that own assets and thus do not
                                  need to seek financing for them from financial markets. For example, Uber
                                  and Airbnb operate global ridesharing and hospitality networks, respec-
                                  tively, that connect drivers and hosts who own the automobile and real
                                  estate assets with riders and guests. The companies earn commissions and
                                  fees from network users.
                              ■   The company may charge its customers upfront for services or have a very
                                  short or negative cash conversion cycle, thus obviating the need for external
                                  financing for working capital.

Factors Affecting Capital Structure                                                             185


    ■   The company may compensate employees and management primarily with
        stock, which the employees and management are happy to accept based on
        a rising stock price, again obviating the need for cash. This is technically a
        form of equity financing, but from employees rather than formal financial
        markets.
    ■   If the company is profitable from an early stage and is capital light, it may
        not need to raise significant external financing unless management intends
        to expand quickly.


Corporate Life Cycle
Besides the business model determining the amount of financing needed, a large deter-
minant of the type of financing (debt versus equity) used is based on the company’s life
cycle stage. Rather than a static capital structure, most firms have a capital structure
that changes over time. The framework in Exhibit 2 describes the relationship between
a company’s life cycle stage, its cash flow characteristics, and its ability to support debt.

Free Cash Flow          Negative               Rising                   Stable
Business Risk           High                   Medium                   Low

Debt Type               Convertible            Secured                  Unsecured




    As companies mature, business risk typically declines and a firm’s cash flows turn
positive and stabilize, allowing for greater use of debt financing on better terms and at
lower cost. Note that the framework considers free cash flow, which is net of capital
investment. Profitable, high-growth businesses may have negative free cash flow once
greater investments are considered. While the life cycle stages of a company often
mirror those of an industry, both startup and growth companies can often be found
in mature industries. Examples include restaurants and apparel, with new concepts,
formats, and fashions appearing regularly, as well as technology-driven disruption of
established industries, such as advertising (TikTok and Douyin), retail (Shopify), and

                          Early Stage/Startup

                              ■   Early in its life, a company requires funding to develop and launch its first
                                  product or service. Revenues are zero or minimal, and the risk of busi-
                                  ness failure is high. The uncertain prospects and negative free cash flow
                                  lead most startups to seek equity rather than debt financing. Many stock
                                  exchanges have minimum size and profitability requirements and costly
                                  regulatory requirements, so equity financing for startups is usually sourced
                                  from founders, employees, and venture capital investors rather than through
                                  an IPO.
                              ■   At this early stage, the only types of debt financing that might be available
                                  are leases and convertible debt. Leased assets commonly include office or
                                  retail real estate that can be leased at a low cost. Second, in some cases,
                                  startups may be able to raise convertible debt, or debt that offers inves-
                                  tors the right to convert the debt to equity in the future at a predetermined
                                  price, while usually deferring interest payments until maturity. Convertible
                                  debt and other instruments combining debt and equity features are covered
                                  later in the curriculum.


                          Growth

                              ■   As a company emerges from the startup stage, product demand may result
                                  in rising revenue and accelerating growth, but further investment is needed
                                  to support growth and build scale. This includes sales and marketing
                                  expenses, growth-related capital expenditures, and working capital. Free
                                  cash flow is still likely negative, but visibility is improving as the firm estab-
                                  lishes its customer and supplier base.
                              ■   As business risk declines and free cash flow improves, the business becomes
                                  more attractive to lenders. Many growth companies use debt conservatively
                                  to preserve operational and financial flexibility and minimize the risk of
                                  financial distress. Equity remains the predominant source of financing.


                          Mature Phase

                              ■   As a firm reaches maturity, revenue growth slows but also becomes more
                                  predictable. A mature firm usually generates reliable and positive free cash
                                  flow and likely has an established customer and supplier base. There is
                                  typically a decline or a deceleration in growth-related investment spend-
                                  ing. Consistent free cash flow allows the company to borrow more cheaply,
                                  which is usually more attractive than higher-cost equity.
                              ■   In practice, large, mature public companies commonly use significant
                                  debt in their capital structures, although many seek to maintain an
                                  investment-grade credit rating to preserve maximum financial flexibility and
                                  minimize the cost of debt. Mature companies may elect to distribute capital
                                  to shareholders by increasing dividends or repurchasing shares.



                          Determinants of the Costs of Debt and Equity
                          The costs of debt and equity are determined in financial markets by top-down factors
                          that affect debt and equity markets generally, as well as investors’ assessments of
                          issuer-specific factors. While the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity, these
                          costs are influenced by the same risk factors and thus tend to move together because
                          they are claims on the same cash flows.

Top-Down Factors
Top-down factors affecting the cost of capital include financial market conditions
and industry conditions.
    Economic conditions can significantly influence debt and equity investors’ expected
returns, whether in private or public markets. Debt investors can invest on a nearly
risk-free basis in sovereign government debt and will demand a spread over that as com-
pensation for assuming the issuer-specific risks. Macroeconomic and country-specific
factors (real growth, inflation, monetary policy, and exchange rate changes) can increase
both interest rates on sovereign governments debt and credit spreads across issuers.
As recession risk increases, debt investors may charge borrowers much higher spreads,
owing to the increasing possibility of default. This effect is often more pronounced
among firms in cyclical sectors, such as mining, materials, or industrials, in which
revenues and cash flows vary widely through the economic cycle. The same is true for
equity investors; companies ideally want to borrow when interest rates are low, and
they want to issue equity when stock prices are high. This tends to follow the same
conditions as when credit spreads are low.
    The industry in which a firm operates is likely to have a significant effect as well.
Exposure to economic factors is generally based on the products or services the issuer
sells. For example, higher oil prices might lead to lower credit spreads and greater
investor willingness to increase financial leverage for oil producers, while the opposite
may happen for airlines, for which fuel is a significant expense.

Issuer-Specific Factors
Debt and equity investors consider the risk and return profile of an issuer and adjust
their required rates of return relative to base rates or broad averages by evaluating
risk factors, including the following:
   1. Sales risks
   2. Profitability risks (operating leverage)
   3. Financial leverage and interest coverage
   4. Collateral/type of assets owned by the firm.
    Investors are more confident, all else equal, in firms with stable, predictable,
and growing revenues and so will extend financing at lower costs to these types of
firms. This is generally the result of size and the characteristics of the firm’s products
and services. For example, established firms in the telecommunications or software
industries have stable cash flow streams from recurring subscription-based revenues
from many customers, so no single customer represents more than a small fraction of
total revenues. In contrast, such industries as automobile and construction equipment
manufacturing have more volatile cash flows that are highly sensitive to economic
conditions, increasing the risk of default should business conditions worsen.
    Besides stability of revenues, stability of profit margins is also an important factor,
which is determined by a company’s proportion of fixed versus variable costs. This
is often measured using a firm’s operating leverage, or its proportion of fixed costs
to total costs:
   Operating leverage = Fixed costs/Total costs.                                     (2)
Companies with higher operating leverage experience a greater change in cash flow
and profitability for a given change in revenue than firms with low operating leverage,
as shown in the following example.

                             Consider two companies fully financed by equity. Each firm has revenue
                             of 100 over a particular period and expenses of 70.
                                 ■     The first company (FirmFC+) has fixed costs (FC) of 50 and variable
                                       costs (VC) equal to 20% of sales, or 20.
                                 ■     The second company (FirmFC–) has fixed costs of 20 and variable costs
                                       equal to 50% of sales.

  4. Which firm might debt investors be willing to extend credit to at a lower
     cost of debt? Explain your answer.
     Solution:
     Based on the information provided, debt investors might be willing to
     extend credit at a lower cost of debt to FirmFC– because its profits and prof-
     itability are more stable, especially in the downside case of a 25% decline in
     sales. The firm’s stability of profits makes it more likely than FirmFC+ to be
     able to make promised interest and principal payments even if sales decline.
     The stability of profits results from a higher percentage of costs that are vari-
     able; in other words, it has lower operating leverage.
     In practice, debt investors would, among other things, evaluate the stabil-
     ity of sales and develop an outlook for sales growth for both firms. While
     FirmFC– has lower operating leverage, it could have greater sales risk than
     FirmFC+.

    Financial leverage and interest coverage are important considerations because a
company with significant indebtedness already is less able to support incremental debt
because it has already committed to interest and principal payments. Additionally, for
equity investors, high levels of indebtedness mean that there are significant priority
claims ahead of them. Financial leverage, covered in a prior lesson, is often measured

  4. Which firm might investors require lower rates of return for on debt and
     equity? Explain your answer.
     Solution:
     Firm A, which is primarily financed with equity. While Firm B has greater
     profitability (ROE) in the base case and higher upside for equity investors if
     operating income increases, it has a much wider range of outcomes owing
     to its substantially higher leverage. Even in the downside case, Firm A’s
     interest coverage ratio is over 10; therefore, it can withstand a >90% decline
     in operating income before its ability to make interest payments is seriously
     imperiled.
     In practice, investors would, among other things, evaluate the stability of
     sales and operating leverage in developing an outlook for both firms. So
     while Firm A has lower financial leverage and higher interest coverage, it
     could have greater operating leverage and higher sales risk than Firm B.

                          such as real estate, automobiles, aircraft, and receivables from creditworthy customers.

                                the debt type:
                                                                      ​

                                   A. Startup                              i. Unsecured

                                                                      ​




                                Solution:

                                A. ii. Convertible: In the early stages of the corporate life cycle, the only
                                   types of debt available are leases and convertible debt.
                                B. iii. Secured: Business risk declines and free cash flow improves in the
                                   growth phase but is still likely negative, so secured debt financing is
                                   most likely.
                                C. i. Unsecured: Free cash is now positive and predictable. The firm is
                                   able to use a significant amount of debt, including unsecured debt.

                             2. The cost of debt and equity is likely to be higher for a firm with
                                A. stable revenue growth.
                                B. high operating leverage.
                                 C. high interest coverage.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Operating leverage is the firm’s proportion of fixed costs to
                                total costs and measures the stability of profits. Firms with high operating
                                leverage experience a greater change in operating profits for a given change
                                in revenues. Thus, firms with high operating margins are riskier and likely to
                                have higher debt and equity costs.
                                A and C are incorrect. Stable revenue growth and high interest coverage
                                suggest a lower risk profile for the firm and a lower cost of debt and equity.
                                A high interest coverage ratio indicates the firm has lower financial leverage
                                and less risk.

                             Jason Jayman, a financial analyst, is preparing a report on two companies.
                             Newtech is an early-stage company with a primarily variable operating cost
                             structure, and its assets are largely cash and intangibles. Oldtech is a mature
                             company with high fixed costs, low capital turnover, and a high capital expen-
                             diture to sales ratio. Jayman expects GDP growth to slow over the next year,
                             which will lower the growth rate of revenues for both companies.

                             3. Newtech will likely finance activity by issuing:
                                A. unsecured debt.
                                B. equity through an IPO.

       C. equity sourced from founders and employees.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Newtech is in the early stages of its corporate life cycle. Equity
      financing for early-stage firms is sourced from founders, employees through
      share-based compensation, and venture capital. Generally, the only sources
      of debt financing available for these firms are leases and convertible debt.
      Equity financing through an IPO is unlikely given that most stock exchanges
      have minimum size and profitability requirements.

   4. Given the forecast of deteriorating business conditions, which company will
      experience a greater change in cash flow and profitability?
      A. Newtech
      B. No difference
       C. Oldtech
      Solution:
      C. is correct. With revenue growth slowing, Oldtech is likely to experience
      a greater change in cash flow and profitability. Despite being in the mature
      phase of the corporate life cycle, during which one would expect stable prof-
      its, Oldtech has high operating leverage given its high degree of fixed cost.
      This will result in a greater change in profits for a given change in revenues.
      In contrast, Newtech’s costs are variable, with low operating leverage.

   5. The business model used by Oldtech can best be described as:
      A. capital light.
      B. capital intensive.
       C. contractual rather than ownership relationships.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Oldtech’s business model can best be described as capital
      intensive given its high fixed costs, low capital turnover, and high capital-ex-
      penditure-to-sales ratio. The firm requires a lot of assets and has significant
      financing requirements. Newtech is capital light since most of its costs are
      variable and its assets are largely cash and intangibles.




MODIGLIANI–MILLER CAPITAL STRUCTURE
PROPOSITIONS                                                                                4
              explain the Modigliani–Miller propositions regarding capital
              structure

In a classic 1958 paper, Nobel Prize–winning economists Franco Modigliani and
Merton Miller argued that under certain assumptions, a company’s choice of capital
structure does not affect (or is “irrelevant” in determining) its value, where firm value
is equal to the present value of the firm’s expected future cash flows, discounted by
its weighted-average cost of capital. In short, managers cannot change a company’s
value by simply changing its capital structure. The assumptions used by Modigliani
and Miller (MM) are shown in Exhibit 3.

                          relatively modest in practice. While their assumptions do not hold in practice—which
                          ultimately does alter MM’s original conclusion of capital structure irrelevance—their
                          theoretical framework remains a popular starting point for considering the use of debt
                          in a company’s capital structure. What is clear is that it’s a firm’s future cash flows
                          that are the primary driver of value, not capital structure.


                          Capital Structure Irrelevance (MM Proposition I without Taxes)
                          Modigliani and Miller demonstrated that changing the capital structure does not affect
                          firm value based on investors being able to create any capital structure they wish for a
                          company by simply borrowing and lending themselves in addition to owning a firm’s
                          shares. This “homemade” leverage argument relies on the assumption that investors
                          can lend and borrow at the risk-free rate.
                              Say, for example that a company has a capital structure consisting of 50% debt
                          and 50% equity and that an individual investor would prefer that the company’s
                          capital structure be 70% debt and 30% equity. The investor could borrow money to
                          finance her share purchases so that her ownership of company assets would reflect
                          her preferred 70% debt financing. This action would be equivalent to buying stock on
                          margin and would have no effect on either the company’s expected operating cash
                          flows or company value.
                              Modigliani and Miller used the concept of arbitrage to demonstrate their point: If
                          the value of an unlevered company (i.e., a company without any debt) is not equal to
                          that of a levered company, investors could make a riskless arbitrage profit at no cost
                          by selling shares of the overvalued company and using the proceeds to buy shares of
                          the undervalued company, forcing their values to become equal. The value of a firm is
                          thus determined not by how it finances itself but, rather, by its expected future cash
                          flows. Their conclusion is summarized next.

MM PROPOSITION I WITHOUT TAXES

   If the market value of a company is not affected by the company’s capital struc-
   ture, then the following is true:

          1. The value of the levered company (VL) is equal to the value of the
             unlevered company (VU), or VL = VU.
          2. The value of a company is determined solely by its expected future
             cash flows (not its relative use of debt versus equity capital).
          3. In the absence of taxes, the weighted-average cost of capital is unaf-
             fected by capital structure.



Higher Financial Leverage Raises the Cost of Equity (MM
Proposition II without Taxes)
Debt is less costly than equity because debtholders have a priority claim. Therefore,
one might expect a company’s WACC to decline by increasing the proportion of debt
in its capital structure. However, adding financial leverage increases risk, because
more debt increases the probability of bankruptcy. As a result, equity investors will
demand a higher return on equity to offset the increase in risk.
    MM Proposition II without taxes tells us that adding any amount of lower-cost
debt capital to the capital structure is always perfectly offset by an increase in the cost
of equity, resulting in no change in the company’s WACC. MM Proposition II explains
why investors require higher returns on levered equity; their required returns should
match the increased risk from leverage. Specifically, MM Proposition II without taxes
implies that a firm’s equity cost is a linear function of its debt-to-equity ratio (D/E):

    where re is the cost of equity, r0 is the cost of capital for a company financed only
with equity, rd is the cost of debt, D is the market value of debt, and E is the market
value of equity. Exhibit 4 shows this relationship.

                          any chosen capital structure, there is no change in the value of the company. Note that
                          Modigliani and Miller did not assume away the possibility of bankruptcy but simply
                          assumed it occurs at zero cost.

                           MM PROPOSITION II WITHOUT TAXES

                             If the cost of equity is assumed to be a linear function of the company’s debt-
                             to-equity ratio, then the following is true:

                                1. Higher leverage raises the cost of equity but does not change firm
                                   value or WACC.
                                2. The increase in the cost of equity must exactly offset the greater use of
                                   lower-cost debt.


                           EXAMPLE 2

                             Gerhardt Corporation Cost of Equity
                             Assume that Gerhardt Corporation has an all-equity capital structure. Gerhardt
                             has expected annual cash flows (or CFe) of EUR5,000 and a cost of equity of
                             10%, which is also its WACC since equity is the firm’s only source of capital. For
                             simplicity, we assume that all cash flows are perpetual. Therefore, Gerhardt’s
                             value is equal to
                                      C ​Fe​  ​​
                                      _               EUR5,000

                                  Now suppose that Gerhardt plans to issue EUR15,000 in debt at a cost of
                             5% and use the proceeds to buy back and reduce its outstanding equity by
                             EUR15,000. This action leaves total invested capital unchanged at EUR50,000.
                                  Under MM Proposition I, VL = VU, the value of Gerhardt must remain the
                             same at EUR50,000 after the change in capital structure. Under MM Proposition
                             II, after the change in capital structure, the cost of equity for Gerhardt—now
                             with EUR15,000 in debt capital and EUR35,000 in equity capital—increases to
                             12.143%:
                                                                 EUR15,000

                                 To prove that Gerhardt’s firm value is unchanged under the new capital
                             structure, we must show its WACC remains unchanged at 10%. With the new
                             cost of equity, Gerhardt’s WACC is now calculated as

                                        ​​  = ​(_

                                                                         ​  EUR50,000 ​)​0.12143 = 0.10 = 10 % .​
                                                   EUR15,000        EUR35,000

                                    ​ 

                                Gerhardt’s WACC is still 10%, because the move to lower-cost debt was
                             perfectly offset by an increase in the cost of equity. Thus, consistent with
                             MM Proposition I, the value of the firm remains unchanged, at EUR50,000.
                             Furthermore, the value of Gerhardt must equal the sum of the present values of

   cash flows to debtholders (CFd) and shareholders (CFe). With EUR15,000 debt
   at a cost of 5% (rd), Gerhardt makes the following debtholder and shareholder
   payments:
      CFd = D × rd.

      EUR750 = EUR15,000 × 5%.
      This leaves EUR5,000 − EUR750 = EUR4,250 remaining for shareholders

Firm Value with Taxes (MM Proposition II with Taxes)
In most jurisdictions, interest expense is deductible from a company’s income for tax
purposes. In other words, debt provides a tax shield for companies that are earning
profits, and the money saved in taxes enhances the value of the company. Ignoring
other factors, such as the costs of financial distress and bankruptcy, for now, let us
explore the two MM propositions when we relax the assumption of no corporate taxes.
   The value of the company increases with increasing levels of debt, and the actual
cost of debt is reduced by the amount of the tax benefit:

   After-tax cost of debt = Before-tax cost of debt × (1 − Marginal tax rate).
    Modigliani and Miller’s Proposition I with corporate taxes states that in the presence
of corporate taxes (but not personal taxes), the value of the levered company is greater
than that of the all-equity company by an amount equal to the tax rate multiplied by
the value of the debt (tD), defined as the present value of the debt tax shield:
   VL = VU + tD,                                                                    (5)
   where t is the marginal tax rate and tD is the present value of the debt tax shield.
When there are corporate taxes, a profitable company can increase its value by using
debt financing, as shown in Exhibit 5.

                          attributable to the tax shield. Taken to its (unrealistic) extreme, Equation 5 predicts
                          a value-maximizing capital structure of 100% debt.

                           MM PROPOSITION I WITH CORPORATE TAXES

                             If the market value of a levered company is equal to the value of an unlevered
                             company plus the value of the debt tax shield, then the following is true:

                                    1. In the presence of taxes, a profitable company can increase its value
                                       (V) by using debt.
                                    2. The higher the tax rate, the greater the benefit of using debt in the
                                       capital structure.



                          Cost of Capital (MM Proposition II with Taxes)
                          If the value of the company increases as it uses more debt, the company’s WACC must
                          decrease as it uses more debt. That is, in the earlier propositions without corporate
                          taxes, the lower cost of debt was fully offset by an increase in the cost of equity. Now,
                          in the presence of corporate taxes, the cost of debt is further lowered by the tax benefit
                          such that the lower debt cost outweighs the increase in the cost of equity and results
                          in a lower WACC.
                               To demonstrate this idea, let’s begin with the revised cost of equity under MM
                          Proposition II with corporate taxes:
                              	​​re​  ​​  = ​r​ 0​​  + ​(​r​ 0​​ − ​r​ d​​)(​​ 1 − t)_

                                                                                         E ​.​	                                     (6)

                          Notice that the only difference between Equation 6 and Equation 4 (MM Proposition
                          II with no taxes) is the presence of the term (1 − t). When t is zero, the two equations
                          are identical. When t is not zero, the term (1 − t) is less than 1 and serves to reduce
                          the cost of levered equity. The cost of equity still rises as the company increases the
                          amount of debt in its capital structure, but it rises at a slower rate than in the no-tax
                          case. as shown in Exhibit 6.

Consequently, as debt increases, the company’s rWACC decreases and the company’s
value increases. This result implies that when there are taxes (and no financial distress
or bankruptcy costs), debt financing is highly advantageous. Taken to an extreme,
this result also suggests that a company’s optimal capital structure is 100% debt—a
conclusion that is at odds with reality and a direct result of Modigliani and Miller’s
restrictive assumptions.

MM PROPOSITION II WITH CORPORATE TAXES

   If the cost of equity is a linear function of the company’s debt-to-equity ratio
   with an adjustment for the tax rate, then the following is true:

         1. In the presence of taxes, the cost of equity rises as the company uses
            more debt but at a slower rate than in the no-tax case.
         2. As the company’s use of debt increases, its WACC decreases and its
            value increases.
         3. In the presence of taxes (but no financial distress or bankruptcy costs),
            the use of debt is value enhancing and, at the extreme, 100% debt is
            optimal.


EXAMPLE 3

   Gerhardt Corporation under Corporate Taxes
   Recall from the previous example that annual cash flows to Gerhardt share-
   holders were EUR5,000 and the cost of equity (and WACC) was 10%. As before,
   Gerhardt is planning to issue EUR15,000 of 5% debt to buy back an equivalent
   amount of equity. Now, however, assume that Gerhardt pays corporate taxes
   at a rate of 25%.
       Since the company does not currently have debt, the after-tax cash flows are
   now EUR5,000(1 − 0.25), or EUR3,750. Because the cash flows are assumed to
   be perpetual, the value of the company is EUR37,500 (= EUR3,750/0.10), con-
   siderably less than the amount when there were no corporate taxes, EUR50,000.

                                Now, suppose Gerhardt proceeds to issue EUR15,000 of debt and uses the
                             proceeds to repurchase equity. According to MM Proposition II with corporate
                             taxes (i.e., Equation 5), the value of the company is
                                 VL = VU + tD = EUR37,500 + 0.25(EUR15,000) = EUR41,250.
                                The total company value is now EUR41,250, consisting of debt of EUR15,000
                             and equity of EUR26,250 (= EUR41,250 − EUR15,000).
                                According to MM Proposition II with corporate taxes (Equation 6), the new
                             cost of equity for Gerhardt is
                                                                                                       EUR15,000

                             the change in capital structure, Gerhardt’s WACC decreased in this example
                             from 10% to 9.091%. This reduction in WACC resulted in an increase in com-
                             pany value to EUR41,250:

                                 Of course, in the real world, taxes are not the only factor affecting the value
                             of a levered company. The analysis becomes more complex when we consider
                             the costs of financial distress, among other real-world considerations.



                          Cost of Financial Distress
                          Financial distress refers to the heightened uncertainty regarding a company’s ability
                          to meet its obligations because of diminished earnings power or actual current losses.
                          Operating and financial leverage can magnify profits but also increase losses and the
                          likelihood of financial distress. Even before filing for bankruptcy, companies under
                          financial distress may lose customers, creditors, suppliers, and employees.
                              Direct costs of financial distress are cash expenses associated with bankruptcy,
                          such as legal and administrative fees, while indirect costs include forgone business
                          and investment opportunities, reputational risk, and costs arising from conflicts of
                          interest between managers and debtholders, or agency costs of debt, when a firm is
                          near or in bankruptcy.
                              Costs of financial distress are lower for firms whose assets have a ready secondary
                          market. Airlines, shipping companies, and some manufacturers have tangible assets
                          that can be easily sold. Technology, pharmaceutical, and information technology firms,
                          as well as those in the service sector, usually lack such assets and have higher costs
                          associated with financial distress. The probability of financial distress and bankruptcy
                          rises with more debt in the capital structure, higher sales risk and operating leverage,
                          and lower liquidity. The task of optimizing a firm’s capital structure by taking these
                          and other factors into consideration is the subject of the next lesson.

EXAMPLE 4

  The Costs of Financial Distress
  Rite Aid Corporation, listed on the NYSE, operates over 2,000 retail pharmacies
  in the United States. The company has a highly leveraged balance sheet, with
  a ratio of net debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
  amortization over 5.0 for many years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
  company performed well, exceeding profit expectations largely due to brisk
  COVID-19 testing and vaccine revenues. However, as the pandemic entered
  its third year, vaccine and testing revenue began to fall, and other issues, such
  as pricing declines from insurance companies and wage pressures, accelerated.
  Owing to its high financial leverage, the ensuing reduction in analysts’ profit
  estimates resulted in large declines in the prices of Rite Aid debt and equity:
  Over the first five months of 2022, the price of its 02/15/2027 unsecured notes
  fell from 94 to 60 and its stock price fell from $15 to $6 per share. By May 2022,
  Rite Aid’s cost of debt exceeded 20%.
       In April 2022, one equity analyst lowered the estimated fair value of Rite
  Aid stock from $16 to $1 and warned that the stock may in fact be worthless.
  According to the analyst, the company faced $200 million per year in interest
  expenses and another $225 million per year in maintenance capital expenditures.
  The analyst estimated that next fiscal year, the company would achieve only
  $370 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization,
  and the analyst warned that it faces considerable challenges in growing beyond
  that. Continued net losses would render the stock worthless and likely require
  the company to restructure its obligations with its bondholders.
       During its quarterly earnings call, management was upbeat, but it intends to
  close 145 underperforming stores to lower its expenses and further cut corporate
  costs to improve profitability.


QUESTION SET


  1. The view that debt financing is highly advantageous and the optimal
     capital structure is 100% debt is consistent with:
      A. MM without taxes.
      B. MM with taxes and financial distress costs.
      C. MM with taxes and no financial distress cost.
     Solution:
     C is correct. MM with taxes and no distress cost leads to the conclusion that
     the optimal capital structure is 100% debt. This is because tax law favors
     debt financing over equity financing since the interest expense on debt
     financing is tax deductible. Ignoring financial distress costs, the value of the
     company increases with increasing levels of debt. The value of the levered
     firm (VL) is greater than that of the unlevered one (VU) by the amount equal
     to the tax rate multiplied by the level of debt (tD).

  2. True or False: What is clear from MM is that the primary driver of firm
     value is capital structure.

                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. This statement is false since it is future cash flows that are the
                                primary driver of value. Under a set of restrictive assumptions, MM’s con-
                                clusion of capital structure irrelevance is obtained. Relaxing these assump-
                                tions, MM showed that capital structure does impact value, but it has only a
                                modest impact compared to future cash flows.

                             3. MM Proposition II without taxes differs from MM Proposition I without
                                taxes since it concludes that:
                                A. WACC is unaffected by capital structure.
                                B. the value of the levered firm is equal to that of the unlevered firm.
                                 C. higher leverage raises the cost of equity, which exactly offsets the
                                    lower cost of debt.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. MM Proposition II without taxes differs from MM Proposi-
                                tion I without taxes in that the cost of equity will rise with leverage and
                                completely offset the lower cost of debt. Debt has a lower cost relative to
                                equity because debtholders have a priority claim on the cash flow of the
                                firm. So, one would expect WACC to decline with more debt. MM Propo-
                                sition II without taxes argues that the cost of equity is a linear function of
                                the debt-to-equity ratio. The addition of more low-cost debt to the capital
                                structure will increase the debt-to-equity ratio and raise the cost of equity,
                                offsetting the lower debt cost. As a result, the firm’s WACC is unchanged.

                             Company Y has an unlevered WACC of 10%. It has a cost of debt equal to 5.5%
                             and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.75. The corporate tax rate is 25%.

                             4. Fill in the blanks: The cost of equity for Company Y will be _____________ if
                                it pays no corporate taxes and _____________ if it pays corporate taxes.
                                Solution:
                                The cost of equity for Company Y will be 13.37% if it pays no corporate taxes
                                and 12.53% if it pays corporate taxes.
                                The cost of equity is a linear function of its debt-to-equity ratio and without
                                taxes is calculated as follows:

                                	​​re​  ​​  = ​r​ 0​​  + ​(​r​ 0​​ − ​r​ d​​)_

                                                                                 E ​​

                                = 10% + (10% – 5.5%)(0.75) = 13.37%.
                                The cost of equity with taxes is calculated as

                                	​​re​  ​​  = ​r​ 0​​  + ​(​r​ 0​​ − ​r​ d​​)(​​ 1 − t)_

                                                                                           E ​​

                                = 10% + (10% – 5.5%)(1 – 0.25)(0.75) = 12.53%.


                             5. If Company Y is an all-equity-financed firm, its cost of equity will be
                                ________ its WACC.
                                A. greater than

      C. lower than
     Solution:
     B is correct. Since Company Y is an unlevered firm and has no debt in its
     capital structure, the cost of equity will be the same as WACC. Since the
     weighting of debt is zero, the WACC formula is simply
     WACC = Weighting of equity × Cost of equity.




OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
                                                                                                    5
               describe optimal and target capital structures

While the Modigliani–Miller propositions offer an initial framework for capital struc-
ture decisions, a company’s managers facing capital structure choices must address
trade-offs simultaneously while incorporating those factors outlined in prior lessons.
For example, consider a more real-world-appropriate scenario with both corporate taxes
and bankruptcy/financial distress costs. The value-enhancing effect of the tax shield
from leverage is offset by the value-reducing impact of the present value of expected
(or probability-weighted) costs of financial distress or bankruptcy. We can show this
trade-off by incorporating the potential cost of financial distress or bankruptcy into
the value of a levered firm:
   VL = VU + tD − PV(Costs of financial distress).                                            (7)
Equation 7 represents what is sometimes referred to as the static trade-off theory
of capital structure, which is illustrated in Exhibit 7.

                          VU represents the value of an unlevered or all-equity firm. As debt is added to the capital
                          structure, the new levered firm value is derived from Equation 7. At low debt levels,
                          the tax benefit of debt usually outweighs potential financial distress costs, resulting
                          in a higher firm value. However, as debt increases, the possible financial distress costs
                          rise substantially and equal the tax benefit of debt at D*. Beyond this point, greater
                          leverage reduces firm value, and the present value of financial distress costs outweighs
                          the tax benefit. The debt level corresponding to D*, which maximizes firm value, and
                          the associated level of equity are referred to as the optimal capital structure.
                              Managers cannot precisely estimate D* in practice but, rather, establish a target
                          capital structure based on these two considerations, as well as the internal and exter-
                          nal factors outlined in earlier lessons. There are several reasons why a firm’s actual
                          capital structure may differ from its target. For example, management may exploit
                          short-term opportunities in a particular financing source. A company able to issue
                          debt at attractive rates, for instance, may borrow more than planned in response to
                          strong investor demand. Also, changing market values of the company’s debt and
                          equity securities can cause the firm’s actual capital structure to deviate from a target.
                          Transaction costs and minimum deal sizes make it impractical for firms to constantly
                          align capital structure to a specific number. As a result, firm managers usually set an
                          optimal capital range: for example, 30%–50% debt rather than 40%.
                              While prior WACC calculations and debt and equity weights were made with the
                          market value of equity and debt, target capital structure is often expressed using the
                          book value of equity and debt for the following reasons:
                              1. Market values can fluctuate substantially and seldom impact the appropri-
                                 ate level of borrowing. On the contrary, a company whose share price has
                                 risen rapidly may take advantage of this by raising equity capital rather than
                                 debt to maintain a certain debt-to-equity ratio.
                              2. For management, the primary concern is the amount and types of capital
                                 invested by the company, not in the company. This perspective includes how
                                 working capital and capital projects will be funded. It differs from that of a
                                 shareholder who has purchased shares at the prevailing market price seeking
                                 a return on that investment.
                              3. Capital structure policy is aligned to measures used by third parties. Since
                                 lenders, debt investors, and rating agencies generally focus on the book
                                 value of debt and equity for their calculation measures, firm managers take
                                 this fact into account in determining their capital structure policies.
                              Although it is common for target capital structures to be expressed in terms of
                          book values, managers pay close attention to the price and market interest rates on
                          their equity and debt outstanding to gauge when to raise capital and how much and
                          what type to raise.


                          Target Weights and WACC
                          In the first lesson, when computing WACC, we used the current market values of
                          debt and equity to compute the weights. An alternative approach would be to use the
                          target capital structure, especially if management discloses it. Independent analysts
                          unaware of the firm’s target may estimate it using one of several methods:
                              1. Assume the company’s current capital structure, at market value weights for
                                 the components, represents the company’s target capital structure.
                              2. Examine capital structure trends or management statements regarding capi-
                                 tal structure policy to infer a company’s target capital structure.
                              3. Use averages of comparable companies’ capital structures as the target.

   Note that a simple way of transforming a debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) into a weight—
that is, D/(D + E)—is to divide D/E by 1 + D/E.

  3. Calculate the proportions of debt and equity for the WACC analysis if Ger-
     hardt announces that a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.7 reflects its target capital
     structure.
     Solution:
     A debt-to-equity ratio of 0.7 represents a weight on debt of 0.7/1.7 = 0.4118,
     so wd = 0.4118 and we = 1 − 0.4118 = 0.5882. These would be the preferred
     weights to use in a cost-of-capital calculation.



Pecking Order Theory and Agency Costs
Investors and issuers have asymmetric information. Issuer management has access to
more information about its business and its prospects than is publicly available, and
managers are likely to use this information to their advantage when seeking financing.

                          Debt and equity investors demand higher returns from companies with higher infor-
                          mation asymmetry because they may be concerned that new securities are overpriced;
                          that is, a company will either issue equity when its shares are expensive or issue new
                          debt when the firm’s creditworthiness is about to deteriorate.
                              Since investors often closely watch manager behavior for insight into a company’s
                          prospects, managers consider what their actions might signal to outsiders. The sig-
                          naling model of capital structure suggests a hierarchy (or pecking order) of methods
                          for financing new investments.
                              The pecking order theory, developed by Stewart C. Myers and Nicholas S. Majluf
                          in 1984, suggests that managers give first preference to financing methods with the
                          least potential information content (internally generated funds) and last preference
                          to methods with the most potential information content (public equity offerings).
                          Public equity offerings often raise skepticism among investors because existing owners
                          would seem less likely to want to share ownership of a company with strong future
                          prospects. As a result, managers prefer internal financing, and if external financing is
                          needed, they prefer private debt to public debt and prefer equity issuance least of all.
                              Another implication of the work of Myers and Majluf is that issuers tend to issue
                          equity when management believes the stock is overvalued and are reluctant to issue
                          equity if they believe the stock is undervalued, potentially choosing instead to repur-
                          chase shares. Thus, additional issuance of equity, usually to finance an acquisition,
                          is often interpreted by investors as a negative signal. The issuance of debt commits
                          the company to future interest and principal payments, which (along with recurring
                          dividends) may be interpreted as a sign of management confidence in the company’s
                          future ability to make such payments. These signals are considered too costly for
                          poorly performing companies to afford.
                              Alternatively, the signal of issuing equity at the bottom of the pecking order holds
                          other clues. If, for instance, the company’s cost of capital increases after an equity
                          issuance, we can interpret this effect as an indication that management needs capital
                          beyond what comes cheaply; in other words, this is a negative signal regarding the
                          company’s prospects. Managers may hesitate to issue new equity when they believe
                          the company’s shares are underpriced, because they wish to avoid signaling that they
                          believe the shares are overpriced and also to avoid the cost and effort involved with
                          new equity issuance.
                              Agency costs were introduced in an earlier lesson as the incremental costs arising
                          from conflicts of interest between managers, shareholders, and bondholders. In the
                          case of capital structure decisions, savings in the agency costs of equity may arise
                          with the increased use of debt. Similarly, the more financially leveraged a company,
                          the less freedom for managers to either take on more debt or spend cash unwisely.
                          This is the foundation of Michael Jensen’s (1986) free cash flow hypothesis: Higher
                          debt levels discipline managers by forcing them to manage the company efficiently
                          and use cash wisely so the company can make its interest and principal payments.

                             Agency Costs, Asymmetric Information, and Signaling
                             CLP AG, a small, listed biopharmaceutical company, is conducting a clinical trial
                             of its drug, which is already approved for treatment of an autoimmune disorder,
                             to be used in a new application for which it was not originally intended: treatment

Optimal Capital Structure                                                                207


  of a type of viral infection. Management hopes this new application for the drug
  will result in a big increase in sales and the value of the company. The company
  has been consistently profitable and debt free. The following events occur:
      ■   In July, management receives notice from the clinical trial investigators
          that results look promising. Anticipating that it might have to scale
          up production quickly, the company negotiates and announces a large
          increase in its credit line.
      ■   In August, CLP announces successful test results by public press
          release. CLP shares increase by 35%.
      Explain how asymmetric information and signaling are represented here.

  1. Asymmetric information
     Solution
     Asymmetric information is represented by management's knowledge of the
     positive trial results in July, before they were publicly announced in August.
     Signaling is represented by the company's announcement in July that it was
     increasing its credit line. The announcement could reasonably be taken as
     a signal of management's confidence that the trial results will be positive
     and that the company will need to expand production capacity. This is true
     whether or not the signaling is intentional.



QUESTION SET


  1. True or False: Under the pecking order theory, the firm has no op-
     timal capital structure and a firm’s capital structure reflects its historic need
     for external financing.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     A is correct. The pecking order theory is based on asymmetric information
     held by investors and issuers and the idea that managers consider what their
     actions may signal to investors. The signaling model suggests a hierarchy
     in methods in financing the firm. Internal funds are used first, then debt is
     used, and finally, reluctantly, firms use equity. There is no optimal capital
     structure, and a firm’s capital structure reflects its historic need for external
     financing.

  2. Company Z announces that a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2 is consistent with
     its target capital structure. Given this value, the weight for equity in the
     WACC calculation is:
      A. 45%.
      B. 55%.
      C. 83%.
     Solution:
     A is correct. A simple way of transforming a debt-to-equity ratio (D/E)
     into a weight—that is, D/(D + E)—is to divide D/E by 1 + D/E. Therefore, a
     debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2 represents a weight on debt of 1.2/2.2 = 0.5455,

                                so wd = 0.5455 and we = 1 − 0.5455 = 0.4545. Thus, the weight for equity in
                                the WACC calculation is 45%.

                             3. Match each of the following concepts on the left with a capital structure the-
                                ory/hypothesis on the right:
                                                                      ​

                                                                      ​




                                Solution:

                                1. C. The static trade-off theory of capital structure determines the opti-
                                   mal capital structure.
                                2. A. The free cash flow hypothesis is based on agency costs and the idea
                                   that higher debt levels impose discipline on managers to avoid perks
                                   and non-value-adding acquisitions.
                                3. B. The pecking order theory is based on asymmetric information held
                                   by investors and issuers and the important role of signaling.

                             4. The value-reducing impact of financial distress or bankruptcy increases if
                                the firm has:
                                A. higher business risk.
                                B. lower operating and financial leverage.
                                 C. assets with a ready secondary market.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The probability and cost of financial distress rise for firms with
                                higher business risk and more debt in the capital structure. In contrast, the
                                cost of financial distress is lower for firms with lower operating and financial
                                leverage and for firms with assets that have a secondary market and can be
                                easily sold.

                             5. True or False: The target capital structure should be estimated using the
                                market value of equity and debt in calculating WACC.
                                A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Target capital structure is often estimated using book values
                                because market values can fluctuate significantly and are unlikely to impact
                                borrowing capacity. Issuers will often aim for a certain credit rating, such as
                                investment grade, which is strongly influenced by the issuer’s (book value)
                                level of indebtedness relative to cash flows.

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS


The following information relates to questions
1-4
   A financial analyst is evaluating the capital structure for Boulder, Inc. Boulder,
   Inc., is a US-based unleveraged firm with a constant (perpetual) cash flow of $6
   million per year before taxes. The firm has a market value of $45 million and a
   corporate tax rate of 30%. Boulder plans to issue $15 million in debt to retire an
   equivalent amount of equity. The debt will have a cost of 5.5%.
   The financial analyst notes that the tax shield advantage of debt is offset due to
   the risk of financial distress. He estimates the present value of the cost of finan-
   cial distress at various debt levels as follows:

         Value of Debt                       Present Value of Cost of Distress

         $5 million                          $0.1 million
         $10 million                         $0.2 million
         $15 million                         $0.5 million
         $20 million                         $1.5 million
         $25 million                         $6.0 million
         $30 million                         $12.0 million


1. The WACC of the unleveraged firm, prior to the debt issue, is closest to:
   A. 4.00%.

   B. 9.33%.

   C. 13.33%.

2. The use of the $15 million of debt financing increases the value of Boulder by
   ____________ over its unlevered value. Ignore the costs of financial distress.
   A. $4.5 million

   B. $10.5 million

   C. $15 million

3. Including the present value of the cost of distress, the value of Boulder is closest
   to:
   A. $49 million.

   B. $55 million.

   C. $59.5 million.

4. The level of debt that will maximize the value of Boulder Inc. is closest to:
   A. $15 million.

                          5. A financial analyst is evaluating the capital structure for Plover, Inc., a
                             European-based unleveraged firm with a constant (perpetual) cash flow of
                             EUR10.0 million per year before taxes. The firm has a market value of EUR100.0
                             million and a corporate tax rate of 20%. Plover plans to issue EUR35.0 million in
                             debt to retire an equivalent amount of equity, so the size of the firm will remain
                             unchanged. The debt will have a cost of 4.5%. Assume the cost of financial dis-
                             tress is close to zero.
                             After the debt issuance and change in the capital structure, Plover’s WACC is
                             closest to:
                              A. 5.47%.

                              B. 7.48%.

                              C. 8.82%.

Solutions                                                                                   211




     SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. The after-tax cash flows for the company are $6 million × (1 – 0.30)
   = $4.2 million. Since the cash flows are assumed to be perpetual, WACC is calcu-
   lated as follows:
     rWACC = CF(1 – t)/V = $4.2/$45 = 9.33%.
     Since this is an all-equity firm, the cost of equity is equal to WACC.

2. A is correct. According to MM Proposition I with corporate taxes, the value of
   the levered company is greater than that of the unlevered company by an amount
   equal to the tax rate multiplied by the value of the debt (tD), defined as the pres-
   ent value of the debt tax shield.
     VL = VU + tD = $45 million + 0.30($15million) = $49.5 million.
     Thus, the use of debt financing will increase the value of Boulder by $4.5 million
     over the unlevered firm. Note that the firm’s value increases continuously as
     additional debt is added to the capital structure, and the optimal capital structure
     is 100% debt.

3. A is correct. With financial distress included, as debt is added to the capital struc-
   ture, the levered value of the firm is given by:

     VL = VU + tD − PV(Costs of financial distress).
     The levered value of Boulder financed with $15 million in debt is

     VL = $45 million + 0.30($15 million) – $0.5 million = $49 million.

4. B is correct. With financial distress included, as debt is added to the capital struc-
   ture, the levered value of the firm is given by:

     VL = VU + tD − PV(Costs of financial distress).
     The following shows calculations of the levered value of Boulder at various debt
     levels, in $millions.

             PV(Costs of financial
D            distress)               VL = VU + tD − PV(Costs of financial distress).

5            0.1                     VL = 45 + 0.3(5) – 0.1
                                     VL = 46.4
10           0.2                     VL = 45 + 0.3(10) – 0.2
                                     VL = 47.8
15           0.5                     VL = 45 + 0.3(15) – 0.5
                                     VL = 49
20           1.5                     VL = 45 + 0.3(20) – 1.5
                                     VL = 49.5
25           6.0                     VL = 45 + 0.3(25) – 6.0
                                     VL = 46.5
30           12.0                    VL = 45 + 0.3(30) – 12.0
                                     VL = 42

     Thus, the optimal amount of debt is $20 million, which maximizes the value of
     Boulder at a level of $49.5 million. Beyond $20 million in debt, greater leverage

                              reduces the firm value because the present value of financial distress costs more
                              than the offsetting tax benefit.

                          5. B is correct. The calculations to determine the WACC are as follows:
                             The after-tax cash flows for the company are EUR10.0 million (1 – 0.20) =
                             EUR8.0 million. Since the cash flows are assumed to be perpetual, WACC for the
                             unlevered firm is calculated as

                              rWACC = CF(1 – t)/V = EUR8.0 million/EUR100.0 million = 8.0%.
                              The market value of Plover with the debt financing is EUR107 million:

                              VL = VU + tD = EUR100.0 million + 0.20(EUR35.0 million) = EUR107.0 million.
                              To find the cost of equity, we first need to find the market value of equity:

                              VL = D + E, where D and E are market values of debt and equity, respectively.
                                E = EUR107.0 million – EUR35.0 million = EUR72.0 million.
                              The cost of equity is given by

                              	​​re​  ​​  = ​r​ 0​​  + ​(​r​ 0​​ − ​r​ d​​)​​(1 − t)_
                                                                                    ​​  D
                                                                                        E ​​

                              = 8.0% + (8.0% – 4.5%)(0.80)(EUR35.0 million/EUR72.0 million) = 9.36%.
                              Plover’s WACC is calculated as follows:
                              WACC = (Weighting of debt × Cost of debt) + (Weighting of equity × Cost of
                              equity)

                              = (EUR35 million/EUR107.0 million)(4.5%)(1 – 0.2) + (EUR72.0 million/
                              EUR107.0 million)(9.36%)

                              = 7.48%, which is lower than the 8.0% for the unlevered firm.

 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              describe key features of business models
              describe various types of business models




INTRODUCTION
A clearly described business model helps the analyst understand a business: its strategy,
                                                                                            1
operations, target markets, key customers, suppliers, and ultimately prospects, risks,
and financial profile. Many firms have conventional business models that are easily
understood and have long existed, such as manufacturers and retailers. However,
many business models are complex, novel, or a combination of models. Technological
innovation, particularly digitalization, has enabled significant business model innova-
tion over the past decades. Analysts need to develop their own understanding of an
issuer’s business model to inform their outlook and risk assessment; analysts should
not rely solely on management’s description of its business model.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   A business model addresses four key parts of a business: the
           customers (the “who”), the firm’s product and service offerings
           (the “what” and often the “why”), channels for reaching customers (the
           “where”), and pricing (the “how much”).
       ■   A pricing model describes the amount customers are billed for units of
           products or services. A firm’s value proposition refers to the product
           attributes that lead customers to purchase the product rather than
           those of competitors. A firm’s value chain refers to how a firm struc-
           tures its systems and processes to create value for its customers.
       ■   Conventional business models are common and long established,
           while unconventional business models are based on innovations or
           industry-specific combinations and variations of conventional models.

                                 ■   Digital technology has been particularly influential for business model
                                     innovation by generating new products, new channels, new ways to
                                     communicate and exchange information, and new methods for han-
                                     dling financial transactions.



                           LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                             These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                             of understanding of this learning module.

                             1. ________________ refers to characterizing types of customers a firm may
                                serve according to attributes such as geography, demographics, behavior,
                                preferences, income, affinity for technology, and self-image.
                                A. Channeling
                                B. Segmenting
                                 C. Direct selling
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Companies often identify and group prospective or current
                                customers into segments based on attributes useful for sales, marketing, and
                                product design.

                             2. The objective of ________________ is to maximize profit in situations where
                                different customers have different willingness or ability to pay.
                                A. unit economics
                                B. price discrimination
                                 C. functional separation
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Firms can price the same or similar products and services
                                differently by customer segment, volume purchased, season, time of day,
                                channel, and so on, based on perceived customer preferences to expand
                                their addressable market.

                             3. Companies selling in markets with many competitors and little or no prod-
                                uct differentiation are often ____________; in contrast, companies selling
                                differentiated products with few competitors tend to have ____________.
                                A. crowdsourcing; bundling
                                B. price takers; pricing power
                                 C. omnichannel; direct sales
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Markets with many competitors and homogeneous products
                                are characterized by having perfect or near-perfect competition market
                                structures, with prices determined by market supply and demand.

                             4. Two examples of pricing models for complex products are ____________,
                                which refers to incentivizing or requiring the purchase of multiple products
                                or services, and ____________, which combines a low price on an initial pur-
                                chase of a durable good with high-margin prices on associated consumables.
                                A. bundling; razor, razorblade

Defining the Business Model                                                                215


      B. fractional ownership; subscriptions
      C. horizontal integration; network effects
     Solution:
     A is correct. Companies often bundle complementary products and services
     by offering a discount for their combined purchase versus the sum of the
     individual prices, such as a product and a repair/maintenance package. A ra-
     zor, razorblade model, named for Gillette’s business model of selling a razor
     with disposable razorblades, combines a durable good sold at near cost with
     high-margin, possibly proprietary consumables needed to use the durable
     good. Other examples include Nespresso and Keurig coffee machines, print-
     ers and toner/ink, and diagnostic instruments and reagents.

  5. ____________ refers to the increase in the value of a network to its users as
     more users join.
      A. “Value chain”
      B. “Network effects”
      C. “Value proposition”
     Solution:
     B is correct. A network in which participants interact or transact with one
     another increases in value as more participants join. Examples of companies
     or services with network effects include financial instrument exchanges,
     payment networks, social media, and phone and other communication net-
     works. Network effects can be a strong barrier to new industry entrants.

  6. ____________ involves user communities that enable voluntary collabora-
     tion between users of a product with generally a small amount of modera-
     tion and oversight by the community host or operator.
      A. Franchising
      B. Crowdsourcing
      C. A loyalty program
     Solution:
     B is correct. Generically, crowdsourcing means obtaining contributions
     from multiple parties. Many digital business models incorporate or utilize
     crowdsourcing as their defining feature, whereby the company creates a
     service that users build, while the company simply creates rules and moder-
     ates user contributions. Common examples include social media, product
     reviews, open source software, and Wikis.




DEFINING THE BUSINESS MODEL
                                                                                       2
             describe key features of business models

Successful new businesses may be based on a new product or technology, but there
are many success stories based on familiar products or services and a new business
model. For example, IKEA successfully combines existing business concepts—low-cost
self-assembly furniture, modernist Scandinavian design, and big box retailing—in a

                          unique and successful way. Similarly, Google did not invent online search but found
                          a way to improve the accuracy of search results and to generate revenues through
                          advertising based on user search data.
                              Often, successful business models are neither new nor unique but proven. Many
                          businesses, such as wholesalers, retailers, law firms, building contractors, banks, and
                          insurers, have conventional business models. Success for these firms hinges not on
                          business model innovation but on superior execution, skill, proprietary technology,
                          a strong brand, scale, scope economies, or other factors.
                              While there is no precise generally accepted definition of a business model, it is a
                          description of how a business works and includes the following:
                              ■    The customer base for the business (“who?”)
                              ■    The product or service the business offers to customers (“what?” and often
                                   “why?”)
                              ■    Where is the firm selling and how do its products and services reach cus-
                                   tomers (“where?”)
                              ■    The pricing strategy (“how much?”)
                              ■    The key assets, partners, and suppliers the business requires (“how?”)
                              A business model should provide enough detail so that the basic elements and
                          relationships are clear, without providing so much detail as to become a business plan.
                          A clear business model should have the elements included in Exhibit 1.



                            Exhibit 1: Business Model

                              What is the firm’s value proposition to its target customer(s)?            What is the firm’s value chain?

                          often provided in annual reports and presentations; management may even provide
                          its own description of the issuer’s business model. The beginning of Tesla’s annual
                          report provides a good example.

       customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and
       by offering financial and other services tailored to our products. Our mis-
       sion to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, engineering
       expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience
       differentiate us from other companies.”
  We can identify two business model elements from this paragraph.
      What: “high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and
  storage systems, and offer services related to our products” and “emphasize
  performance, attractive styling and . . . safety . . . and are continuing to develop
  full self-driving technology.”
      Where: “sell our products directly to customers, including through our website
  and retail locations. We also continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure
  through a global network of vehicle service centers, Mobile Service technicians,
  body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers.”

    In the quote from Tesla, it describes its products and their attributes; venues
in which it sells its products, known as sales channels or simply channels; and its
emphasis on innovation. Analysts use a business model to begin their evaluation of how
effectively it has been implemented, the company’s prospects for future success, and
understanding its implications for exposures to risks and opportunities. Management
can change an issuer’s business model or launch new businesses with distinct models
within the same company, so this must be an ongoing analysis.
    Let’s explore the features of a business model further.

The Customers and the Market (“Who”)
A business model should identify target customers:
   ■   Are there specific types, or segments, of customers served?
   ■   Are customers other businesses (business-to-business or B2B model) or
       consumers (business-to-consumer or B2C model)?
   ■   What geographies will be served?
    Tesla management’s description is silent on which customer segments it is target-
ing, most likely because its target is shifting gradually toward the mass market with
lower-cost and lower-price models. For an analyst, this type of inference can guide
inputs for financial models, such as unit and price forecasts.

                              It is common in consumer markets to think of demographic segments, such as
                          high-income suburban families. In many cases, segmentation is even narrower and
                          is unique to the product or service category—for instance, “affluent early adopters of
                          technology with homes that support plug-in charging in countries with EV subsidies.”
                              Business opportunities often arise because established firms may not effectively
                          serve—or even recognize—certain prospective customer segments. At the same time,
                          choices made concerning a firm’s target customers may introduce other related con-
                          siderations or risks to the firm, such as high barriers to entry, changes in customer
                          segment(s), or greater competition.

                           EXAMPLE 2

                             Segmenting Customers
                             Customers can be classified or segmented in numerous ways, including by
                             their geography, demographics, seasonal or life-cycle timing, and behavior.
                             Sophisticated market analytics can be used in segmenting to further break out
                             smaller, homogeneous markets. Such analyses help such companies as Tesla to
                             develop products and market them effectively.
                                 Tesla positioned its products as the “new technology for clean energy” and
                             moved away from being a company that solely produced expensive, premium
                             electric sports cars to a company that defined what a practical, attractive, elec-
                             tric vehicle could look like. By targeting aspirational middle- and upper-class
                             consumers who not only thrive on status-seeking behavior but also seek to be
                             perceived to be environmentally friendly, socially and environmentally progres-
                             sive, and cost conscious, Tesla expanded its customer markets.
                                 Tesla and other companies can drill down to the postal code level for their
                             customers and segment customers based on their social group, life-cycle stage,
                             and wealth. This allows companies to identify customer cohorts across geog-
                             raphies and combine them into larger homogeneous markets that are easier to
                             access and penetrate using targeted digital advertising.


                          Product or Service Offering (“What” and Often “Why”)
                          The business model should define what product or service the firm offers and how,
                          if at all, it is different from competitor offerings by referencing the needs of its target
                          customers. This helps the analyst identify the addressable market for the business and
                          to understand key opportunities and risks. For example, there may be a high risk of
                          imitation or substitution. Understanding why customers buy the product or service,
                          or the “job” that customers are “hiring” the product or service to fulfill, can help ana-
                          lysts identify current and potential competitors. While trucks and railroads do not
                          seem like competitors, they both fulfill the same customer need: the transportation
                          of goods. A more thoughtful analysis would identify which types of customers and
                          in which scenarios customers would choose truck versus rail transportation (as well
                          as air and marine transportation).
                               Generally, business customers have straightforward needs (e.g., ship goods), are
                          sophisticated buyers, and are motivated to earn a profit. Consumer customers have
                          diverse needs that can be impossible to quantify. Some consumers purchase whichever
                          car is the most economical on a cost per mile basis, while others look to purchase
                          aesthetically pleasing, high-performance, or low-emission vehicles. Certain products
                          can satisfy these needs, and companies can use advertising, promotions, and product
                          placement in media to create these needs in the first place.

    For Tesla, management describes its products quite precisely: “high-performance
fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems.” Some companies,
however, will use overly broad terms in describing their offerings and addressable
markets, overstate differentiation, or reference platforms and networks that may be
very weakly developed—all in an attempt to convince investors that everyone could
be a customer and inflate the value of the business. It is important for analysts to
scrutinize management’s assertions and supplement them with independent research.

EXAMPLE 3

   Business Model Evolution: Netflix
   Netflix’s evolution since its start in 1997 is a prime example of how the “what”
   evolves over time. It started as a DVD rental by mail business in 1998, when the
   home movie rental business was dominated by brick-and-mortar rental stores
   and only 2% of the US households owned a DVD player. Netflix created and
   operated a website for customers to select DVDs to rent and delivered them
   through the mail. Subsequently, the company introduced a subscription model,
   where customers could rent several DVDs at one time for a fixed monthly fee.
   This new service disrupted the entire video rental industry.
       Netflix’s direct rival at the time was Blockbuster, but it took Blockbuster
   years to offer the same service as Netflix. By that time, Netflix had launched a
   new business model: a subscription-based, online-streaming video platform, and
   began to de-emphasize its DVD rental business. Through substantial investment
   in video content and improving streaming technology, Netflix grew to millions
   of monthly subscribers. The monthly subscription fee is substantially lower than
   monthly cable service fees, though Netflix has increased prices significantly over
   time. Netflix has differentiated its platform by producing exclusive content.
       Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and ceased operations in 2014.


Channels (“Where”)
A firm’s channel strategy refers to “where” the firm is selling its offering; that is, how
does it reach its customers? Channel strategy usually includes two main functions:
selling the firm’s products and services (“sales and marketing”) and delivering them
to customers (“distribution” or “logistics”).
    In assessing a firm’s channel strategy, it is important to distinguish between what
functions the firm can perform internally and what functions are better done by
strategic partners and suppliers. For example, many business software companies do
not install their software on customers’ systems. Instead, customers hire a third-party
consulting firm, which often provides additional ongoing services. Exhibit 2 provides
examples of the functions, assets, and firms that may be part of the channel strategy
for a firm.

                              • after-sale service




                          For companies that sell physical products, the traditional channel strategy is typically
                          reflected in the flow of inventory through a series of intermediaries before reaching
                          the final customer. Firms at each stage have their own physical facilities, and the
                          product is purchased and then re-sold by the intermediaries at each stage until it is
                          sold to the final customer.
                              Some companies, however, employ a direct sales strategy, selling directly to the end
                          customer. Direct sales is a common and longstanding channel strategy for complex or
                          high-margin products or services, such as medical devices, industrial equipment, and
                          luxury goods. It is common in B2B models where the universe of potential customers
                          is relatively small and easily reached. Historically, direct sales involved a significant
                          investment in salespeople, but this is increasingly either substituted or supplemented
                          with digital sales capabilities. Exhibit 3 contrasts the interactions of a traditional
                          channel strategy with a direct sales strategy.

                          Often, channels are used in combination. A so-called omnichannel strategy, common
                          for apparel and consumer packaged goods, relies on both digital and physical channels
                          to complete a sale. For example, a customer might order an item online and pick it
                          up in a store or select an item in a store and have it delivered.

EXAMPLE 4

   Adidas
   Adidas is the world’s second largest sportswear brand and combines four channels
   to distribute its products: retail shops, franchise outlets, wholesale business, and
   its own e-commerce. The following excerpt from its annual report summarizes
   its channel strategy:

        “With more than 2,500 own-retail stores, more than 15,000 mono-branded
        franchise stores and more than 150,000 wholesale doors, we have an unri-
        valed network of consumer touchpoints within our industry. In addition,
        through our own e-commerce channel, our single biggest store available
        to consumers in over 40 countries, we are leveraging a consistent global
        framework.”

   -management​-report​-our​-company/​corporate​-strategy/​sales​-and​-distribution​-strategy​.html

     The channels used by a business are material drivers of revenues and cost behav-
ior, profitability, and sensitivity to internal and external risk factors. Companies that
employ a direct sales strategy have the advantage of a close relationship to customers
and do not risk their products being shown alongside competitors on a shelf. However,
direct sales impose significant cost, an important portion of which is fixed salaries
and benefits.
     How a firm’s channel strategy differs from those of its competitors is an important
factor to consider. For example, Tesla references its direct sales strategy, which is dif-
ferent from its US competitors, which sell to franchised dealers. This difference will
affect comparability of financial results between Tesla and US automakers.

Pricing (“How Much”)
A business model needs to provide sufficient detail about pricing so that the logic of
the business is clear.
    ■   Does the firm price at a premium, at parity, or at a discount relative to
        competitors?
    ■   How do prices and costs compare?
    ■   How is the firm’s pricing justified in its business model?
    Companies selling in markets with many competitors and little or no product dif-
ferentiation are price takers that simply receive the market price determined by supply
and demand; they are known as commodity producers. Examples of commodities
include oil and gas, pharmaceuticals that are no longer patented, and many types of
loans. Companies selling in markets with few competitors or with highly differen-
tiated products enjoy more pricing power, or the ability to maintain prices above
costs or increase prices without negatively impacting customer demand. A business
that does not have pricing power is likely to pursue a cost leadership strategy, seeking
to be the lowest-cost producer, such as discount retailers Costco and Lidl and the
low-cost airline Ryanair.
    Companies charging premium prices may justify doing so by emphasizing cost
savings for customers elsewhere or by adding services for a reduced price (or free).
For example, while Tesla’s vehicles are priced at a premium, the annual report refer-
ences a lower total cost of ownership, which refers to the aggregate direct and indirect
costs associated with owning an asset over its life span. After considering government
subsidies and the lower costs of electric charging compared with petroleum, the price
is more competitive (though there is a risk of subsidies decreasing or ceasing in the

222   Learning Module 7                                                                           Business Models


                          future). This value proposition— the reduced total cost of ownership through some
                          combination of product capabilities, reliability, ease of maintenance and operation,
                          training, and so on—is common to business models in many sectors.
                              In some cases, however, companies do not “justify” premium pricing but, rather,
                          establish strong brands and distinctiveness that customers value. While some of Tesla’s
                          prices can be justified based on lower total costs of ownership, much of it is owed to
                          the aesthetic, performance, and intangible characteristics valued by customers and
                          created by the company and its advertising. The same is true for most premium and
                          luxury goods and services.


                          Pricing and Revenue Models
                          A pricing model describes how much money customers are billed for units of products
                          or services. There are many models because there are many ways to specify a unit of
                          product or service, and varying prices can be established, known as price discrimi-
                          nation, based on such factors as quality or grade, units sold, channel, customer size
                          and type, and unit cost. The objective of price discrimination is to maximize profit in
                          a situation where different customers have different willingness to pay. It may also be
                          less costly to serve certain customer segments, such as large-volume buyers.
                              Rather than changing list or published prices, companies often implement pricing
                          strategies using variable discounting, promotions, and bundles. For example, a cus-
                          tomer may be offered a discount that other customers are not offered, and companies
                          may adjust prices by changing the generosity of promotions rather than changing list
                          prices. Prices adjusted for these are typically referred to as net prices.
                              Common pricing models include the following:
                              ■   Tiered pricing: Charging different prices to different buyers, often based
                                  on volume purchased but also based on product features (e.g., base versus
                                  premium trims of vehicles)
                              ■   Dynamic pricing: Charging different prices at different times and for dif-
                                  ferent types of customers depending on such variables as available supply
                                  levels and demand. Specific examples include seasonal pricing for hotels,
                                  where prices may be high in the summer for beachfront properties and low
                                  in the winter, and surge pricing by ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft, in
                                  which prices are raised in periods of exceptionally high demand.
                              ■   Value-based pricing: Setting prices based on the value received by the
                                  customer, which often involves estimating opportunity cost. This approach
                                  is commonly attempted in pharmaceuticals, where, for example, the price of
                                  a new drug that reduces the risk of stroke by 33% would reflect the savings
                                  from avoided hospitalization and death. Such an approach leads to different
                                  prices for different drugs since drugs vary in effectiveness and the type of
                                  disease they treat, and the prices of hospitalizations, physician services, and
                                  so on, that may be avoided from their use also vary by country.
                              ■   Auction/reverse auction models: These models establish prices through a
                                  bidding process. Digital technology enables this process to be automated,
                                  making these models feasible in new categories (e.g., Google and Baidu for
                                  digital advertising and eBay for consumer merchandise).
                              Some pricing models are used by firms selling multiple or complex products:

       incremental profit margins and high marketing costs relative to the cost of
       the product itself. Examples include phone, cable TV, and internet services
       or application software with cloud-based storage.
   ■   Razor, razorblade pricingcombines a low price on an initial purchase of
       equipment (e.g., razor, printer, gaming console, diagnostic equipment) with
       high-margin prices on repeat-purchase consumables associated with the
       equipment (razorblades, printer ink, games, reagents). Often, companies
       design the equipment to work only with their proprietary consumables.
       Other companies selling generic consumables can render this pricing model
       unprofitable.
   ■   Add-on pricing applies when a customer buys additional but optional ser-
       vices or product features, either at the time of purchase or during product
       use. A common strategy is to seek profitable pricing on the add-on when
       the customer is “captive” after the initial purchase decision has been made,
       such as in-game or in-app purchases of content and features. Firms that
       take this strategy too far, however, can damage customer goodwill and their
       reputation.
    Businesses that seek to expand their footprint quickly may select an approach in
which they use penetration pricing, or discounting willingly to build scale and mar-
ket share, albeit at the cost of margins. It can be thought of as effectively a marketing
expense to acquire customers. Examples include mobile phone providers discount-
ing smartphones and Amazon discounting its Alexa-enabled tablets, e-readers, and
speakers. However, penetration pricing can be controversial if implemented for a
long period, because regulators may see the practice as unfair or anti-competitive and
investors may question when or if the company will achieve profitability.
    For digital businesses, growing a user base is often a critical objective, since the
incremental costs associated with one more customer subscription are often minimal
and the benefits can be enormous, including promotion through word of mouth and,
potentially, network effects. Trial and adoption can be encouraged through pricing
strategies that include the following:
   ■   The pricing in a freemium business model allows customers a certain level
       of usage or functionality at no charge or with ads, for example with news
       content, a software application, or a game. This model is widely used in digi-
       tal services with network effects when the company is seeking to scale up.
   ■   A hidden revenue business model provides services to users at no charge
       and generates revenues elsewhere. This is a common feature of both legacy
       and digital business models in the media sector, with “free” content and paid
       advertising. Examples can also be found in online marketplaces, where sell-
       ers pay and buyers do not, and financial services with debit cards, checking
       accounts, and security trading that appear free.
    Some business models create value by providing an alternative to ownership and
provide use of the product without purchasing an asset or product. The simplicity of
electronic invoicing and payments and the value that businesses and investors place
on predictable, recurring revenue streams have driven the introduction of subscription
pricing models in new areas.
   ■   Subscriptions deliver products or services—or access to them—in exchange
       for recurring fees. Traditionally, the subscription model is associated with
       media and utilities. However, subscription models have been extended
       broadly to many sectors, notably application software and cloud computing

                                           infrastructure. Subscription fees can be fixed, discounted for promotional
                                           offers, tiered according to features, or based on customer usage, such as in
                                           utilities, payment processing, and cloud computing.
                                       ■   Leasing, licensing, and franchising, while all different, are also all like sub-
                                           scriptions but involve the transfer of property or access to it rather than a
                                           product. Leasing is typically used when the property is real estate or another
                                           physical asset, licensing is for intellectual property, and franchising is a
                                           more comprehensive form of licensing, in which the franchisor typically
                                           gives the franchisee the right to sell or distribute its product or service in a
                                           specified territory and to receive marketing and other support. Specifics on
                                           these important but complicated forms of recurring-revenue models will be

                                   The Value Proposition (Who + What + Where + How Much)
                                   A value proposition refers to the product or service attributes valued by customers
                                   that lead them to purchase the product and prefer one firm’s offering over those of
                                   its competitors, given relative pricing. These vary greatly and relate to factors such
                                   as the following:
                                       ■   Product and service itself—its capability, performance, features, and style
                                       ■   Service and support behind the product and service—whether it is
                                           “high-touch” or “low-touch” customer service, depending on the require-
                                           ments of the customer and the type of product or service, access to repairs,
                                           spare parts, and so on
                                       ■   Sale process (e.g., purchasing convenience, no-hassle returns)
                                       ■   The pricing relative to competitors
                                       Crafting a compelling value proposition requires management to carefully consider
                                   these factors. For instance, Tesla’s value proposition goes beyond transportation: It
                                   emphasizes the benefits of its electric propulsion system, zero emissions, and high
                                   performance with strong and silent acceleration, as well as technological sophistica-
                                   tion, including self-driving capabilities and other enhancements via ongoing software
                                   upgrades. Additionally, an important part of Tesla’s value proposition is its proprietary
                                   network of high-speed charging stations. It is a major undertaking for Tesla to build
                                   this network in multiple countries, but doing so can provide a competitive advantage
                                   against market entrants. Finally, Tesla has engendered significant customer loyalty
                                   from the aesthetics of its vehicles, the personality of its founder, and word-of-mouth
                                   marketing from customers and online influencers.

​




         Each of these business models is valid for its respective customer segment.
    Both require distribution to disparate customer bases. However, Model A (low-
    priced kits) could potentially be established at a smaller scale online or by gaining
    shelf space at a handful of large retailers.
         With Model A, the challenge will be to have a low-enough product cost to
    generate an acceptable margin for the business. Differentiation against other
    kit providers might be also achievable through better online customer reviews,
    product aesthetics, a better selection of tools, or perhaps an extra feature not
    offered by competitors—for example, by bundling with a selection of common
    fasteners, aimed at maximizing customer convenience at a low price point.
         With Model B, the more critical factor is likely to be product quality, price,
    and distribution. The professional market requires tools that are of demonstrably
    high quality so that their customers, who are knowledgeable, will choose them
    over established rival brands. This might be difficult for a new brand, such as HD.
    However, HD might be able to overcome this, with objective statements about
    the quality of materials used in making the tools, their strength and durability, a
    lifetime warranty and generous return policy, marketing aimed at professionals,
    and working with specialist retailers to promote the product.

   Businesses can be constrained in their value proposition by regulations, customers
that prioritize price above all other factors, or the firm selling a commodity product
with thin margins.


Business Organization and Capabilities
Evaluating a firm’s business model requires consideration not only of the value
proposition but also “how” the firm is structured to deliver. Specifically, what labor
and capital resources, relationships, intellectual property, and other capabilities and
assets does the firm require to execute on its business model, and will the firm need
to own them or can they be contracted for. If a firm is dependent on other firms for
critical inputs, those supplier relationships can become key elements of its strategy
and a potential risk.

                             Both a Key Supplier and Competitor
                             Netflix, the digital entertainment company, sells a streaming video service through
                             its website and mobile applications. While it produces and licenses content, it
                             relies on the services provided by internet service providers, such as broadband
                             and wireless telecom companies, to reach its customers. Additionally, Netflix
                             relies on digital infrastructure companies to enable the delivery of content to its
                             more than 200 million subscribers globally whenever and wherever they want.
                             One digital infrastructure company is Amazon, which, through its Prime Video
                             streaming service, is also a significant competitor for Netflix.
                                 In its annual report, Netflix noted the following under its risk factors:

                                 “Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastruc-
                                 ture platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a
                                 “cloud” computing service. We have architected our software and computer
                                 systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services
                                 provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on
                                 AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS
                                 operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with
                                 our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be
                                 adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we
                                 do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner
                                 as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to
                                 do so, it could harm our business.”

                               The auto business has traditionally been organized with automakers supplied by
                          networks of parts manufacturers. Parts manufacturers might supply very specific
                          components, such as tires, or complete assemblies, such engines. There is generally
                          a very close relationship between automakers and their suppliers because parts or
                          assemblies are often custom designed for a particular vehicle. When the supplier
                          becomes involved at the design stage and throughout the production stage, it improves
                          quality and interoperability, though specificity of parts increases reliance on single
                          manufacturers and the risk of supply interruptions. For instance, in the wake of the
                          COVID-19 pandemic, undersupply of some semiconductor inputs resulted in signif-
                          icant supply disruptions and lost sales for automakers. In some cases, automakers
                          outsource vehicle production entirely, as in the case of Porsche outsourcing to Valmet
                          and Magna Steyr.
                               Tesla’s business model is different because it emphasizes vertical integration, with
                          in-house development and production of key components, such as batteries and
                          software/electronics. This requires substantial capital and effort and is therefore an
                          unusual choice for a new company but is consistent with Tesla’s strategy of propri-
                          etary technology.
                               The “how” aspect of a business model is also referred to as a firm’s value chain—that
                          is, the systems and processes in a firm that create value for its customers. The value
                          chain includes only those functions performed by a single firm, including functions
                          that are valued by customers but may not involve physical transformation or handling
                          the product. Note that a firm’s value chain is different from its supply chain, which
                          refers to the sequence of processes involved in the creation of a product, both within
                          and external to a firm. A supply chain includes all the steps involved in producing and
                          delivering a physical product to the end customer, regardless of whether those steps

Defining the Business Model                                                                      227


are performed by a single firm. For businesses, where marketing and sales are strate-
gically critical functions, the “value proposition” includes the channels used to reach
customers, the value the firm might deliver through the sales and service functions.
    Value chain analysis provides a link between the firm’s value proposition for cus-
tomers and its profitability, as Exhibit 4 shows, and was originally conceptualized by
Porter in 1985.

                                      Primary Activities




These activities are core to each firm, and the extent and significance each of these
roles play in the day-to-day activities of firms depend on the scale of the business
and its operations. Additionally, the firm’s four primary “support” activities include
procurement, human resource management, technology development, and firm
infrastructure. This provides a useful starting point for evaluating the value chain of a
company, although dramatic advances in digital technology have radically changed the
way that some of these functions are carried out in many businesses. When analyzing
the value chain, each component should be evaluated by first identifying the specific
activities carried out by the firm, then estimating the value added and costs associated
with each activity, and finally identifying opportunities for competitive advantage.
    Finally, a business model should reveal how the firm expects to generate a profit.
That is, how and why prices and volumes not only cover but exceed variable and
fixed costs today or in the future at a greater scale. An analyst will want to examine
margins, break-even points, and unit economics, which expresses revenues and costs
on a per-unit basis. For example, Amazon Web Services and the cloud infrastructure
business model is based on a decline over time in both unit costs and unit prices as
volumes increase and technology improves. This would be expected to create a virtuous
cycle: Lower prices enable cloud computing providers to expand customers and usage,
which in turn lowers costs because most costs are fixed; in fact, unit costs fall faster
than prices, so profits increase. Overall, this is a considerable barrier to competition,
because a new entrant that matched the prevailing price would suffer losses because
they did not have the economies of scale to have low costs.
    In summary, a business model answers several key questions:
    ■    What is the firm selling?
    ■    To whom?
    ■    For how much?

                           QUESTION SET

                             An analyst is evaluating two bicycle manufacturing companies: Winston
                             Bikes and Carbondash.
                                 Winston Bikes manufactures inexpensive, mass-market bicycles and sells
                             them through a variety of physical retailers. It uses the latest in robotic tech-
                             nology to do its manufacturing, and it leases the robotic equipment under an
                             arrangement where it can easily increase or decrease the amount of equipment
                             it uses. It uses conventional, established, common, and simple designs and uses
                             materials that are inexpensive and widely available.
                                 Carbondash produces premium, high-quality, complex bicycles by hand. Its
                             technicians are highly trained over long periods of time and are under long-term
                             employment contracts. It uses unconventional, sophisticated, highly precise
                             designs. It manufactures its frames with a proprietary and highly specialized
                             variant of carbon fiber that is infused with a rare earth metal that is available
                             from only one mine in the world. Everything is custom measured and custom fit
                             to the rider by highly trained salespeople in retail outlets located in expensive,
                             prestigious physical locations. It serves a loyal customer base that is relatively
                             insensitive to price.

                             1. If a sudden change in market demand happens, which company will be bet-
                                ter able to handle it?
                                  Guideline solution:
                                  If there is a sudden change in market demand, whether an increase or a de-
                                  crease in demand, Winston Bikes will most likely be able to handle it better
                                  than Carbondash. Because of Winston Bikes’ flexible lease arrangements
                                  with its manufacturing robots, it can easily scale its manufacturing up or
                                  down in response to changes in market demand. Carbondash, however, has
                                  a heavy dependence on skilled human labor. It can’t scale up quickly because
                                  its technicians require long periods of training, and it can’t scale down easily
                                  because of its long-term labor contracts.

                             2. Why might the risks of supplier disruption be lower for Winston Bikes than
                                for Carbondash?
                                  Guideline solution:
                                  Carbondash faces higher risk of supplier disruption because it single-sourc-
                                  es its materials from one company, uses a proprietary design that requires
                                  specialized manufacturing techniques, and uses a special ingredient that is
                                  available from only one source in the world. Winston Bikes, in contrast, uses
                                  many suppliers and has simple designs and widely available materials that
                                  can be used by many suppliers.

                             3. Why might the risks of increases in material costs be lower for Carbondash
                                than for Winston Bikes?
                                  Guideline solution:
                                  Winston Bikes is a low-cost business that competes on price and has thin
                                  margins. It is a price taker and so is unable to raise its prices without suf-
                                  fering a decrease in sales. Its thin margins mean that it can’t absorb cost

Defining the Business Model                                                             229


     increases and remain profitable. Carbondash, in contrast, relies on differen-
     tiation of its products and has a loyal customer base that is less sensitive to
     price. Because its margins are higher, it is better able to absorb an increase
     in the cost of its materials, and because its customer base is loyal and less
     sensitive to price, it is able to raise its prices without a significant adverse
     impact on its sales.

  4. Which company will most likely:

      a. be larger?
      b. have higher prices?
     c. have higher costs?
     Guideline solution to a:
     Winston Bikes will most likely be larger than Carbondash, at least in terms
     of units sold. Winston Bikes operates on thin margins and so must have a
     high volume in order to generate sufficient profitability to survive. Carbon-
     dash, in contrast, is likely a high-price, low-volume manufacturer. Winston
     Bikes has omnichannel distribution, which puts its products in front of
     more customers. Carbondash uses direct sales in physical stores using sales-
     people to create relationships.
     Guideline solution to b:
     Carbondash will most likely have higher prices. It pursues a product dif-
     ferentiation strategy, and it targets a customer base that is relatively price
     insensitive. Winston Bikes competes on price and so must have low prices.
     Guideline solution to c:
     Carbondash most likely has higher costs per unit because of all the human
     labor involved throughout the manufacturing and sales process. The bikes
     are assembled by hand and are sold using direct sales in its own stores with
     its own sales staff. Winston Bikes uses the latest in software and robot man-
     ufacturing technology in order to keep costs as low as possible, and it uses
     distribution channels whereby it doesn’t need to pay for stores or sales staff.

  5. An analyst sits down for a meeting with the management team of Luggo
     Corporation, who is describing their business. The CEO makes the following
     statement:

     Luggo makes premium parts to secure wheels onto cars and trucks. We
     differentiate ourselves from our competitors by using premium designs and
     building our products from the finest titanium to ensure strength and light
     weight. We distribute our products through wholesalers that supply physical
     retail stores, and we price at parity with the market.

     What parts of the business model did the CEO not describe?
     Guideline solution:
     The CEO did not describe the firm’s customers. This is one of the key attri-
     butes of a business model and describes how the firm segments its customer
     base and which segments it is targeting with its products. Customers can be
     segmented in numerous ways, including by their geography, demographics,
     seasonal or life-cycle timing, behavior, social group, and wealth. Segment-
     ing allows companies to identify customer cohorts across geographies and
     combine them into larger homogeneous markets that are easier to access
     and penetrate using targeted marketing. Business opportunities often arise

                                  because established firms may not effectively serve—or even recognize—
                                  customer segments.




              3           BUSINESS MODEL TYPES

                                         describe various types of business models



                          Conventional Business Models
                          Some business models are common and have existed for a long time. Alone or in com-
                          bination with one another, these conventional models make up most business models
                          in practice and are thus essential for analysts to understand. We briefly describe eight
                          conventional models in Exhibit 5 using the framework in the prior lesson. In practice,
                          each industry sector tends to have its own version of these conventional models, with
                          specific features, such as “athletic apparel manufacturer.”


                          Business Model Variations
                          While the conventional business models are enough to describe many companies,
                          there are many others in practice. Most of them are simply combinations of the con-
                          ventional models or industry-specific variations.
                              ■    Private label or contract manufacturers that produce goods to be mar-
                                   keted by others. This is a common arrangement, particularly for offshore
                                   production. Apple and NVIDIA, for example, do not manufacture their own
                                   branded products but instead contract with many specialized contract man-
                                   ufacturers in Asia. Apple and NIVIDIA manage a web of complex relation-
                                   ships, while specializing in R&D, product design, and sales and marketing.
                              ■    Value added resellers not only distribute a product but also handle more
                                   complex aspects of product installation, customization, service, or support.
                                   This is common with complex, service-intensive products, such as construc-
                                   tion machinery, IT hardware, and enterprise software.
                              ■    Licensing arrangements in which a company will produce a product using
                                   someone else’s brand name in return for a royalty: This is common in toys
                                   and apparel, for example, when manufacturers might pay for the right to
                                   use the name of a famous film character, a sports team, or a brand that has
                                   become popular in a related category, such as sporting goods.
                              ■    Franchise models in which franchisees have a tightly defined and exclusive
                                   relationship with a franchisor to operate under a specific brand with propri-
                                   etary products and processes. Restaurants, retailers, and auto dealerships
                                   are common types of franchises. The franchisor earns a royalty on the fran-
                                   chisee’s sales. The franchisor is responsible for product development and
                                   advertising, for which it often collects an additional fee from franchisees.

Business Model Innovation
Most discussion of business models focuses on innovation: how new business models
can be introduced or adapted to existing markets. While not requiring it, business
model innovation is often combined with technological innovation and pioneered by
new market entrants rather than industry incumbents.
   Exhibit 6 identifies several historical cases of business model innovations in various
industries. Notice how innovation becomes convention over time.

Digital technology has generated many new products, such as streaming video, digi-
tal advertising, social media, and dating apps and has enabled many business model
innovations, such as digital marketplaces. While large-scale business model innovation
did not start with digital technology, the rapid and open-ended advance of digital
technology has dramatically changed how businesses operate by radically reducing
the cost of communicating, exchanging information, and financially transacting. This
had several direct implications for many businesses:
    ■      Location matters less. Digital communications and e-commerce enable
           customers to shop and purchase more easily from firms having no local
           physical presence.
    ■      Outsourcing is easier, for similar reasons.
    ■      Digital marketing makes it easy and cost effective to reach very specific
           groups of customers, regardless of location, and to engage more deeply with
           them than was possible with traditional advertising.
    ■      Network effects, discussed next, have become more powerful and accessible
           to more firms.


Network Effects and Platform Business Models
Network effects refer to the increase in value of a network to its users as more users
join. Many internet-based businesses are built on network effects; for example, China’s
WeChat messaging and payment platform is valuable to its users in large part because

                          it is used by so many people. Once it achieved a high enough number of users, it also
                          became available to marginal users, further increasing user growth. Online classifieds,
                          social media, and ride-sharing services are other examples. Network effects capitalize
                          on both economics of scale and scope. Network effects are also at work in many older,
                          pre-internet businesses, such as telephone service, payment systems including credit
                          cards, and financial infrastructure, such as stock exchanges. In all these businesses,
                          the key metric is the number of users and the growth rate of users.
                               “One-sided” network effects apply in networks where it is only one type of user that
                          is valuable to other users: for example, telephone services and peer-to-peer payment
                          systems, such as Venmo, a mobile app owned by PayPal that enables users to easily
                          transfer, deposit, and withdraw money. Connections between users are crucial, but
                          there is one type of user. Depending on the size and the connections of the network,
                          the marginal cost of acquiring each additional user is lower than the revenue generated
                          by adding the user to the network.
                               In some cases, networks are composed of two or more types of users, which can
                          be described as “two-sided” or “multi-sided” networks, such as buyers and sellers in
                          an online marketplace. The typical example for these multi-sided platforms includes
                          credit and debit card networks, such as Visa and China Union Pay, composed of both
                          merchant and cardholder users. Other examples include digital marketplaces, such as
                          Airbnb, composed of both hosts and guests. As these multi-sided networks grow—
                          more users join the service, which attracts more merchants, which in turn attracts
                          more users—these businesses can grow exponentially. The growth of food delivery
                          services connects restaurants, independent drivers, and customers and has evolved
                          through multiple interdependent network effects. As each of the three groups has
                          grown, they in turn increase the aggregate size of their networks, as Exhibit 7 shows.
                          Network effects create strong barriers to entry and are a form of competitive advantage.

                          Network business models often include crowdsourcing, where users contribute directly

                          Reddit; open-source software; knowledge aggregators, such as Wikipedia; and cus-

                          businesses facilitate “user communities” that enable voluntary collaboration between
                          users of a product with a small amount of moderation and oversight by the company.

    EXAMPLE 7

      Business Model Evolution in the Hotel and Travel Industry
      The hotel industry provides a good illustration of business model evolution over
      time and the emergence of different business models, with varying financial
      characteristics. Until the 20th century, business model evolution was slow. In
      response to increasing scale and specialization demanded by a growing market,
      hotels became larger and more numerous but with little change in the basic
      business model. The 20th century brought major changes to business models in
      the industry. The single-property hotel business remained a relevant business
      model, due to the inherent uniqueness of certain hotel properties.
          However, with a much larger and highly mobile customer base, hotel operators
      saw an opportunity, with the need to serve a growing corporate travel market,
      increase the scale and footprint of their businesses, and provide convenience
      and consistency to customers, thereby increasing operating efficiency. Some
      specific examples are outlined below.

                           travelers
​




          The digital transformation of business models has also impacted the hotel
      business. To increase the efficiency in marketing and distribution of hotel and
      travel-related services, Online Travel Agency (OTA) reducedthe complexities
      of travel planning and bookings. In both its traditional and online forms, the
      travel agency business is a two-sided network.
          Like a traditional travel agent, OTA assists travelers with research and
      planning, price comparisons, bookings, and logistics. For hotels, it provides
      exposure, leads, bookings, customer information, feedback, and competitive
      intelligence. Automating these functions and delivering them as a web-based
      service so greatly improved their convenience, speed, and efficiency that the
      business model was transformed, shifting the relationship and the balance of
      power between agencies and their hotel customers. Effectively, through network

                                        Hotel operators have responded to these challenges by investing in their
                                    own websites, customer data, and direct booking capabilities or selling directly
                                    to various sites. Some traditional hotel chains, which have historically empha-
                                    sized consistency and uniformity, have launched so-called soft brands, which
                                    are hotels that operate under their own name but with a greater degree of local
                                    operator autonomy. Moreover, they have created hybrid hotel solutions, such
                                    as condo-hotels (condos in a hotel that are at the disposal of the owner but are
                                    rented out otherwise by the hotel).


                                  QUESTION SET

                                    Bynta is a new entrant in the retail clothing industry. It is competing
                                    against Ocean Hill Inc., an established industry incumbent that uses
                                    a conventional business model.

                                    1. What attributes of a conventional retail business model will Bynta and
                                       Ocean Hill Inc. likely share?
                                       Solution:
                                       The four major components of a business model framework are custom-
                                       ers, products, channels, and pricing. Bynta and Ocean Hill Inc. will likely
                                       be similar in that their customers will be end users of the products, their
                                       products will be finished goods, and their pricing will be based on markup
                                       on products sold.

                                    2. What most likely would distinguish Bynta from Ocean Hill Inc.?
                                       Solution:
                                       Bynta can distinguish itself from Ocean Hill Inc. by using digital technology
                                       to reduce the cost of communicating, exchanging information, and finan-
                                       cially transacting. With digital technology, location matters less because
                                       e-commerce allows for shopping and purchasing without the need for a
                                       physical storefront.
                                       Outsourcing to private label or contract manufacturers is also made easi-
                                       er with digital technology and will allow Bynta to focus more on product
                                       design, sales, and marketing.

     Improved customer segmentation is also enabled by digital technology,
     allowing for segments that are narrower and unique to Bynta’s product
     categories. Digital technology in marketing will make it easier and more
     cost effective for Bynta to reach very specific customer segments, regard-
     less of location, and to engage more deeply with them than is possible with
     traditional advertising. Sophisticated market analytics can be used to break
     out smaller, homogeneous markets. This will allow Bynta to identify cus-
     tomer cohorts across geographies and combine them into larger homoge-
     neous markets that are easier to access and penetrate using targeted digital
     advertising.
     Bynta can also benefit from network effects and crowdsourcing by facili-
     tating user communities that enable voluntary collaboration between its
     customers.

  3. Given an increase in the price of raw materials/commodities, what is the dif-
     ference in revenue/profit impact for producers versus manufacturers versus
     distributors and retailers?
     Solution:
     A supply chain includes all the steps involved in producing and delivering a
     physical product to the end customer, regardless of whether those steps are
     performed by a single firm. Different firms at different points in the supply
     chain may attempt to mitigate the impact of raw materials/commodity price
     increases in different ways. Some firms may try to stabilize revenues by
     entering long-term customer or hedging contracts.
     While these are often available for firms at the beginning of the supply
     chain, where there are established markets for contracts on raw materials, it
     is less possible further down the chain. For example, producers that sell nat-
     ural resources or commodities and manufacturers that buy them can enter
     derivative contracts in the forward markets to secure more stable pricing for
     the products they sell or the key inputs that they need.
     Further down the supply chain, distributors and retailers may secure long-
     term contracts to ensure stabilized prices, though they are unlikely to have
     access to structured and highly liquid derivative contracts. The manufactur-
     ing stage of the supply chain creates products that are too differentiated to
     support broad derivative markets as there are with commodities.
     One risk is that if a firm locks in a sale price for its products while not
     locking in a purchase price for its raw material key inputs, it faces the risk of
     substantial loss if the cost of raw materials increases in the spot market.
     Some firms may attempt to minimize fixed operating costs—for example,
     through outsourcing or flexible contracts with workers and suppliers.
     Firms whose revenue/profit may be impacted by fluctuations in materials
     prices may also use more conservative capital structure policies, with rela-
     tively little debt and therefore smaller fixed financing obligations compared
     with firms that are less sensitive to such fluctuations.

  Questions 4 and 5 expand on the earlier example of business model evolu-
  tion in the hotel and travel industry.

  4. Describe the differences in features between the hotel business model and
     the home-sharing business model.
     Solution:
     Many hotels use a franchise model in which franchisees have a tightly de-
     fined and exclusive relationship with a franchisor to operate under a specific

                                brand with proprietary products and processes. The franchisor earns a
                                royalty on the franchisee’s sales.
                                Homesharing follows an Online Travel Agency (OTA) business model
                                and has challenged and disrupted the traditional hotel model by enabling

                             5. Explain why there might be so many fewer OTA companies than hotel
                                companies.
                                Solution:
                                One reason why there might be so many fewer OTA companies than hotel
                                companies is that OTA companies are aggregators that benefit much more
                                from network effects than hotel companies. “Network effects” refers to the
                                exponential increase in value to a network’s users as the number of its users
                                grows. A large network is valuable to its users in large part because it is used
                                by so many people. As more users join the network, more merchants are
                                attracted to the network, which in turn attracts more users. Hence, there are
                                fewer OTA companies and each one attracts many users.
                                Network business models also often include crowdsourcing, where users
                                contribute directly to a product or service. These businesses facilitate “user
                                communities” that enable voluntary collaboration between users of a prod-
                                uct via customer reviews and feedback and require only a small amount of
                                moderation and oversight by the company.

The following information relates to questions
2-5
   An analyst is reviewing investor presentations from the management teams of
   two companies with unconventional business models: HealthyPet and DiaSera.
   HealthyPet is a pet medical insurer that has a differentiated approach in a
   business dominated by incumbent property & casualty insurers, for which pet
   insurance is a niche business relative to business, home, and auto insurance lines.
   HealthyPet targets the high-income, young, urban, busy professional pet owner
   segment. It bundles coverage for owners of multiple pets, including exotic pets
   that incumbents are typically reluctant to insure. The industry incumbents sell
   insurance policies that reimburse pet owners for a percentage of veterinarian
   and other medical costs incurred, subject to restrictions and limits. HealthyPet,
   however, pays veterinarians directly for pet medical costs. It has a preferred net-
   work of veterinarians it recommends and for which it negotiates lower prices, but
   policyholders face relatively few restrictions. It sells through veterinarian refer-
   rals and boutique pet stores to maintain an image of exclusivity and prestige and
   maintains an online storefront for customer convenience. It avoids mass market
   retail to protect its image. It charges more than its competitors for monthly
   insurance premiums because it is a better product. The pricing has worked so far
   because HealthyPet has a strong brand and a distinctiveness that its customers
   value.
   DiaSera designs, makes, and sells a medical device that delivers insulin to people
   with insulin-dependent diabetes known as an insulin pump. DiaSera’s pump is
   differentiated from those of its competitors in its design and operation; it is far
   smaller and more aesthetically pleasing than competitors’ pumps. It is a sin-
   gle, small device adhered to a user’s skin, while competitors’ pumps consist of
   separate handheld controllers attached to a delivery device on a user’s skin with
   tubing.
   Insulin pumps are used primarily by people with Type 1 diabetes, which is a
   smaller market that has complex medical needs, including close management of
   insulin. The insulin pump market is complex, with several competitors; comple-
   ment products, such as insulin monitoring devices; and an inexpensive substi-
   tute: using multiple daily injections of insulin.
   DiaSera is looking to expand its customer reach to include Type 2 diabetics who
   are on multiple daily insulin injections, which is a market several times the size of
   the Type 1 diabetics market. DiaSera’s pump product is priced at a small premi-
   um to competitors. Management says that given significant economies of scale in
   manufacturing, unit costs will fall substantially as the customer base grows and,

                              even with unchanged pricing, margins will rise significantly. Besides the differen-
                              tiated product design, the company also offers substantial customer service from
                              highly trained nurses both before and after the sale. Access to customer service is
                              available 24/7 and does not have any additional cost to the customer.
                              DiaSera makes direct sales to customers and markets to both customers and
                              physicians, because customers must receive a prescription for the pump from a
                              physician before purchase. Products are shipped directly to customers’ homes.

     SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. A company’s supply chain is the network or system inside and out-
   side the company involved in producing a product or service and delivering it to
   an end user.
   A is incorrect because value chain refers to the systems and processes within
   a firm that create value for its customers. It is the “how” aspect of a business
   model.
   C is incorrect because the business model is a description of how a business
   works. It includes descriptions of the core customer base, the product or service
   that the business offers, the key resources and assets the business uses, and the
   main partners and suppliers of the business.

4. There are several apparent risks to HealthyPet’s business model. It is not clear
   that their offering is sufficiently differentiated to build a large-enough customer
   base to provide the diversification that an insurance company depends on (insur-
   ance requires a large pool of policyholders such that there is enough premiums
   to cover losses). It may incur an adverse selection problem in covering exotic
   pets because they may be uneconomical to insure as evidenced by the reluctance
   of established companies to insure them. Finally, if its model is successful, it will
   likely face competition in the form of imitators, possibly from the incumbent
   insurers because it is probably possible for them to copy the model of pay veteri-
   narians directly.
   HealthyPet could see opportunity in building a loyal base of customers and a loy-
   al base of veterinarians. Its image of prestige, premium service, and not needing

                              to worry when a pet gets sick could appeal to many pet owners.
                              Questions include how difficult it would be for other insurers to copy the busi-
                              ness model, how HealthyPet plans to establish relationships with veterinarians
                              and how many it has and needs, and whether relationships with veterinarians
                              can be exclusive. It is also questionable whether referrals and boutique pet stores
                              will deliver a sufficient flow of new customers to support the business or whether
                              HealthyPet will instead need to invest in large advertising campaigns directly to
                              consumers.

                          5. A major risk is the possible incompatibility between DiaSera’s pricing strategy
                             and its emphasis on customer service. It is priced only slightly higher than parity
                             with competitors but aims to provide substantially better customer service by
                             using highly trained experts. If customer growth and sales disappoint or take
                             longer than expected, the economies of scale in manufacturing will as well, po-
                             tentially imperiling profitability or forcing management to raise prices. A second
                             major risk is targeting Type 2 diabetics who have historically not used insulin
                             pumps. While DiaSera’s insulin pump seems more convenient than multiple daily
                             injections of insulin, it is more expensive and requires customers to navigate a
                             potentially complicated prescription, purchasing, and service scenario. DiaSera
                             management should discuss key factors that give it confidence in the strategy—
                             such as a segment of customers in the Type 2 market who have tried a pump
                             before, patients who are younger and more likely to try a new product—and
                             establish relationships with key physicians who can recommend the product to
                             patients.
                             The clear major opportunities are market share gains in Type 1 diabetes from
                             inferior competitor products and the new market opportunity of Type 2 dia-
                             betics who require multiple daily injections. If competitors have not segmented
                             the market to explicitly target this cohort, DiaSera could realize a competitive
                             advantage.
                             Key questions include details on its manufacturing strategy, such as estimat-
                             ing unit costs or gross margins at different levels of volume, how experienced
                             the manufacturing management and staff are in this setting, to what extent the
                             company owns the manufacturing resources, and whether there are key suppliers
                             it relies on. Additionally, an analyst will have to develop an outlook for market
                             penetration and sales based on customer segmenting, historical data, precedent
                             product launches, and realistic expectations for customer demand at the current
                             price point. Finally, additional details on how many service professionals are
                             needed per number of customers and at what cost will be essential to modeling
                             operating costs.
