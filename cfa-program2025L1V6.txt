                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page

    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.

INTRODUCTION
Fixed-income instruments, such as loans and bonds, are the most common means of
                                                                                        1
financing. Fixed-income issuers include businesses, governments, and not-for-profits
that promise to pay interest and repay borrowed principal to investors. Loans are
commonly used between an individual or company and a bank. Bonds are more stan-
dardized fixed-income instruments designed to be more easily tradeable than loans
and are commonly issued by larger companies, governments, and special purpose
issuers. Bonds are a core holding for many investors, including mutual funds, pension
plans, insurance companies, and central banks. This module introduces the features
of fixed-income instruments and the legal contracts that govern them.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Fixed-income instruments are debt instruments, such as loans
          and bonds, that represent a contractual agreement under
          which an issuer borrows money from investors in exchange for inter-
          est and future repayment of principal.
      ■   Key features of fixed-income instruments include the issuer (bor-
          rower), time to maturity, principal amount, coupon rate and fre-
          quency, seniority, and contingency provisions. These features in turn
          define the cash flow structure of the instrument.
      ■   A fixed-income investor (lender) receives a return or yield based on
          the periodic cash flows paid by the bond issuer and the change in price
          of the bond. A bond’s price and yield vary inversely with one another.

4   Learning Module 1                                                      Fixed-Income Instrument Features


                               ■   Fixed-income investors are exposed to credit risk, the risk of loss
                                   resulting from the issuer failing to make full and timely payments of
                                   interest and/or to repay principal. Investors expect to earn the lowest
                                   yield on bonds that carry little or no credit risk and expect higher
                                   yields on lower-credit-quality instruments.
                               ■   A fixed-income instrument’s credit quality is affected by the underly-
                                   ing source of repayment, its seniority, credit provisions such as collat-
                                   eral backing, and the issuer’s willingness to pay.
                               ■   The legal contract describing the features and other terms of a
                                   fixed-income security is known as an indenture.
                               ■   Indentures often contain covenants, or legally enforceable terms,
                                   agreed to at the time of issuance. These may either require the bond
                                   issuer to take an action or prohibit the issuer from performing some
                                   action.



                         LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. The annual coupon amount for a fixed-rate bond is calculated by:
                              A. multiplying its yield by the par value of the bond.
                              B. Multiplying its coupon rate by the price of the bond.
                               C. Multiplying its coupon rate by the par value of the bond.
                              Solution:
                              C is correct. On each interest payment date, a fixed-rate bond issuer pays
                              investors a coupon payment equal to the bond’s coupon rate times its par
                              value. For periods shorter than a year, the annual coupon amount is divided
                              into smaller equal periodic payments. For example, a bond with a par value
                              of 100 and a coupon rate of 6% paid quarterly would pay coupon payments
                              of 0.06 × 100 = 60/4 = 15 four times per year.

                           2. Match each bond type in the left column with a description in the right
                              column.
                                                                     ​




                            A. Fixed-coupon bond      I. The difference between its issuance price and par
                                                      value at maturity represents a cumulative interest pay-
                                                      ment at maturity.
                            B. Floating-rate note     II. Usually involves uniform payments that occur at
                                                      monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual intervals.
                            C. Zero-coupon bond       III. Involves interest payments that reset periodically
                                                      based on market factors.
                                                                     ​




                              Solution:

                              A. II is correct. Fixed-coupon bonds usually involve uniform payments
                                 that occur at monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual intervals.
                              B. III is correct. Floating-rate notes (FRNs) involve interest payments that
                                 reset periodically based on market factors.

Introduction                                                                           5


      C. I is correct. Zero-coupon bonds are typically issued at a discount to
         par; the difference between the issuance price and par value represents
         a cumulative interest payment at maturity.

  3. The coupon rate for a floating rate note (FRN) is composed of a market
     reference rate and:
      A. a credit rating.
      B. an issuer-specific spread.
      C. The yield on a fixed-rate benchmark bond.
     Solution:
     B is correct. An FRN coupon rate comprises a market reference rate (MRR)
     and an issuer-specific spread that is usually constant and set at the time
     of issuance, while the MRR resets periodically based on market factors.
     As the MRR changes, the FRN coupon rate and interest payment change
     accordingly.
     A is incorrect. While the issuer’s credit rating may be a determinant of an
     FRN’s spread over the MRR, a credit rating is a letter-grade assessment of
     credit risk and is not directly involved in the calculation of the coupon rate.
     C is incorrect. The yield on a fixed-rate benchmark bond would reflect top-
     down factors that determine interest rates, such as real growth and expected
     inflation, which are already considered in the MRR.

  4. A sovereign bond is usually a safer investment than a corporate bond of
     similar maturity issued within a country because:
      A. corporate bonds are subject to inflation risk.
      B. sovereign bonds are backed by taxation and fiscal power of the issuing
         government.
      C. sovereign bonds are secured by high-quality collateral, such as prop-
         erty and equipment.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Sovereign bonds are backed by a national government’s taxa-
     tion and fiscal power and thus usually represent the highest-credit-quality
     bonds in each geographic market.
     A is incorrect because sovereign bonds, unless specifically indexed to infla-
     tion, are also subject to inflation risk.
     C is incorrect because sovereign bonds are typically not secured by collat-
     eral; this is more commonly a feature of corporate bonds and asset-backed
     securities.

  5. Which of the following is the appropriate order of claims in liquidation, by
     type of bond, in order of highest to lowest?
      A. Junior, senior secured, senior unsecured
      B. Senior unsecured, senior secured, junior
      C. Senior secured, senior unsecured, junior
     Solution:
     C is correct. Senior secured debts would be the highest-priority claims to
     be satisfied. Senior unsecured debts would be the next to receive allocations
     of the liquidated asset value, and junior debts would be the lowest-priority
     claims to be satisfied.

                           6. Describe the purpose of a pari passu clause in a bond indenture.
                              Solution:
                              A pari passu (“equal footing”) clause ensures that a debt obligation is treated
                              the same as the borrower’s other senior debt instruments.




            2           FEATURES OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES

                                       describe the features of a fixed-income security

                        Fixed-income instruments are debt instruments, such as loans and bonds. Loans
                        are debt instruments formed and governed by a private agreement usually between
                        an individual or company and a financial intermediary, such as a bank. Bonds or
                        fixed-income securities are more standardized contractual agreements between larger
                        issuers and investors. A bond issuer borrows money most often to fund operations or
                        capital expenditures. Bond investors are lenders who provide funds to the issuer in
                        exchange for interest payments and future repayment of principal. While corporate
                        issuers tend to have, at most, one or two types of equity securities outstanding, they
                        often have many types of debt obligations outstanding, each with distinct features,
                        such as time to maturity, seniority, and currency.

                         WHICH LIABILITIES ARE FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS?

                           Earlier modules in corporate issuers and financial statement analysis discussed
                           the balance sheets of corporate issuers composed of assets and the liabilities
                           and equity that finance them. Liabilities are broadly defined by accounting
                           standards as present obligations to transfer economic resources as a result of
                           past events. This definition encompasses many types of obligations, including
                           amounts that an issuer owes to suppliers, customers, employees, governments,
                           retirees, lessors, and so on.
                               Not all liabilities are fixed-income instruments (or “debt”), but all fixed-in-
                           come instruments are liabilities. In these modules on fixed income, from the
                           perspective of a corporate issuer, we are focused only on loans and bonds:
                           instruments that can be settled in cash and for which the counterparty is an
                           investor or a bank. Other liabilities, particularly leases and pension obligations,
                           share some characteristics with fixed-income instruments but are outside the
                           scope of these modules.
                                                                      Accounts Payable    Lease Liability
                                                                       (obligations to    (obligations to

      Note that government issuers tend to be financed by bonds, not by loans,
  though some exceptions exist—for example, loans from supranational organi-
  zations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

   The committed periodic cash flows of a bond distinguish it from equity securities.
Exhibit 1 shows the cash flows of a fixed-rate bond issued by Bright Wheels Automotive
(BRWA) Corporation.

At issuance, investors purchased the BRWA bond in exchange for cash equal to the
bond principal or the amount borrowed, which is also referred to as the bond’s par
value. On each interest payment date, BRWA commits to pay bond investors an inter-
est or coupon payment equal to the coupon rate times the par value of the bond. For
periods shorter than a year, the annual coupon amount is divided into smaller equal
periodic payments. On the bond’s maturity date, BRWA pays the final fixed coupon
and the principal amount to investors.
    The key features of each bond issue are usually summarized in a prospectus. Exhibit
2 outlines the terms of BRWA Corporation’s bond issue.

                        Issuer
                        A bond issuer can be any legal entity and is liable for all interest and principal payments.
                        Government sector issuers include national (also termed sovereign) or local govern-
                        ments, supranational organizations (such as the World Bank), and quasi-government
                        entities (agencies owned or sponsored by governments, such as postal services or
                        national railways). Because sovereign bonds are backed by the taxation and fiscal
                        power of the issuing government, they usually represent the lowest-credit-risk bond
                        in each region. Private sector issuers include corporate issuers and special purpose
                        entities created to take ownership in such assets as loans or receivables, financed by
                        asset-backed securities (ABS) issued to investors, which will be discussed in detail
                        in later lessons.


                        Maturity
                        A bond’s maturity is the date of the final payment the issuer makes to investors, and
                        the tenor refers to the remaining time to maturity. Fixed-income securities with a
                        tenor one year or less at issuance are known as money market securities, examples
                        of which include government Treasury bills and commercial paper issued by corpo-
                        rations. Bonds with tenors longer than one year at issuance are called capital market
                        securities. Perpetual bonds are a less common bond type with no stated maturity.
                        Public sector entities were the first issuers of perpetual bonds, and current examples
                        include local governments and local authorities, as well as certain bonds issued by
                        banks to meet regulatory capital requirements. Perpetual bonds are still distinct from
                        equities, however, in that they have contractually defined cash flows, no voting rights,
                        and greater seniority in the capital structure.

AIRPORT AUTHORITY HONG KONG’S PERPETUAL BONDS

   Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) is a statutory body responsible for
   operating and developing Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world’s
   busiest cargo airports and a major passenger hub connecting to over 200
   global destinations. In late 2020, following a sharp decline in passenger volume
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, AAHK announced a two-part, USD1.5 billion
   perpetual bond issue to fund construction of a third runway and for general
   corporate purposes. Asian and European investors demonstrated confidence in
   the airport’s recovery of passenger volume, placing orders totaling more than
   10× the offer amount.



Principal (Par or Face Value)
The principal, par value, or face value is the amount an issuer agrees to repay to
investors at maturity. In the BRWA Corporation example, the principal amount
of USD300 million is repaid at maturity, which is five years from issuance. Certain
instruments may repay the principal in equal or variable increments over time. A
common example is a mortgage loan, for which borrowers make a monthly payment
composed of both principal repayment and interest. The principal is repaid over time
and not in a lump sum at maturity.


Coupon Rate and Frequency
A bond’s interest can be paid as
   ■   a fixed coupon paid on specified dates,
   ■   a variable coupon determined and paid on specified dates, or
   ■   part of a single payment with the principal at maturity.
    Fixed-coupon bond payments usually involve uniform payments at monthly, quar-
terly, semi-annual, or annual intervals. Corporate bonds tend to pay semiannually.
    Bonds with variable interest payments are called floating-rate notes (FRNs). An
FRN coupon is determined as a combination of a market reference rate (MRR) and an
issuer-specific spread referred to as the credit spread. The MRR is a standard borrowing
or lending rate for issuers with the highest creditworthiness or lowest default risk for
different currencies and maturities. MRRs were historically determined by a poll of
lenders (Libor) but transitioned to an average of observed market transaction rates.
    The credit spread is set at the time of FRN issuance, is usually constant over the
bond’s life, and is expressed in basis points (bps), or hundredths of a percentage point.
The higher an issuer’s credit quality, the lower the spread. In contrast, the MRR resets
periodically throughout the bond’s life based on market factors. As the MRR changes,
the FRN coupon rate and interest payment change accordingly.
    Bonds that do not pay periodic interest and instead pay interest as part of a single
payment with principal at maturity are termed zero-coupon bonds or pure discount
bonds. Zero-coupon bonds are typically issued at a discount to par; the difference
between the issuance price and par value represents a cumulative interest payment
at maturity.

                         Seniority
                         A debt issue’s seniority or priority of repayment among all issuer obligations is an
                         important determinant of risk. Senior debt has priority over other debt claims in the
                         case of bankruptcy or liquidation. Junior debt, or subordinated debt, claims have a
                         lower priority than senior debt and are paid only once senior claims are satisfied. The
                         BRWA Corporation bonds are senior debt and would be repaid before any BRWA
                         subordinated debt in the event of bankruptcy.


                         Contingency Provisions
                         A contingency provision is a clause in a legal agreement that allows for an action if
                         an event or circumstance occurs. The most common contingency provision for bonds
                         involves embedded options—specifically, call, put, and conversion to equity options.
                         These resemble option contracts but cannot be traded separately from the bond itself.
                         However, the value of these embedded options may be established by comparing the
                         value of a bond with a contingency provision with that of an otherwise similar stan-
                         dard bond from the same issuer. The BRWA bond does not contain any contingency
                         provisions, but this feature will be explored in depth in later lessons.
                             We can use the features of a bond issue to model its cash flows. Exhibit 3 illus-
                         trates the cash flows over the life of the five-year, fixed-coupon BRWA Corporation
                         bond described earlier.

                         payments as follows:
                             Annual interest expense = Bond par value × Coupon rate.

   Annual interest expense = USD300,000,000 × 3.2%.

   Annual interest expense = USD9,600,000.

   Semiannual interest expense = USD9,600,000/2 = USD4,800,000.
At the end of the fifth year on the maturity date, BRWA Corporation pays investors
the final semiannual coupon payment plus the par value of USD300 million for a total
of USD304.8 million.


Yield Measures
Given a bond’s expected cash flows and its price, return or yield measures can be
calculated. One simple measure is the current yield (CY), equal to the bond’s annual
coupon divided by the bond’s price and expressed as a percentage. For example, if the
five-year BRWA bond were trading at a price of USD101 per USD100 in face value at
time t, its current yield would be
   CYt = Annual coupont/Bond pricet = 3.2%/1.01 = 3.168%.
The current yield is analogous to the dividend yield for an equity security.
    A more complex but far more common yield measure is the yield-to-maturity
(YTM), which is the internal rate of return (IRR) calculated using the bond’s price
and its expected cash flows to maturity. YTM is usually quoted as an annual rate. An
investor’s rate of return on a bond will equal the bond’s YTM at the time of purchase
as long as the investor
   1. receives all promised interest and principal payments as scheduled (i.e., no
      default),
   2. holds the bond until maturity, and
   3. reinvests all periodic cash flows at the YTM.
     Notice that these are the same IRR assumptions discussed in earlier modules. If
any of these assumptions do not hold, the investor’s rate of return on the bond invest-
ment will differ from the YTM. If the five-year BRWA bond were trading at a price
of USD101 per USD100 in face value immediately after issuance, its YTM is the rate,
r, in the following equation (recall that the 3.2% coupon is paid semiannually, or 1.6
in each of 10 periods per USD100 in face value):
   101 = 1.6/(1 + r)1 + 1.6/(1 + r)2 + . . . + 101.6/(1 + r)10.

   r = 1.49% on a semiannual basis, or 1.49% × 2 = 2.98% annualized.
   The YTM calculation is covered in depth in later modules.


Yield Curves
Most fixed-income issuers have many debt instruments outstanding. A useful way
of evaluating the YTM on one issue is to graph all an issuer’s debt instruments with
identical features by their YTM and times to maturity. This graphical depiction results
in a yield curve. BRWA has six bond issues outstanding, shown in Exhibit 4. The 3.2%,
five-year bond is the third point from the left.

                         In this example, the BRWA bonds with longer maturities have higher YTMs, indicating
                         that investors are demanding higher expected returns to compensate for higher risk
                         associated with longer-maturity bonds of the same issuer. A way to measure the credit
                         risk (one type of investment risk of fixed-income securities) for a bond is to compare
                         an issuer’s yield curve to that of comparable sovereign bonds, which have little or no
                         credit risk. Exhibit 5 shows the yield curve for BRWA bonds versus the yield curve
                         for comparable sovereign bonds in the United States, which are US Treasuries.

QUESTION SET


  1. Match the fixed-income instrument type in the left column with its
     description in the right column.
                                          ​




    A. Money market securities                I. Public and private bonds with a time
                                              to maturity of greater than one year
    B. Capital market securities              II. Fixed-income instruments with
                                              maturities of less than one year, such as
                                              commercial paper
    C. Perpetual bonds                        III. Bonds that have no stated maturity
                                              date
                                          ​




     Solution:

      A. II is correct. Money market securities are fixed-income instruments
         with maturities of less than one year, such as commercial paper.
      B. I is correct. Capital market securities are public and private bonds
         with a time to maturity of greater than one year.
      C. III is correct. Perpetual bonds have no stated maturity date.

  2. Calculate the coupon payment on a 2.5% coupon bond with GBP100,000 par
     value and a semiannual payment frequency.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is GBP1,250.
     The annual coupon on a bond is calculated by multiplying the coupon rate
     and the par value. For this bond, the coupon rate of 2.5% and par value
     of GBP100,000 results in a GBP2,500 annual coupon. However, since the
     payment frequency is semiannual (twice a year), each coupon payment is
     GBP1,250.

  3. Determine the appropriate FRN coupon and interest payable in the fol-
     lowing example: A European corporation issues a EUR10 million FRN
     that pays quarterly interest equal to the three-month MRR plus 125 bps. If
     three-month MRR is –0.50%, what is the corporation’s FRN coupon interest
     payable on the FRN for the period?
     Solution:
     The answer is EUR18,750.
     An FRN coupon comprises MRR plus the issuer-specific spread.
      FRN coupon = MRR + Spread.

      FRN coupon = –0.50% + 1.25%.

      FRN coupon = 0.75%.

      Annual interest = Principal × FRN coupon.

      Annual interest = €10,000,000 × 0.75%.

      Annual interest = €75,000, or €18,750 on a quarterly basis.

                            4. Fill in the blanks. The current yield is equal to a bond’s annual _____ divided
                               by the bond’s price expressed as a percentage. If the bond’s price were to fall,
                               we would expect the current yield to ____.
                               Solution:
                               The current yield is equal to a bond’s annual coupon divided by the bond’s
                               price expressed as a percentage. If the bond’s price were to fall, we would
                               expect the current yield to rise.

                            5. Fill in the blanks. A downward-sloping yield curve indicates that
                               yields-to-maturity on an issuer’s longer-term bonds are __________ than
                               yields-to-maturity on that issuer’s shorter-term bonds.
                               Solution:
                               A downward-sloping yield curve indicates that yields-to-maturity on an
                               issuer’s longer-term bonds are lower than yields-to-maturity on that issuer’s
                               shorter-term bonds.

                                       and negative covenants



                         Bond Indentures
                         Fixed-income security features outlined in the prior lesson are included in a legal
                         contract that describes the form of the bond, the obligations of the issuer, and the
                         rights of the bondholders. This legal contract is referred to as the bond indenture.
                         In addition to specifying a bond’s features, an indenture identifies the issuer’s sources
                         of repayment, any commitments made by the issuer to bondholders, as well as any
                         provisions that support or enhance the issuer’s ability to repay its debt in full.


                         Sources of Repayment
                         The sources of bond repayment vary among issuers and are a key factor in determining
                         a bond’s relative risk. For example, national governments have the sovereign right
                         to tax economic activity (and, in some cases, print currency), which results in their
                         bonds often holding the highest credit quality in a given region. Sovereign bonds in
                         developed markets are often considered to have no default risk and are used as the
                         benchmark for relative bond market risk.
                             Local or regional governments may either use their taxing authority as the source
                         of bond repayment or consider fees from infrastructure projects, such as bridges,
                         toll roads or public transit systems, to repay interest and principal on an associated
                         bond issue.
                             Investors in corporate bonds usually rely on the operating cash flows of the firm
                         as their primary source for interest and principal payments. As shown in later lessons,
                         investors use such factors as profitability and leverage to gauge the expected variabil-
                         ity of corporate cash flows available to service debt. Corporate bonds for issuers of
                         higher credit quality are usually unsecured, which means these cash flows are the

Bond Indentures and Covenants                                                               15


sole source of repayment, as in the earlier BRWA Corporation example. Corporate
issuers with less stable operating cash flows usually face more credit provisions and
restrictions and may offer investors a legal claim (or lien or pledge) on specific assets
as a secondary source of debt repayment in what are referred to as secured bonds.
In liquidation, the secured debtholders may receive the value of the designated assets
while unsecured debtholders would only receive any funds remaining after this allo-
cation. A junior unsecured bondholder would be the last creditor in line to receive
the asset value of an issuer in default, because all secured debts and senior unsecured
debts would have higher-priority claims.
    Investors evaluate operating cash flows as well as these secondary claims (referred
to as collateral) when assessing an issuer’s credit quality, which may include physical
assets; cash flows, such as licensing fees; or financial guarantees from a third party.
Issuers must weigh the benefit of providing these credit enhancements (lower bor-
rowing costs) with the costs in terms of reduced operating flexibility.

As the name suggests, the source of repayment for asset-backed securities (ABS) are
the cash flows from a group of loans or receivables owned by the special purpose
issuer. A later module will show in detail how an ABS transaction recreates an entire
capital structure of asset-based cash flow claims across investor classes with different
priority claims to these cash flows. These different classes shown in Exhibit 7 are
referred to as tranches.

                         For example, Tranche A notes might have a priority claim to periodic cash flows fol-
                         lowed by Tranche B. Tranche C investors would receive cash flows only after Tranche
                         A and B investors.


                         Bond Covenants
                         Bondholders have limited influence over an issuer as compared to equity investors,
                         who have voting rights. One exception to this is legally enforceable rules or bond
                         covenants that borrowers and lenders agree on at the time a bond is issued or a
                         loan is made. Affirmative covenants specify what issuers are required to do, whereas
                         negative covenants specify what issuers are prohibited from doing.
                              Affirmative covenants are typically administrative in nature. For example, common
                         affirmative covenants include the use of proceeds from the bond issue, the provision
                         of timely financial reports, and permitting bondholders to redeem their bonds at a
                         premium to par if the issuer is acquired.
                              Other affirmative covenant examples include a pari passu clause (or “equal foot-
                         ing” clause), which ensures that a debt obligation is treated the same as the borrower’s
                         other debt obligations with similar seniority. A cross-default clause specifies that
                         borrowers are considered in default if they default on another debt obligation. These
                         covenants typically neither impose additional costs on an issuer nor materially con-
                         strain the issuer’s discretion in operating its business.
                              Exhibit 8 provides the covenants faced by BRWA Corporation for its senior unse-
                         cured bonds from the prior example.



                           Exhibit 8: BRWA Bond: Brief Summary of Indenture Terms

                                                 3.2% BRWA Corporation Five-Year Notes
                                                    Prospectus Summary (Continued)
                         Issuer:               Bright Wheels Automotive Corporation
                         Use of Proceeds:      We will use the net proceeds from the Notes for general corporate
                                               purposes
                         Seniority:            The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of BRWA
                                               Corporation and will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and
                                               unsubordinated indebtedness.
                         Limitation on         The Indenture restricts our ability to pledge some of our assets as
                         Liens:                security for other debt.
                         Limitation on Sales   The Indenture prohibits us from selling and leasing back any plant
                         and Leasebacks:       for a term of more than [X] years
                         Merger and            The Indenture prohibits us from merging or consolidating with
                         Consolidation:        any company or selling all or substantially all of our assets to any
                                               company if after doing so the surviving company would violate the
                                               limitation on liens or sales and leasebacks discussed above.

                         As a senior unsecured issuer, BRWA’s use of proceeds is broadly defined, and it faces
                         few negative covenants limiting its business decisions. The limitations of liens and sale
                         and leaseback, as well as merger and consolidation restrictions, all protect bondholders
                         from the dilution of their claims as senior bondholders.
                             Issuers of lower credit quality often face additional covenants established to pro-
                         tect bondholders if an issuer’s financial condition deteriorates. For example, consider
                         the case of Vivivyu Inc., a digital media corporation that has issued senior secured
                         callable bonds, as shown in Exhibit 9.

In the case of Vivivyu, bondholders are protected by a set of covenants which closely
monitor certain financial ratios and restrict its ability to pay dividends to shareholders,
repurchase shares, and / or take on additional debt unless tighter financial restrictions
are met under what is referred to as an incurrence test (see Exhibit 10).

Restriction on               Unless the Incurrence Test is met, the Issuer shall not issue
Additional Debt:             additional debt unless it is (a) subordinated or (b) a working
                             capital facility up to 20% of the Principal Amount of Notes

                         Other negative covenants include limitations on investments, the disposal of assets,
                         or issuance of debt senior to existing obligations under what is known as a negative
                         pledge clause. Negative covenants seek to ensure that an issuer maintains the abil-
                         ity to make interest and principal payments. Highly restrictive covenants may not
                         be in the bondholders’ best interest if they force an issuer to default when it may be
                         avoided. For example, strict debt restrictions may prevent an issuer from raising new
                         funds necessary to meet contractual obligations. Covenant violations can provide
                         bondholders recourse in several possible ways, including a change in financial terms,
                         such as an increase in a bond’s interest rate, accelerated debt payments, or termination
                         of the debt agreement.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Explain the difference in the sources of repayment for a secured and
                               an unsecured corporate bond.
                               Solution:
                               The sole source of repayment for unsecured corporate bonds is typically op-
                               erating cash flows of the issuer, while secured corporate bonds also include
                               specific assets as a secondary source of debt repayment in addition to the
                               issuer’s operating cash flows.

                            2. Describe the source of repayment for asset-backed securities.
                               Solution:
                               The source of repayment for asset-backed securities are cash flows from the
                               group of loans or receivables owned by the special purpose issuer.

                            3. Match the bond covenant type in the left column with the examples in the
                               right column.
                                                                    ​




                             A. Affirmative Covenant               I. Additional Debt Restriction
                             B. Negative Covenant                  II. Cross-Default Clause
                                                                   III. Interest Coverage Minimum
                                                                    ​




                               Solution:

                               A. II is correct. A cross-default clause specifies that borrowers are con-
                                  sidered in default if they default on another debt obligation and is an
                                  affirmative covenant.
                               B. I and III are correct. An additional debt restriction clause limits an
                                  increase in issuer debt and is a negative covenant. An interest coverage
                                  minimum limits the amount of leverage relative to an issuer’s operat-
                                  ing income or EBITDA.

                            4. Describe the difference between affirmative and negative bond covenants.
                               Solution:
                               Affirmative covenants specify what issuers are required to do, whereas nega-
                               tive covenants specify what issuers are prohibited from doing.

                            5. Fill in the blanks. Covenant violations provide bondholders recourse in
                               several possible ways, including a change in _________ terms, such as an

                         The following information relates to questions
                         1-5

                                floating-rate notes would be considered asset-backed securities.

                             B. The Antelas AG notes rely on the operating cash flows of the firm as their
                                sole source for interest and principal payments.

                             C. The Antelas AG notes rely on the operating cash flows of the firm as their
                                primary source for interest and principal payments.

                         3. Antelas AG’s issuer-specific credit spread rises by 25 bps p.a. one year after the
                            FRN issuance. Which of the following best describes how Antelas AG’s FRN cou-

Practice Problems                                                                      21


   pon would change as a result?
   A. Antelas AG’s FRN coupon payment to investors will immediately increase
      by 25 bps p.a.

   B. Antelas AG’s FRN coupon payment to investors will increase by 25 bps p.a.
      but will not become effective until the next full debt coupon period begins.

   C. Antelas AG’s FRN coupon will remain unchanged.

4. Calculate the value of Antelas’s payment to bondholders on the maturity date if
   the MRR is 0.25% p.a. for the final interest period.
   A. EUR1,718,750

   B. EUR251,718,750

   C. EUR256,875,000

5. Antelas decides to raise new secured, unsubordinated debt. Which of the follow-
   ing best describes the priority of payments between the issuer’s new debt and its
   existing debt?
   A. Because the Antelas AG notes have a pari passu (or “equal footing”) clause,
      this debt obligation will be treated the same as any other secured, unsubor-
      dinated debt from this borrower.

   B. Because the existing debt was issued earlier, it would receive priority over
      the new debt in terms of the payment of interest and principal.

   C. We do not have enough information to answer this question; the necessary
      information would be provided in the indenture for new secured, unsubor-
      dinated notes.

                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. A is correct. The notes mature (the date Antelas AG will pay the final coupon and
                            principal amount) four years after the trade settlement date, and the coupon rate
                            is variable, determined by the MRR plus a fixed 250 bp spread.

                         2. C is correct. Secured corporate bonds rely on the operating cash flows of the firm
                            as their primary source for interest and principal payments and a legal claim on
                            assets as a secondary source of payment.
                            A is incorrect because asset-backed securities (ABS) are issued by
                            special-purpose entities created to take ownership in loans or receivables, the
                            cash flows from which are used to pay interest and principal to investors.
                            B is incorrect because it describes unsecured, not secured, corporate debt.

                         3. C is correct. For the Antelas AG FRN, the spread is fixed at 250 bps and the cou-
                            pon will only change with changes in the MRR.

                         4. B is correct. On the maturity date, Antelas AG pays investors the final FRN cou-
                            pon payment plus the bond’s principal amount. The FRN coupon comprises MRR
                            plus the issuer-specific spread.
                             ■   FRN coupon rate: MRR plus spread, or 0.25% + 2.50%= 2.75%
                             ■   Annual interest expense: Principal × FRN coupon, or €EUR250,000,000 ×
                                 2.75% = EUR6,875,000
                             ■   Quarterly interest expense: Annual interest expense/4, or EUR6,875,000/4
                                 = EUR1,718,750
                             ■   Principal Amount: EUR250,000,000
                             ■   Total Payment = EUR250,000,000 + EUR1,718,750 = 251,718,750

                         5. A is correct. Antelas AG’s existing secured, unsubordinated debt has a pari passu
                            (or “equal footing”) clause, which ensures that this debt obligation will be treated
                            the same as any other secured, unsubordinated debt from this borrower.
                            B is incorrect because the priority of payments is unrelated to the timing of
                            issuance.
                            C is incorrect because the pari passu clause ensures equal footing for similar new
                            debt.

Fixed-Income Cash Flows and Types
 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              describe common cash flow structures of fixed-income instruments
              and contrast cash flow contingency provisions that benefit issuers

              describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the
              issuance and trading of fixed-income securities




INTRODUCTION
A fixed-income instrument’s cash flows are determined by its features. In this module,
                                                                                              1
we discuss common fixed-income instrument cash flow structures and their implica-
tions for issuers and investors. The module’s final lesson discusses the legal, regulatory,
and tax considerations across jurisdictions faced by fixed-income issuers and investors.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   In contrast to standard bullet bonds with full principal repay-
           ment at maturity, amortizing bonds have a payment schedule
           that involves early repayment of principal. Sinking funds and waterfall
           structures represent special cases of amortizing bonds.
       ■   Other coupon payment structures include index-linked bonds that
           offer payments adjusted for changes in price indices and bonds with
           step-up coupons, with coupons that increase by specific amounts in
           the future based on a schedule or subject to specific provisions.
       ■   Fixed-income contingency provisions include call, put, and conversion
           features. A call feature grants an issuer the right to buy bonds back
           early at a fixed price, while a put feature grants an investor the right to
           sell bonds to the issuer at a fixed price prior to maturity. Convertible
           bonds grant investors the right to convert the bond into shares of the
           issuer’s stock at a pre-determined price.

24   Learning Module 2                                                     Fixed-Income Cash Flows and Types


                                ■   Bonds can be classified as domestic, foreign, or Eurobonds. Domestic
                                    bonds are those issued in a country by an issuer incorporated in that
                                    same country, while foreign bonds are issued by entities incorporated
                                    elsewhere.
                                ■   Eurobonds are issued internationally in a currency different from that
                                    country’s domestic currency (e.g. US dollar bonds issued in London)
                                    and are subject to fewer listing, disclosure, and regulatory require-
                                    ments than domestic or foreign bonds.
                                ■   Bond interest earned by an investor is usually taxed as ordinary
                                    income, although some bonds offer tax advantages. Some countries
                                    also apply a capital gains tax. Specific tax provisions often apply for
                                    bonds issued at a discount or purchased at a premium.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                            These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                            of understanding of this learning module.

                            1. An investor that is more sensitive to an issuer’s credit risk than to reinvest-
                               ing risk would most likely invest in a:
                               A. bullet bond.
                               B. partially amortizing bond.
                                C. fully amortizing bond.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Investors receive higher near-term cash flows on amortizing
                               debt versus bullet bonds and face lower credit risk because the borrower’s
                               liability is reduced over time. However, investors also face the risk of rein-
                               vesting the higher near-term cash flows at prevailing market interest rates,
                               which can fluctuate. This effect is larger for fully amortizing bonds versus
                               partially amortizing bonds.

                            2. Match the term in the left column with its description in the right column.
                                                                      ​




                             A. Bullet bond                 I. A bond with a fixed periodic payment schedule
                                                            that reduces the bond’s outstanding principal to a
                                                            portion of the principal to be repaid on the matu-
                                                            rity date
                             B. Partially amortizing bond   II. A bond with a coupon rate that increases by
                                                            specified margins at one or more specified dates
                             C. Step-up coupon bond         III. A bond that pays its face value and final interest
                                                            payment at maturity
                                                                      ​




                               Solution:

                               A. III is correct. A bullet bond pays 100% of its face value plus a final
                                  interest payment at the bond’s maturity.
                               B. I is correct. A bond characterized by a fixed periodic payment sched-
                                  ule that reduces the bond’s outstanding principal to a portion of the
                                  principal to be repaid on the maturity date is known as a partially
                                  amortizing bond.

Introduction                                                                               25


      C. II is correct. A bond with a coupon rate that increases by specified
         margins at one or more specified dates is known as a step-up coupon
         bond.

  3. A call provision embedded in a fixed-income security:
      A. is a benefit to the issuer.
      B. gives the bondholder the right but not an obligation to sell the bond.
      C. grants the bondholder some degree of inflation protection.
     Solution:
     A is correct. A call provision gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part
     of the bond at a pre-determined price on specified dates. It is a benefit to the
     issuer because if market interest rates fall, the issuer can replace the call-
     able bond with one with a lower interest rate. It also gives the issuer added
     flexibility if it has excess cash or wishes to change its capital structure in the
     future.
     B is incorrect. This describes a putable bond, not a callable bond. If a call-
     able bond is called, the bondholder is obliged to sell it to the issuer accord-
     ing to the specified terms.
     C is incorrect. A call provision does not grant the bondholder inflation pro-
     tection. A call would be exercised by the issuer if interest rates fall.

  4. A put provision embedded in a fixed-income security:
      A. is a benefit to the bondholders.
      B. leads to a lower value compared to a bullet bond.
      C. increases the likelihood that its issuer will be acquired.
     Solution:
     A is correct. A put provision gives bondholders the right to sell the bonds
     back to the issuer at a pre-determined price on specified dates. The put pro-
     vision is a benefit to bondholders because it can protect them from the risk
     of the price of the bond falling from, for example, rising interest rates.
     B is incorrect. As put provisions are beneficial to investors, putable bonds
     are priced at a premium, not a discount, relative to option-free counterparts.
     C is incorrect. Put provisions can deter acquirers because the exercise of
     putable bonds results in an immediate claim on cash, making the acquisition
     more expensive. Issuing bonds with put provisions is a strategy employed by
     some firms to deter unfriendly takeovers known as a “poison puts.”

  5. Match the term in the left column with its description in the right column.
                                             ​




    A. Eurobond          I. A bond issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country
    B. Global bond       II. A bond issued simultaneously in the Eurobond market
                         and in at least one domestic bond market
                                             ​




     Solution:

      A. I is correct. Eurobonds are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single
         country, are usually unsecured, and may be denominated in any cur-
         rency, including the issuer’s domestic currency.

26   Learning Module 2                                                     Fixed-Income Cash Flows and Types


                               B. II is correct. A global bond is a bond issued simultaneously in the
                                  Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market, ensuring
                                  sufficient demand for large bond issues and access to all fixed-income
                                  investors regardless of location.

                            6. Compared to a bond with an original issue discount (OID) tax provision, an
                               otherwise identical bond without this provision would most likely have:
                               A. lower taxes due at maturity.
                               B. the same taxes due at maturity.
                                C. higher taxes due at maturity.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Under the OID tax provision, the investor will recognize
                               a prorated portion of the OID as taxable income each year and pay no
                               capital gains tax upon maturity. Investors without an OID tax provision
                               will recognize no taxable income until maturity, upon which they will face
                               capital gains tax on the OID (provided there is capital gains tax in their
                               jurisdiction).




             2           FIXED-INCOME CASH FLOW STRUCTURES

                                      describe common cash flow structures of fixed-income instruments
                                      and contrast cash flow contingency provisions that benefit issuers
                                      and investors

                         The most common bond cash flow structure is that of a standard fixed-coupon bond,
                         often referred to as a bullet bond. The bond issuer receives the principal at settle-
                         ment, makes periodic, fixed coupon payments, and repays the principal at maturity.
                         Most government and corporate issuers use bullet bonds as their primary means of
                         debt financing, and investors often prefer the associated fixed income stream and set
                         maturity to fund known cash flows. Exhibit 1 shows the bullet bond structure of the
                         five-year, USD300 million, 3.2% semiannual coupon BRWA bond introduced in the

Some instruments, including most loans, have cash flow structures that differ from
that of the bullet bond. For example, some instruments have principal repayments
distributed over the life of the instrument. In the case of interest payments, most loans
pay periodic interest at a rate that changes as short-term market rates change, while
others change based on credit or other provisions. Finally, zero-coupon bonds are sold
at a discount with no cash flow during their life until repayment of par at maturity.
These bonds pay no periodic interest, but the difference between the discount price
and par at maturity represents a cumulative interest payment at maturity.


Amortizing Debt
Fixed-income instruments that periodically retire a portion of principal outstanding
prior to maturity offer a borrower the ability to spread payments more evenly over the
life of the instrument. Examples include commercial or residential real estate mortgage
loans. Investors receive higher near-term cash flows on this amortizing debt relative
to bullet bonds and face lower credit risk because the borrower’s liability is reduced
over time. However, investors also face the risk of reinvesting the higher cash flows at
prevailing market interest rates over the life of the instrument, which could decline.
     Let us consider the opposite of the BRWA five-year bullet bond, a fully amortizing
loan for the same term and at the same interest rate. As shown in Exhibit 2, principal
amortization begins on the first interest payment date and continues through maturity.

                         Note that while the first interest payment, USD4.8, is identical to that of the bullet
                         bond, instead of interest-only coupons each period followed by the final coupon and
                         principal at maturity, investors receive a uniform USD32.7 periodic cash flow until
                         maturity, which in the first period includes USD27.9 of principal amortization. Over
                         time, the interest portion of the payment declines while the principal repayment
                         portion increases.
                             Let us assume instead that BRWA issues a bond with the same maturity and at
                         the same rate but repays a portion of the principal each period, with a final lump sum
                         payment (or balloon payment) at maturity equal to half of the principal amount.
                         The interest and principal payments for this partially amortizing bond are shown

The fully amortizing loan has a level semiannual payment equal to the sum of inter-
est and principal repayment. We may calculate the periodic payment (A) as follows:

                             The fully amortized BRWA bond is a five-year, 3.2% semiannual coupon bond with a
                         par value of USD300 million. The periodic payment is calculated as follows, in millions:
                                 r × Principal
                             	​A = _

                             A = USD32.70.
                         Therefore, the semiannual payment is a constant USD32.70, as shown in Exhibit 2,
                         but the principal and interest amounts vary each period as follows:
                             ■   First semiannual interest payment: USD300 × 3.2%/2 = USD4.80.
                             ■   Initial principal repayment: USD32.7 − USD4.8 = USD27.90.
                             ■   Outstanding principal after first period: USD300 − USD27.90 = USD272.10.
                             The USD272.10 outstanding principal becomes the basis for the calculation of the
                         interest and principal payment in the second period:
                             ■   Second semiannual interest payment: USD272.10 × 3.2%/2 = USD4.35.
                             ■   Second principal repayment: USD32.70 − USD4.35 = 28.35.
                             ■   Outstanding principal after second period: USD272.10 − USD28.35 =
                                 USD243.75.
                            Note that the periodic payment is constant, but over time, the interest payment
                         decreases while the principal repayment increases.
                            The partially amortized bond in Exhibit 3 with the USD150 balloon principal
                         payment paid at maturity combines two elements:
                             1. a five-year fully amortizing loan with USD150 notional and
                             2. a USD150 balloon payment at maturity.
                             The sum of the present values of these two elements is equal to the bond price
                         of USD300. The present value (PV) of the USD150 balloon payment is calculated as
                                                         USD150

Fixed-Income Cash Flow Structures                                                         31


The periodic payment is USD18.75, as shown in Exhibit 3. The final semiannual
payment of USD168.75 is the sum of the final constant USD18.75 payment and the
outstanding principal amount of USD150. Since the principal amount is not fully
amortized, interest payments are higher for the partially amortized bond in each
period than for the fully amortized bond, except the first period when they are equal.
    Commercial and residential mortgages are common examples of fully amortizing
loans. Mortgage borrowers usually prefer the constant cash flows of fully amortizing
loans, because they are better able to match rental or lease income in the case of
commercial borrowers or personal income for households. In the United States, these
mortgage loans often back bonds known as mortgage-backed securities with cash
flows similar to those of the loan shown in Example 1.

EXAMPLE 1

  30-Year Fixed-Rate Residential Mortgage Loan
  A borrower agrees to purchase a home and enters into a mortgage loan with a
  financial intermediary based on the following terms:

        Home price: USD500,000

        Loan amount: USD400,000

        Annual interest rate: 3.50%

        Loan term: 360 months
     Noting that the borrower’s monthly interest rate is 0.29167% (= 3.50%/12),
  we can use Equation 1 to calculate the homeowner’s monthly mortgage payment
  on the USD400,000 loan as follows:
            0.0029167​(USD400, 000)​
        	​A = __________________
                
              ​            ) −360
                                  ​ = USD1, 796.18.​
               1 − ​ 1.0029167 ​ ​
                   (

     As in the case of BRWA, we can calculate the interest and principal com-
  ponents of each periodic payment, with the first five and final five monthly
  payments of the 30-year mortgage shown below.

32   Learning Module 2                                                     Fixed-Income Cash Flows and Types


                             Two additional bond amortization arrangements commonly encountered are
                         sinking funds, used primarily by government and some corporate issuers, and
                         waterfall structures, which are commonly used in asset-backed securities (ABS) and
                         mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
                             A sinking fund arrangement is used by issuers to periodically retire a bond’s prin-
                         cipal outstanding. The term sinking fund refers to an issuer’s plans to set aside funds
                         over time in an escrow account to retire the bond early based on terms agreed upon
                         issuance. For example, an issuer may direct the bond trustee to redeem a predetermined
                         principal amount selected from among investors at random. Alternatively, the issuer
                         may have the right to repurchase bonds prior to maturity at a predetermined fixed
                         price under a contingency feature addressed later in this lesson. Like amortization,
                         sinking funds reduce credit risk while increasing reinvestment risk due to a reduction
                         of principal outstanding prior to maturity.
                             Another structure for principal repayment is a waterfall. This approach is used to
                         determine the timing of cash flows to investor classes with different priority claims to
                         the same cash flows. In the most common form, interest or coupon payments are paid
                         to all classes with no preference, but the repayment of principal occurs sequentially
                         so that the most senior investor class with the highest ranking in the capital structure
                         receives principal payments first, followed by the second-highest ranked investors
                         once the most senior class has been fully repaid. Exhibit 5 shows a typical waterfall
                         structure based on the three-tranche example from the prior module.

                                                                                               is fully repaid

                                                                                                      Principal received
                                                                                Tranche C            only when Tranches
                                                                              Bond Investor          A & B are fully repaid




                         Payment shortfalls are borne by the more junior tranches since the senior tranches
                         are paid first, so Tranche A faces the lowest credit risk, followed by Tranches B and C.


                         Variable Interest Debt
                         Some bonds and most loans have variable interest payments, calculated using a market
                         reference rate (MRR) and a credit spread. Financial intermediaries, such as banks,
                         prefer floating-rate loan assets since they match their variable-rate liabilities, such as
                         deposits. Loans or floating-rate notes (FRN) are also attractive to investors seeking
                         to benefit from rising interest rates.
                             Recall that a variable-rate loan or FRN coupon consists of a periodically resetting
                         MRR plus an issuer-specific credit spread.
                             FRN coupon = MRR + Credit spread.
                         For example, practice problems in the prior module highlighted the four-year, EUR250
                         million Antelas AG FRN issued at an interest rate of MRR + 250 bps p.a. paid quar-
                         terly. Exhibit 6 shows the final four Antelas AG FRN cash flows, including principal
                         repayment at maturity similar to a fixed-rate bullet bond.

For example, in Quarter 15, the coupon rate is 2.75% (= 0.25% + 2.50%) and the quar-
terly interest payment is calculated as follows:
   (2.75% × EUR250,000,000)/4 = EUR1,718,750.
    Investors face less interest rate risk with variable-rate instruments because cou-
pon payments adjust with interest rates, unlike fixed-coupon bonds. However, like
fixed-coupon bonds, variable-rate instruments still have credit risk: If an issuer’s
likelihood of missing payments increases, investors will seek a higher yield as compen-
sation for lower credit quality, causing their price to fall, irrespective of any changes
in the MRR.
    In addition to changing cash flows based on variations in MRR, other adjustment
mechanisms exist, which can be either predetermined or tied to an event. In the
case of predetermined adjustments, a bond coupon increases by specified margins at
specified dates. These bonds are referred to as step-up bonds and are used to protect
investors against rising rates and, in some cases, to provide an incentive for issuers
to take advantage of a contingency provision, as addressed later. An example of cash
flow changes based on an event are higher coupons in the event of a deterioration in
an issuer’s credit quality. This provides investors with greater comfort that they will
be compensated for adverse credit changes and allows less creditworthy issuers to
obtain debt financing for longer and/or at lower spreads than may be possible at a
fixed coupon. This is most common with leveraged loans, or loans to issuers of lower
credit quality. Coupon changes may also be linked to financial covenants or credit
ratings, which are sometimes used in what are referred to as credit-linked notes.
    For example, say that Antelas AG experiences a decline in its credit quality as the
FRN matures. It must therefore adequately address investor credit concerns by revising
the terms of its debt. Exhibit 7 shows how Antelas might achieve this by entering a
loan agreement arranged by a bank with a credit spread that adjusts based on leverage
and interest coverage ratios.

                         Antelas maintains its current credit spread only if its total leverage ratio remains
                         below 2.5×, with a higher spread if leverage increases. An issuer concerned about
                         potential cash flow problems in the future might seek to add a payment-in-kind (PIK)
                         feature to a loan or bond. PIK features allow an issuer to pay periodic interest in the
                         form of an increase in the bond or loan principal outstanding rather than as a cash
                         payment. This feature is most frequently used by firms with relatively high reliance
                         on debt financing and are usually associated with a higher interest rate to compensate
                         investors assuming greater principal risk.
                             As the following box example shows, the use of variable bond coupon provisions
                         is not limited to issuers with credit quality or cash flow issues.

                            announced plans to close most of its coal power capacity to sharply reduce
                            carbon emissions, increase renewable energy production, and modernize and
                            partially privatize its power grid. In order to attract a broader investor base to
                            provide debt financing for its ambitious plans, PPC issued sustainability-linked
                            bonds in early 2021 based on the following terms:

            Public Power Corporation Five-Year Sustainability-Linked Bonds
                                      Key Terms
    Interest Payment:       Commencing 9/30/21 to be paid semiannually with final
                            payment on the Maturity Date

   PPC’s sustainability-linked bonds were the first of its kind for a European
   high-yield issuer. The CO2-related step-up margin feature in PPC’s bonds was
   a significant factor in attracting widespread investor demand in a transaction
   that exceeded the original EUR500 million planned size.

    Index-linked bonds have interest and/or principal payments linked to a specified
index. Although a bond may be linked to any variable, in practice, inflation-linked
bonds (sometimes referred to as linkers) tied to a broad consumer price index are
by far the most common type of index-linked bonds. The fixed interest and principal
payments of a standard bond are nominal cash flows whose purchasing power declines
with inflation. The interest rate a bondholder receives net of inflation is the real inter-
est rate, which is approximately equal to the nominal interest rate minus the rate of
inflation. Investors often use inflation-linked bonds to protect against rising prices
by receiving inflation-adjusted cash flows. Most inflation-linked bonds are issued by
sovereign governments. Examples include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
(TIPS) in the United States, which address investor demand for inflation-indexed cash
flows. There is also growing demand for inflation-linked emerging market bonds due
to investor concerns over high inflation. The following example demonstrates how
TIPS cash flows are adjusted for inflation.

EXAMPLE 2

   TIPS Cash Flow
   An investor purchases TIPS with the following terms:
                                               ​




    Principal amount:        USD115,000,000
    Semiannual coupon:       1.00% p.a.
    Time to maturity:        9.5 years
    Inflation protection:    Based on the change in the Consumer Price Index for All
                             Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average, Not
                             Seasonally Adjusted (CPI)
                                               ​




      If the CPI rises from 265.00 to 267.25 over the next semiannual interest
   period, the next coupon payment is calculated as follows:
       ■   Inflation adjustment: (267.25 − 265) / 265 = 0.849%.
       ■   Inflation-adjusted principal = Principal amount × (1 + Inflation
           adjustment)
           = USD115,976,350 = USD115,000,000 × 1.00849.
       ■   Annual interest expense = Coupon rate × Inflation-adjusted principal,
           or
           = 1.00% × USD115,976,350 = USD1,159,764.
       ■   Semiannual interest paid = USD1,159,764/2 = USD579,882.

                             TIPS, which have a periodic principal adjustment based on a price index, are an
                         example of a capital-indexed bond. This approach protects the real value of debt
                         principal. Capital-indexed bonds are also issued by other sovereign governments,
                         including those of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Note that while defla-
                         tion causes the principal to decline over time, investors usually receive the greater of
                         the inflation-adjusted principal or par at maturity.
                             Unlike capital-indexed bonds, interest-indexed bonds pay a fixed nominal
                         principal amount at maturity. Only the coupon is index linked and pays an inflation
                         adjustment. These bonds are essentially an FRN in which the MRR is the rate of
                         inflation. Interest-indexed bonds are more commonly issued by private financial
                         intermediaries than by governments.


                         Zero-Coupon Structures
                         Zero-coupon bonds repay principal at maturity but have no coupon payments.
                         Zero-coupon bonds are often referred to as discount bonds, since they are priced
                         below par if interest rates are positive. An investor’s sole source of return is the differ-
                         ence between the price paid and the principal, which represents a cumulative interest
                         payment at maturity. Zero-coupon bonds are commonly issued by governments with
                         tenors less than 12 months. As sovereign interest rates fell to (or below) zero in the
                         wake of global financial crisis in 2008, zero-coupon bonds also became more common
                         at longer maturities. Zero-coupon bonds are also created by financial intermediaries
                         that sell individual interest or principal payments separated (or stripped) from sov-
                         ereign bullet bonds.
                              Zero-coupon bonds are useful for funding fixed future obligations. If interest
                         rates fall, a standard fixed-rate bond may fall short of meeting the obligation because
                         falling interest rates reduce reinvestment income (in other words, the investor’s rate
                         of return will fall below the original YTM because the reinvestment assumption at
                         the YTM does not hold). Since zero-coupon bonds require no coupon reinvestment,
                         investors in these bonds do not face this risk.


                         Deferred Coupon Structures
                         Deferred coupon bonds pay no interest for the first few years and have a higher
                         coupon paid later through maturity. Issuers of deferred coupon bonds usually seek to
                         conserve cash immediately following the bond issue, which may indicate lower credit
                         quality or that the issuer is financing a construction project that does not generate
                         income until completion. Similar to zero-coupon bonds, which may be considered an
                         extreme form of deferred coupon bond, deferred coupon bonds are typically priced at
                         a discount to par since the higher coupon is not usually sufficient to offset the forgone
                         interest in earlier periods.

QUESTION SET


  1. Compared to a bullet bond, an otherwise identical amortizing bond
     would most likely have:
      A. lower credit risk.
      B. lower reinvestment risk.
      C. lower near-term cash flows.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Compared to a bullet bond, an otherwise identical amortizing
     bond would have early principal repayments each period instead of all prin-
     cipal paid at maturity, lowering exposure to the issuers credit risk. However,
     larger periodic payments increase reinvestment risk.

  2. Calculate the periodic payment and the interest and principal components
     of the first payment for a fully amortizing bond based on the following:

      ■   Loan amount: USD10,000,000
      ■   Annual interest rate: 2.75%
      ■   Loan term: 10 semiannual periods (5 years)
     Solution:

                               coupon payment of a capital-indexed inflation-linked bond.
                               Solution:
                               The principal of capital-indexed inflation-linked bonds is adjusted using a
                               price index, with coupon payments calculated using a fixed coupon rate and
                               the adjusted principal. A decrease in the consumer price index (or deflation)
                               will cause the principal of a capital-indexed inflation-linked bond to be ad-
                               justed downward in the next period and result in a lower coupon payment.

                                                                               ​




                               Solution:

                               A. II is correct. A payment-in-kind feature allows an issuer to pay a bond
                                  or loan interest coupon by increasing principal.
                               B. I is correct. A floating-rate note coupon is based on a market reference
                                  rate plus a spread.
                               C. III is correct. A step-up coupon feature involves a coupon that
                                  increases by specified margins at specified dates.

A contingency provision is a clause in a legal agreement that allows for an action if an
event or circumstance occurs. The most common contingency provisions for bonds
involve the right—but not the obligation—for an issuer or the bondholders to take
an action specified in an indenture. These bond contingency provisions are often
referred to as embedded options because they resemble option contracts but cannot
be traded separately from the bond itself. The value of these embedded options may be
established by comparing the value of a bond with a contingency provision with that
of a bond from the same issuer without the provision. The most common bonds with
contingency provisions include callable bonds, putable bonds, and convertible bonds.


Callable Bonds
An issuer of a callable bond has the right to redeem (or “call”) all or part of the bond
prior to the specified maturity date. An issuer considering callable versus non-callable
bonds usually seeks the flexibility to refinance debt if market interest rates were to
fall. Fixed-price calls grant an issuer the right to buy back the bond at a predeter-
mined price in the future, as shown in Exhibit 9 for the Vivivyu Inc. bonds that were
introduced in the prior module.

                         Callable bonds typically specify a period over which the call feature cannot be used,
                         known as a call protection period. During the call period, the period in which the
                         call feature may be used, a schedule specifies the call price, or fixed price payable to
                         bondholders if the issuer calls the bond.
                             For example, the VIVU bond may not be called for the first three years but during
                         the following year may be called at a price of USD103.25 per USD100 in par value.
                         VIVU has the right to call the bond during the final four years at a fixed price that
                         declines over time. Investors face reinvestment risk starting in year three when the bond
                         can be called, as well as limited bond price appreciation beyond the fixed call price.
                             The value of the call feature depends on the relationship between the YTM and the
                         coupon of the bond. If the YTM rises above the coupon rate, there is little incentive for
                         the issuer to use the call feature. The YTM provides an estimate of refinancing costs,
                         which in this case exceeds the existing coupon. Therefore, the callable bond behaves
                         much like a non-callable equivalent bond with respect to price movements due to
                         interest rate changes. However, as a callable bond’s YTM falls below its coupon rate,
                         its price is effectively capped at the fixed call price, while the price of a non-callable
                         bond will continue to rise. Investors expect to be compensated on callable bonds with
                         a higher yield versus a similar non-callable bond given the uncertain maturity and
                         limited price appreciation, known as call risk.
                             Some bonds have a call feature, different from the fixed-price call, under which
                         the issuer compensates investors to buy bonds back known as a make-whole call.
                         Make-whole calls are most common among highly rated bond issues and offer issuers
                         greater flexibility to repurchase debt than purchases in the market. However, this pro-
                         vision usually requires an issuer to pay bondholders a high price based on the YTM
                         of a sovereign bond of similar maturity. Because this is usually well above the bond’s
                         current market price, make-whole calls are rarely executed and have little economic
                         impact on issuers or investors.


                         Putable Bonds
                         A put provision gives bondholders the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a
                         pre-determined price on specified dates. The put price is usually the par value of the
                         bond. Putable bonds benefit bondholders by guaranteeing a pre-specified selling
                         price at the redemption dates. If interest rates rise after issuance and bond prices fall,
                         bondholders can sell or “put” the bond back to the issuer and reinvest the proceeds
                         at higher market interest rates. The issuer will then be forced to refinance its debt
                         earlier than planned at higher yields.
                             Since a put provision has value to bondholders, the price of a putable bond will
                         be above the price of an otherwise similar non-putable bond. The yield on a bond
                         with a put provision must therefore be lower than the yield on an otherwise similar
                         non-putable bond. The lower yield compensates the issuer for the value of the put
                         option to the investor.
                             If a putable bond’s YTM is less than its coupon rate (so the price is higher than
                         the put price), the put feature is less valuable, and the putable bond behaves like an
                         option-free equivalent bond with respect to interest rate changes. However, if the
                         putable bond’s YTM increases above its coupon rate, the put price serves as a price
                         floor for the bond.


                         Convertible Bonds
                         A convertible bond is a debt instrument with a contingency provision related to the
                         issuer’s outstanding common equity. It grants bondholders the right to exchange the
                         issuer’s bond for a number of its common shares in the future at an effective price
                         per share known as the conversion price. The conversion feature rises in value to

Fixed-Income Contingency Provisions                                                                41


investors as the share price appreciates. Rather than a right to retire debt early in the
case of callable and putable bonds, if exercised, the convertible feature replaces debt
with equity.
    Exhibit 10 shows a convertible bond for ZTG BioTech S.p.a., a publicly traded
Italian company.

Issuer:                      ZTG Biotech S.p.a.
Settlement Date:             [T + 3 Business Days]
Maturity Date:               Five Years from Settlement Date unless the Notes are redeemed
                             earlier in a Conversion
Principal Amount:            EUR300 million
Interest:                    1.25% fixed coupon to be paid annually starting One Year from
                             the Settlement Date with the final coupon paid at Maturity

Conversion Provision:        An Investor has, at its sole option, the right to convert a portion
                             or the full sum of the Principal Amount, or any part outstand-
                             ing at any time at the Conversion Price during the Conversion

Current Share Price:         EUR28.00 per ZTGB common equity share
Conversion Price:            EUR42.00 per ZTGB common equity share
Conversion Period:           Any Business Day starting One Year from the Settlement Date
                             through the Maturity Date

The 1.25% annual coupon on the ZTGB convertible bond is well below the YTM inves-
tors would expect for a standard ZTGB bond of the same maturity. Bondholders are
often willing to accept a yield-to-maturity that is very low (or even zero) in exchange
for conversion rights. ZTGB bond investors have the right to exchange debt for ZTGB
common stock at a price of EUR42.00 per share, which represents a 50% premium
over the current ZTGB price of EUR28.00 per share [= (42.00 − 28.00)/28.00]. The
conversion ratio represents the number of common shares a bond may be converted
into for a specific par value:
   Conversion ratio = Convertible bond par value/Conversion price.                        (2)
For example, if the ZTGB bond is traded in EUR1,000 face value units,
    ■     the conversion ratio is equal to EUR1,000/EUR42, or 23.81, and
    ■     an owner of one EUR1,000 unit of the ZTGB bond has the right to redeem
          the bond for 23.81 shares of ZTGB stock during the conversion period.
    One way to estimate the value of the conversion feature at any time is to compare
the convertible bond’s price with its value if the bondholder were to convert the bonds
today. This conversion value is calculated as follows:
   Conversion value = Conversion ratio × Current share price.                             (3)
For example, assume that one year from ZTGB’s issuance date, the issuer’s shares are
trading at EUR35.00. A ZTGB bondholder could therefore convert one EUR1,000 unit
to a conversion value of EUR833.35 (= 23.81 × EUR35.00). If the convertible bond is
trading at par (or a market price of EUR1,000 per unit), the investor will prefer to hold

                         the bond and receive interest and principal rather than convert the bond to shares. In
                         general, a convertible bond’s price will vary with that of the issuer’s shares. If the share
                         price is well below the conversion price, the convertible bond’s price will approach
                         that of a standard non-convertible bond. If the issuer’s share price far exceeds the
                         conversion price, the bond’s price will more closely track its conversion value.
                             The use of convertible debt is common among growth companies, which may have
                         limited cash flow to pay interest and repay principal but are willing to raise equity at a
                         higher conversion price in the future. Convertible bonds also often include additional
                         features, such as a call provision, allowing issuers to limit bond investor gains from
                         share price appreciation by redeeming bonds early.
                             Some issuers may issue warrants with bonds. A warrant is an “attached,” rather
                         than embedded, option entitling the bondholder to buy the issuer’s stock at a fixed
                         exercise price until the expiration date. Warrants are used as a yield enhancement to
                         bond investors and are traded separately in financial markets, such as the Deutsche
                         Börse and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
                             Several European banks have issued a type of convertible bond called contingent
                         convertible bonds (CoCos), with contingent write-down provisions. While standard
                         convertibles will be converted when the share price increases, CoCos are converted
                         on the downside. This conversion is also not at the discretion of the investor but
                         happens automatically if a specified event occurs—for example, if the bank’s core Tier
                         1 capital ratio (a measure of the bank’s proportion of core equity capital available to
                         absorb losses) falls below a minimum regulatory requirement. If the bank experiences
                         losses that reduce its equity capital below the minimum regulatory capital require-
                         ment, CoCos convert debt into equity to increase its capital and reduce the bank’s
                         likelihood of default. CoCos were introduced in order to limit systemic risk, or the
                         risk of financial system failure. For this reason, CoCos offer investors a higher yield
                         than otherwise similar bonds. Note that the conversion is triggered by a specific event,
                         the breach of certain minimum regulatory capital requirements, and not by certain
                         equity or debt price levels.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. All else equal, the bond with the greatest benefit to the issuer is a
                               bond with:
                                A. no contingency provisions.
                                B. a fixed-price call provision.
                                C. a make-whole call provision.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Fixed-price calls grant the issuer the right to buy back the bond
                               at a predetermined price in the future, which is a benefit to the issuer if
                               interest rates fall.
                               A is incorrect. A bond with no contingency provisions is an option-free
                               bond and is not as beneficial to the issuer as a bond with a fixed-price call
                               provision.
                               C is incorrect. A make-whole call is a contingency feature under which
                               issuers can buy bonds back at a price usually based on the yield-to-maturity
                               of a sovereign bond of similar maturity plus a predetermined spread. Make-
                               whole calls are rarely executed and have little economic impact on issuers or
                               investors.

  2. Callable and putable bond prices with the same coupon rate will behave
     most like an option-free equivalent bond when their YTMs are, respectively:
      A. above the coupon rate and below the coupon rate.
      B. below the coupon rate and above the coupon rate.
      C. both near the coupon rate.
     Solution:
     A is correct. If a callable bond’s YTM rises above its coupon rate, the call
     feature is less valuable and a callable bond behaves much like a non-call-
     able bond with respect to price movements due to interest rate changes.
     If a putable bond’s YTM is less than its coupon rate, the put feature is less
     valuable and the putable bond’s price behaves like an option-free equivalent
     bond with respect to interest rate changes.
     B is incorrect. This is the reverse of the correct relationship.
     C is incorrect. If their YTMs are both near the coupon rate, both bonds will
     be near their price limits where the call and put features would be exercised.
     Their price changes would be lower in magnitude relative to a non-callable
     bond.

  3. A convertible bond will closely track its conversion value if the issuer’s share
     price is:
      A. below the conversion price.
      B. equal to the conversion price.
      C. above the conversion price.
     Solution:
     C is correct. In general, a convertible bond’s price will vary with that of the
     issuer’s shares. If the issuer’s share price far exceeds the conversion price,
     the bond’s price will more closely track its conversion value.
     A is incorrect. If the share price is well below the conversion price, the con-
     vertible bond’s price will approach that of a non-convertible bond.
     B is incorrect. In this case, the convertible bond would have a mix of price
     properties between that of a non-convertible bond and a convertible bond.

  4. Match each description in the right column with the correct bond in the left
     column.
                                           ​




    A. Convertible bond                    I. Conversion occurs automatically
    B. Contingent convertible (CoCo)       II. Conversion occurs at the discretion of
    bond                                   the investor
                                           III. More likely to convert if share price
                                           increases
                                           IV. More likely to convert if share price
                                           decreases
                                           ​




     Solution:

      A. II and III are correct. A standard convertible bond grants the right to
         redeem a bond for an issuer’s equity, occurs at the discretion of the
         investor, and is more likely if the issuer’s share price increases.

                               B. I and IV are correct. Contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds are con-

                                  occurs, such as a decline in bank capital below a regulatory minimum
                                  level.

                            5. An issuer that would like to conserve near-term cash outflows would most
                               likely issue a:
                               A. putable bond.
                               B. callable bond.
                                C. convertible bond.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. All else equal, an issuer would have the lowest interest pay-
                               ments on a convertible bond. Bondholders are often willing to accept a
                               yield-to-maturity that is very low (or even zero) in exchange for conversion
                               rights. Putable bonds offer lower yields than callable bonds because the put
                               option is a benefit to the bondholder while the call option is a benefit to the
                               issuer. However, the yields on callable and putable bonds are high compared
                               to yields on convertibles.




             4           LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND TAX CONSIDERATIONS

                                       describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the
                                       issuance and trading of fixed-income securities

                         Fixed-income securities are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements
                         depending on where they are issued and traded, as well as who holds them. Based on
                         the jurisdictions of the issuer and the issuance, a bond can be classified as a domestic,
                         foreign, or Eurobond. This classification has legal, tax, and regulatory implications
                         for issuers and investors.


                         Legal and Regulatory Considerations
                         Bonds issued by entities incorporated in the same country are called domestic bonds,
                         whereas bonds issued by entities incorporated in another country are called foreign
                         bonds. Domestic bond markets vary widely across emerging and developed markets,
                         and private and public issuers borrow outside the domestic market for various rea-
                         sons. Corporate issuers often match the currency of their bond financing cash flows
                         with that of their foreign operations using foreign bonds. Emerging market sovereign
                         governments typically issue bonds in major foreign currencies to attract a broader set
                         of investors and to diversify their investor base beyond the domestic bond market. In
                         order to establish itself as a center for Islamic finance and attract shari’a-compliant
                         investors, the UK government issued a sukuk, as described below.

                          UK SOVEREIGN SUKUK ISSUANCE

                            Sukuk are fixed-income instruments developed in accordance with Islamic law or
                            shari’a, which prohibits the payment of interest and financing of non-shari’a-com-
                            pliant sectors, such as alcohol or gambling. Instead of periodic interest, sukuk

  pay investors a periodic rental cash flow (or profit rate) from underlying assets,
  against which the investment company issuing the securities has an ownership
  claim for the life of the security.
      Sukuk issuers were historically concentrated in predominately Muslim coun-
  tries, including supranational entities, such as the Islamic Development Bank;
  sovereign issuers, including the Republic of Turkey; and corporate issuers, such
  as Saudi Aramco. In 2014, the United Kingdom became the first sovereign sukuk
  issuer outside the Muslim world with a GBP200 million, five-year sukuk issu-
  ance listed on the London Stock Exchange. These British pound–denominated
  sukuk were issued at a profit rate equivalent to the yield-to-maturity on a UK
  government benchmark security with a similar maturity, and the sukuk were
  backed by assets directly owned by the UK central government.

    In smaller emerging markets with less financial intermediation (frontier markets),
domestic bond issuance in frontier markets usually comprises domestic sovereign bonds
and bonds of local financial intermediaries, such as banks. Corporate debt financing
usually takes the form of a bank loan in these markets, and investors are limited to
indirect fixed-income exposure to corporate issuers via bank bond purchases. Frontier
market sovereign governments access local bond markets and use international bond
markets to fund external debt in foreign currencies. For example, Romania’s domestic
bond market, denominated in the Romanian leu (RON), is limited in scope, while
the Romanian government often issues debt in international bond markets. More
established domestic bond markets in emerging markets may include state-owned or
state-controlled enterprises and producers operating in a dominant domestic industry,
such as basic commodities. Since many emerging market bonds are denominated in a
restricted domestic currency with varying degrees of liquidity, the sovereign govern-
ment and a select few domestic issuers may issue bonds in a major foreign currency,
such as US dollars or euros. Developed market bond markets in major currencies,
in contrast, reflect a high degree of both financial intermediation and specialization,
attracting issuers from other jurisdictions and investors seeking returns in liquid
markets denominated in freely floating currencies. Multinational corporate issuers
may access several domestic bond markets to meet their funding needs. Recall the
earlier example of BRWA Corporation’s five-year US dollar fixed-rate bonds. Since
BRWA is a US-based corporation issuing bonds denominated in US dollars in the
United States, these bonds are considered domestic. If BRWA or a foreign subsidiary
were to issue euro-denominated bonds in Germany or yuan-denominated bonds in
China, these bonds would be considered foreign.
    The Eurobond market was created in the 1960s primarily to bypass the legal,
regulatory, and tax constraints imposed on bond issuers and investors, particularly
in the United States. Bonds issued and traded in this cross-border market are called
Eurobonds, and they are usually named for the currency in which they are denom-
inated, such as Eurodollar and Euroyen bonds, or euro-denominated Eurobonds for
the euro.
    Eurobonds are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country, are usually
unsecured, and may be denominated in any currency, including the issuer’s domestic
currency. They are usually underwritten by a group of financial intermediaries from
different jurisdictions and mostly sold to investors in Europe, the Middle East, and
Asia. Eurobonds denominated in US dollars cannot be sold to US investors at the
time of issue because they are not registered with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), with an exception for large qualified institutional investors. In
the past, Eurobonds typically were bearer bonds, meaning that the trustee did not
keep records of who owned the bonds; only the clearing system knew who the bond
owners were. Eurobonds, domestic bonds, and foreign bonds are now registered
bonds for which ownership is recorded by either name or serial number.

                             A global bond is a bond issued simultaneously in the Eurobond market and in
                         at least one domestic bond market, ensuring sufficient demand and access to all
                         fixed-income investors regardless of location. For example, the World Bank is a regular
                         issuer of global bonds. Many market participants refer to foreign bonds, Eurobonds,
                         and global bonds as international bonds, as opposed to domestic bonds.
                             For example, Exhibit 11 shows the terms of Romania’s first ever 30-year
                         euro-denominated bond issued in 2019.

                         Note that the Romanian sovereign bonds were available to both Eurobond investors
                         and investors in the United States under a private placement provision (Rule 144A)
                         that limits bond sales to certain qualified investors. The bond was priced at a 4.11%
                         spread over a German sovereign benchmark.
                             Cross-border issuance of public debt is not limited to sovereign governments. Many
                         federal agencies, as well as state and local governments, seek fixed-income investors
                         in foreign currencies and/or jurisdictions. For example, PT Indonesia Infrastructure
                         Finance (IIF) is a quasi-government entity established by the Republic of Indonesia
                         along with the World Bank and other multilateral institutions to provide infrastructure
                         financing and advisory in Indonesia. IIF issued US dollar–denominated Eurobonds

Domestic bonds, foreign bonds, Eurobonds, and global bonds are subject to different
legal, regulatory, and tax requirements in different jurisdictions. They also have differ-
ent interest payment frequencies and calculation methods affecting bond cash flows
and prices. Note, however, that the currency in which a bond is denominated has a
stronger effect on its price than where the bond is issued or traded. This is because
market interest rates have a strong influence on a bond’s price, and the market interest
rates that affect a bond are those associated with the currency in which the bond is
denominated. For example, while IIF was able to issue five-year US dollar debt with a
1.50% coupon, its domestic Indonesian rupiah–denominated bonds of a similar tenor
had a 6.97% yield-to-maturity.


Tax Considerations
The tax treatment of fixed-income securities is an important consideration for both
issuers and investors. For corporate issuers weighing the relative cost of debt and equity
capital, the tax deductibility of interest expense is an important factor in financing
decisions, as discussed in an earlier module on corporate issuers. For investors, bond
interest income is usually taxed at the ordinary income tax rate, which is typically the
same tax rate that an individual would pay on wage or salary income.
    Tax treatment for investors who purchase specific types of government bonds
may also vary by jurisdiction. For example, UK citizens pay income tax on accrued
and paid interest income but are exempt from capital gains tax arising when a bond is
sold above its original purchase price. In the United States, investors in US Treasuries
pay federal income tax on interest income but are exempt from state and local tax,
while investors in US state and local government bonds (known as municipal bonds)
are often exempt from federal income tax and from the income tax of the state in
which the bonds are issued, thereby encouraging investors to purchase state and local
bonds where they reside. The tax status of bond income may also depend on where
the bond is issued and traded. For example, some domestic bonds pay their interest
net of income tax. Other bonds, including some Eurobonds, make gross interest
payments (i.e., no withholding), which may give some investors greater flexibility as
to how and where they pay taxes on this interest income.
    In addition to earnings from interest, a bond investment will generate a capital gain
or loss if sold prior to maturity at a price different from the purchase price. Capital
gains or losses usually face different tax treatment from taxable income, which often
varies for long-term and short-term capital gains. For example, capital gains recog-
nized over a year after the original bond purchase may be taxed at a lower long-term
capital gains tax rate, whereas capital gains recognized within a year of bond purchase
may be taxed as a short-term capital gain that equals the ordinary income tax rate.
Exceptions exist, and not all countries have a separate capital gains tax or a distinction
by holding period.
    For bonds such as zero-coupon bonds issued at a discount, the tax status of the
original issue discount (OID) is an additional tax consideration that varies by coun-
try. The OID is the difference between the par value and the original issue price. For

                         example, the United States includes a prorated portion of the discount in interest
                         income every tax year, while Japan does not. The following example illustrates the
                         difference in tax treatment using a zero-coupon bond.

                          EXAMPLE 3

                            Zero-Coupon Bond Tax Treatment
                            Assume both a US-based investor and an investor based in a tax jurisdiction
                            without an original discount tax provision purchase an identical zero-coupon
                            US Treasury security based on the following terms:
                                ■   Principal amount: USD25,000,000
                                ■   Time to maturity: 5 years
                                ■   Issuance price: USD92.83 (per USD100 par value)
                               The original issue discount may be calculated as follows:

                                Original issue discount = Bond par value − Issuance price.

                                USD1,792,500 = USD25,000,000 − (0.9283 × USD25,000,000).
                                The USD1,792,500 original issue discount represents the interest that will
                            accrue to both investors over five years. Under the original issue discount tax
                            provision in the United States, the US-based investor will recognize a prorated
                            portion of the USD1,792,500 OID as taxable income each year and pay no capital
                            gains tax upon maturity. The non-US investor without an OID tax provision
                            will recognize no taxable income until maturity, upon which it will face capital
                            gains tax on the OID (provided there is capital gains tax in their jurisdiction).

                            Similarly, some jurisdictions also have tax provisions for bonds purchased at a
                         premium. They may allow investors to deduct a prorated portion of the amount paid in
                         excess of the bond’s par value from their taxable income every tax year until maturity.
                         This deduction may be a choice rather than a requirement, with an investor able to
                         decide whether to deduct a prorated portion of the premium each year or to deduct
                         nothing and declare a capital loss when the bond is redeemed at maturity.

      A. III is correct. Bonds sold in a country and denominated in that coun-
         try’s currency by an entity from another country are known as foreign
         bonds.
      B. I is correct. Bonds issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country
         are known as Eurobonds.
      C. II is correct. Bonds issued by entities that are incorporated in that
         country are known as domestic bonds.

  3. Fill in the blanks. An unregulated bond issued in domestic currency outside
     the issuer’s national borders is known as a _______________. A bond issued
     simultaneously in the Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond
     market is known as a ____________ bond.
     Solution:
     An unregulated bond issued in domestic currency outside the issuer’s na-
     tional borders is known as a Eurobond. A bond issued simultaneously in the
     Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market is known as a
     global bond.

    A. Original issue discount (OID) tax          I. Pay tax on interest income each year
    provision
    B. No original issue discount tax             II. Do not pay tax on interest income
    provision                                     each year
                                                  III. Pay capital gains tax at maturity
                                                  IV. Do not pay capital gains tax at
                                                  maturity
                                              ​




     Solution:

      A. I and IV are correct. Investors who face an original issue discount tax
         provision and purchase bonds issued at a discount must recognize a
         prorated portion of the OID in taxable income each year and pay no
         capital gains tax upon maturity.
      B. II and III are correct. Investors in bonds issued at a discount who do
         not face an OID tax provision will recognize no interest income until
         maturity, when they face capital gains tax on the OID.

                               B. domestic.

                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Bonds sold in a country (United Kingdom) and denominated in
                               that country’s currency (British pounds) by an entity from another country
                               (South Africa) are referred to as foreign bonds.

                            6. A domestic corporate issuer seeking to finance operations in a foreign mar-
                               ket would most likely issue:
                               A. foreign bonds.
                               B. domestic bonds.
                                C. Treasury bonds.
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Corporate issuers often match the currency of their bond fi-
                               nancing cash flows with that of their foreign operations using foreign bonds.
                               B is incorrect. The use of domestic bonds would not match the currency
                               of the issuer’s foreign operations. A second possibility would be to issue a
                               domestic bond and then use a swap to obtain the desired foreign currency
                               exposure. However, this method is beyond the scope of this lesson and will
                               be introduced later.
                               C is incorrect. Treasury bonds are issued by sovereign issuers.

   Institutional investors have expressed concern about increased credit risk due
   to Digistrype’s planned expansion outside of its core business. Digistrype’s CFO
   would prefer to fund the expansion using debt, despite an expectation of lower
   market interest rates in the next few years. The CFO is also considering removing
   the conversion feature because of a concern about the possible share dilution if
   the bonds are converted to equity and a belief that DILO shares are significantly
   undervalued.

1. Which of the following statements best describes the type of bonds to be issued
   given the issuer’s country and where the bonds will be issued and traded?
   A. Since Digistrype is planning to issue and sell euro-denominated bonds, its
      bonds would be considered Eurobonds.

   B. Since Digistrype is planning to issue and sell euro-denominated bonds to
      investors in Germany, its bonds would be considered foreign bonds.

   C. Since Digistrype is planning to issue and sell bonds to domestic investors in
      Germany, its bonds would be considered domestic bonds.

                         2. Which of the following modifications could Digistrype incorporate to best miti-
                            gate the investors’ credit concerns?
                             A. Digistrype could consider deferred debt coupons and/or principal payments.

                             B. Digistrype could consider adding a call provision to its new debt.

                             C. Digistrype could consider accelerating principal repayment or linking debt
                                coupon changes to financial covenants.

                         3. Which of the following is the best contingency feature Digistrype could add to
                            mitigate its own concerns regarding lower interest rates?
                             A. Add a call provision to the proposed new debt.

                             B. Add a put provision to the proposed new debt.

                             C. Add a step-up coupon to the proposed new debt.

                         4. If DILO’s share price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange were to rise to EUR75, the
                            bond’s conversion value would be:
                             A. EUR1,000.

                             B. EUR15,000.

                             C. EUR75,000.

                         5. Which of the following statements best describes the implications of removing
                            the conversion feature from the bond?
                             A. Removal of the conversion feature would likely result in a higher coupon.

                             B. Removal of the conversion feature would likely increase the bond price.

                             C. Removal of the conversion feature would likely reduce credit risk.

Solutions                                                                                 53




   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. Digistrype, a Canadian firm, is planning to issue and sell
   euro-denominated bonds to investors in Germany. Bonds issued by entities that
   are incorporated in another country are called foreign bonds.
   A is incorrect because Eurobonds are cross-border bonds that are not necessarily
   denominated in euros.
   C is incorrect because domestic bonds refer to a domestic issuer, not investor.

2. C is correct. Principal repayment acceleration, such as full amortization, partial
   principal amortization, or a sinking fund arrangement, is a way to reduce credit
   risk. Alternatively, Digistrype could incorporate debt coupon changes linked to
   financial covenants and/or credit ratings in order to address investor concerns.
   A is incorrect because it would delay rather than accelerate repayment.
   B is incorrect because a call provision does not address credit concerns.

3. A is correct. A call provision gives Digistrype the right to redeem all or part of
   the bond prior to maturity if interest rates decline, so new debt could be issued at
   a lower cost.
   B is incorrect because a put provision grants investors, not issuers, the right to
   redeem debt prior to maturity but would not be exercised if interest rates fell,
   because a put provision is intended to limit investor’s downside, not upside.
   C is incorrect; a step-up coupon is not a contingency provision.

4. A is correct. The conversion value of a bond equals its par value if the current
   share price and conversion price are equal.
   Conversion ratio = Convertible bond par value/Conversion price.
   We know that
   Conversion value = Conversion ratio × Current share price.
   Or, after rearranging,
   Conversion ratio = Conversion value/Current share price,
   which can be substituted into the lefthand side of the first equation:
   Conversion value/Current share price
   = Convertible bond par value/Conversion price.

   If Current share price = Conversion price, then Conversion value
   = Convertible bond par value.

5. A is correct. Because the conversion provision is valuable to bondholders, the
   convertible bond price is higher than the price of an otherwise similar bond
   without the conversion provision. Similarly, the yield on a convertible bond is
   lower than the yield on an otherwise similar non-convertible bond. Thus, should
   the Digistrype team elect to remove the conversion feature, it would likely have
   to increase the bond’s coupon rate in order to attract investors.
   B is incorrect because removal of the conversion feature would decrease, not
   increase, the bond price.
   C is incorrect because removal of the conversion feature would not change the
   credit risk.

Fixed-Income Issuance and Trading
 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              describe fixed-income market segments and their issuer and investor
              participants
              describe types of fixed-income indexes
              compare primary and secondary fixed-income markets to equity
              markets




INTRODUCTION
Fixed-income instruments and markets are often categorized by issuer type, credit
                                                                                           1
quality, time to maturity, and, sometimes, additional features, such as currency, geog-
raphy, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) characteristics. Fixed-income
indexes are categorized in a similar manner and serve important functions, like the role
of equity market indexes in stock markets. Like other financial markets, fixed-income
markets are composed of primary markets in which issuers raise financing from
investors with new issues and secondary markets where investors trade existing
instruments with other investors. Given bonds’ finite maturities and other features,
there are important distinctions in fixed-income markets from the primary and sec-
ondary markets for equities.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Fixed-income instruments and markets are typically catego-
          rized along three dimensions: issuer type (i.e., sector), credit
          quality, and time to maturity.
      ■   Fixed-income investors have corresponding positions along the credit
          and maturity spectrum as they seek exposures to certain risks and
          attempt to match the cash flows of known future obligations.
      ■   Similar to equity market indexes, fixed-income indexes track the
          returns of groups of securities that meet their inclusion criteria.
          Indexes are used to evaluate market performance, benchmark the per-
          formance of investments and investment managers, and form the basis
          of indexed investment strategies.

56   Learning Module 3                                                     Fixed-Income Issuance and Trading


                                ■   Fixed-income indexes can be classified as broad-based, aggregate
                                    indexes with a vast number of constituents or narrower indexes
                                    that focus on criteria such as issuer type, credit quality, and time to
                                    maturity.
                                ■   Primary bond markets are markets in which an issuer sells a new bond
                                    or bonds to investors to raise financing, whereas secondary bond mar-
                                    kets are markets in which existing bonds are traded among investors.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                            These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                            of understanding of this learning module.

                            1. Discuss two ways that an investor could seek to increase her expected return
                               on a fixed-income portfolio.
                               Solution:
                               Investors could increase credit risk with instruments with lower credit rat-
                               ings. Second, provided that the yield curve is upward sloping, investors may
                               also increase expected returns with longer-term bonds.

                            2. Which of the following statements about fixed-income and equity indexes is
                               correct?
                               A. There is more turnover in equity indexes than in fixed-income indexes.
                               B. Fixed-income indexes often have more constituent securities than
                                  equity indexes.
                                C. Fixed-income index constituents are typically equally weighted, while
                                   equity index constituents are typically weighted by issuers’ market
                                   capitalization.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Fixed-income indexes often have more constituent securities
                               than equity indexes because issuers tend to have many types of instru-
                               ments outstanding, and governments issue large amounts of fixed-income
                               securities but not equity securities. The finite maturity of bonds and the
                               higher frequency of new issuance lead to far more turnover in fixed-income
                               indexes than in equity indexes. Fixed-income index constituents are usually
                               weighted by market value of debt outstanding, whereas equity indexes are
                               weighted by issuers’ market capitalizations.

                            3. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index includes:
                               A. all issuer sizes.
                               B. issuers in multiple currencies.
                                C. high-yield and unrated issuers.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index includes
                               fixed-coupon capital market securities from all major issuer types in 28
                               developed and emerging markets that meet the inclusion criteria. However,
                               the index excludes high-yield and unrated debt instruments and those that
                               do not meet minimum issuance size.

  4. A debut issuer seeking to sell its bonds only to a select group of investors
     will most likely undertake a:
      A. public offering.
      B. shelf registration.
      C. private placement.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Bonds can be sold via a private placement, in which only a
     select group of investors or a single investor purchases the bonds. Bonds can
     also be sold in a public offering in which any member of the public may buy
     the bonds. Frequent bond issuers use a shelf registration, which is updated
     regularly and may be used for a range of future bond issuances.

  5. A frequent bond issuer that seeks flexibility to issue bonds opportunistically
     when market conditions are favorable would most likely use a:
      A. reopening.
      B. shelf offering.
      C. private placement.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Frequent issuers of bonds have ready access to the bond market
     and often choose issuance timing on an opportunistic basis, when market
     conditions are most favorable. Frequent bond issuers use a shelf registration
     or a broad, all-encompassing offering circular that is updated regularly and
     may be used for a range of future bond issuances. A less common strategy
     is to increase the size of an existing bond with a price significantly different
     from par, which is referred to as the reopening of an existing bond. In a
     private placement, only a selected investor or group of investors may buy
     the bonds.

Fixed-income instruments and markets are typically categorized along three dimen-
sions: issuer type (often known as sector), credit quality, and time to maturity.
Sometimes, instruments and markets are additionally classified by issuers’ geography,
currency, and ESG characteristics.
    In contrast to equities, where issuers typically issue just one or two instruments,
issuers often have many fixed-income instruments outstanding. For example, a cor-
porate issuer may have loans or both loans and bonds, either on a short-term basis
to finance working capital or a long-term basis for capital investment. Some large
companies also issue commercial paper, a type of short-term bond to finance work-
ing capital needs that can be collateralized by specific assets. These debt instruments

                         may be in varying currencies to hedge exposures and broaden access to investors. For
                         example, at the end of 2021, Apple Inc. had over 80 fixed-income instruments but a
                         single equity instrument (common stock) outstanding.

                         Fixed-income investors have corresponding positions along the credit and maturity
                         spectrums as they seek to gain exposures to certain risks and to match the cash flows
                         of known future obligations. Near-term obligations and the desire for liquid cash
                         alternatives are often met with money market securities, while investors may assume
                         greater interest rate risk with long-term bonds to meet obligations further in the
                         future or pursue higher expected returns. Pension funds and insurance companies
                         with long investment time horizons favor fixed-income instruments with fixed peri-
                         odic coupon cash flows and a maturity profile that matches their long-term liabilities.
                         Additionally, investors may take credit risk at any point on the maturity spectrum to
                         augment returns. Exhibit 2 illustrates common investor positions across the credit
                         and maturity spectrums.

             Quality




A common measure of credit quality is a credit rating. Credit ratings are letter-grade,
qualitative measures of an issuer’s ability to meet its debt obligations based on both the
probability of default and the expected loss under a default scenario. Credit ratings are
given and maintained by credit rating agencies for both short-term and long-term
debt and for issuers and specific bond issues. Two of the largest credit rating agencies
are Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s. Many investors are restricted to instruments
with credit ratings, with a limited percentage of their portfolio invested in unrated
instruments. Credit risk and credit ratings will be discussed in detail in later lessons.

S&P CREDIT RATINGS

   S&P ratings range from AAA for the highest credit quality to D for default, with
   ratings in descending order of credit quality as follows:

                              Issuers rated BBB- (Baa3 on Moody’s scale) or higher are considered investment
                         grade. Issuers rated BB+ (Ba1 on Moody’s scale) or lower are referred to as high yield,
                         speculative grade, or junk. High-yield issuers include new issuers for which investors
                         are more likely to require collateral due to less stable operating cash flows, as well
                         as formerly investment-grade issuers whose credit quality has deteriorated since the

  BRWA is an example of an investment-grade corporate issuer with ready access
  to unsecured debt across maturities and markets as well as in different currencies
  either directly or through its affiliates. It uses commercial paper to meet its short-
  term or seasonal working capital needs, intermediate-term debt to cover more
  permanent working capital or medium-term investments, and long-term debt to
  match the longer useful life of capital investments, such as new manufacturing
  equipment or factories. BRWA pays a fee to a group (or syndicate) of banks
  for two credit facilities, which are loan agreements with pre-specified terms
  and limits but with fluctuating balances based on borrower-specific needs at
  different points in time, analogous to a credit card. The first is a 364-day facility
  which backs the commercial paper program, and the second is a longer-term
  revolving credit facility.

    The combination of domestic and cross-border operating, financing, and leasing
activities in Example 1 leads many of BRWA’s real-world industry peers to have hun-
dreds of unique debt instruments outstanding across all affiliates. We may contrast
the BRWA example with VIVU, the digital media company introduced in an earlier
module that has fewer fixed assets, less stable operating cash flows, and, therefore,
limited access to fixed-income markets.

  VIVU is an example of a high-yield corporate issuer that has limited access to
  secured debt across shorter maturities. VIVU has no access to the unsecured
  commercial paper market but, rather, relies on partially drawn secured working
  capital and credit facilities from banks to meet its short-term needs. VIVU has
  a fully drawn loan (Term Loan A) that has a floating-rate coupon equal to MRR
  plus a fixed credit spread. VIVU also has seven-year callable notes outstanding
  under which it has the right to redeem the notes at a fixed price starting three
  years from issuance.

    Sovereign government issuers typically have the lowest credit risk (highest credit
rating) in each market, due to sovereign governments’ right to tax economic activity.
Developed market sovereign bonds are often widely held by both foreign investors and
foreign central banks seeking to hold reserves in the developed market’s currency in
the form of an interest-bearing asset. Sovereign bonds also serve important functions

                         in the domestic financial system. Central banks often use domestic sovereign bonds
                         to conduct monetary policy, borrowing or lending these securities to increase or
                         decrease monetary reserves.
                             Investment-grade bond investors expect more stable cash flows, and defaults
                         among investment-grade issuers are relatively rare. Expected returns are therefore
                         lower than those for high-yield bonds and usually comparable or modestly higher than
                         those of sovereign bonds. High-yield investors expect greater return for assuming a
                         higher probability of default and often compare returns to those of equity investments.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. A fixed-income mutual fund that is required to invest in only invest-
                               ment-grade bonds would most likely invest in:
                               A. B rated bonds.
                               B. BB+ rated bonds.
                                C. BBB- rated bonds.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Both B and BB+ rated bonds are considered high-yield bonds.
                               A BBB- rated bond is considered the lowest investment-grade bond.

                            2. New issuers for which investors are likely to require collateral due to more
                               volatile operating cash flows are best categorized as:
                               A. fallen angels.
                               B. high-yield issuers.
                                C. investment-grade issuers.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. High-yield issuers (not investment-grade issuers) include new
                               issuers for which investors are more likely to require collateral due to less
                               stable operating cash flows. Investment-grade issuers whose credit quality
                               has deteriorated since the time of issuance are known as fallen angels.

                            3. A corporate issuer seeking to fund working capital needs would most likely
                               issue:
                               A. commercial paper.
                               B. intermediate-term debt.
                                C. long-term debt.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. A corporate issuer would use commercial paper to meet its
                               short-term or seasonal working capital needs, intermediate-term debt to
                               cover more medium-term investments, and long-term debt or equity to

      B. long-term callable bonds.
      C. unsecured commercial paper.
     Solution:
     A is correct. A high-yield corporate issuer has limited access to secured debt
     across shorter maturities but has no access to unsecured commercial paper
     or the long-term bond market. (See Example 2.)

  5. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

     Foreign investors in emerging market debt have an expected return that is
     similar to that of developed market sovereign bonds.
     Solution:
     False. Foreign investors in emerging market debt expect a return above that
     of developed market sovereign bonds in exchange for holding bonds with
     lower credit quality and higher risk related to currency fluctuations.




FIXED-INCOME INDEXES
                                                                                           3
              describe types of fixed-income indexes

An earlier module highlighted the role of market indexes in tracking the broad risk
and return of different security markets, which enable the evaluation of market per-
formance, benchmarking the performance of investments and investment managers,
and forming the basis for indexed investment strategies. Fixed-income indexes perform
a similar function in bond markets as equity indexes in stock markets but differ in
three important ways from their equity counterparts.
   1. A single issuer may have many individual fixed-income securities out-
      standing. All bonds that meet index eligibility requirements are included in
      indexes, causing fixed-income indexes to have many more constituent secu-
      rities than equity indexes have. Some indexes have over 10,000 constituents.
   2. The finite maturity of bonds and the higher frequency of new issuance lead
      to far more changes in constituents (turnover) in fixed-income indexes than
      in equity indexes. Bond indexes are usually rebalanced each month to both
      add new issues and remove those that fall below a minimum maturity.
   3. Analogous to equity indexes weighted by issuers’ market capitalization,
      bond index constituents are usually weighted by market value of debt
      outstanding. Since bonds are issued by many types of issuers, broad bond
      indexes will reflect changes to bond market composition over time—for
      example, increases in public versus private issuer debt, longer maturities,
      and deterioration in credit quality. Government issuers are large bond issu-
      ers, so many broad bond indexes have high weights of government debt.
    If a bond fund aims to match the returns of a specific index, it will typically hold
a representative sample of constituent securities in order to match index returns
because the complexity of bond indexes makes it impossible to purchase all the con-
stituent securities.

                             Fixed-income indexes can be classified as aggregate indexes, with a vast number of
                         constituents, or narrower indexes, based on criteria such as sector, credit quality, time
                         to maturity, geography, and ESG considerations. The choice of index for investment
                         manager performance evaluation is important and will be discussed in detail later in
                         the curriculum, but generally speaking, the index chosen to evaluate an investment
                         manager or fund should correspond to that manager’s or fund’s investment strategy. For
                         example, Baywhite’s Short-Term Bond Fund invests in short-term, investment-grade
                         bonds. To evaluate the fund, its returns should be compared to an index of instruments
                         with similar maturity and credit quality.
                             The following three exhibits illustrate fixed-income indexes and their use by
                         investors.

                            markets that meet the above inclusion criteria. However, the index excludes
                            high-yield and unrated debt instruments and those that do not meet minimum
                            issuance size.

    The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index might be appropriate to use to
evaluate Baywhite Financial’s Core Bond Fund since it includes investment-grade,
longer-term bonds from a variety of sectors. However, if Baywhite invests in only a
single market, such as Japan, a more appropriate benchmark would be the Bloomberg
Barclays Japanese Aggregate Index.
    The J.P. Morgan EMBI+ Index in Exhibit 4 is a more narrowly defined fixed-income
index that includes US dollar–denominated debt of sovereign governments at or below
a certain credit quality of a minimum issuance size and maturity. The focus on foreign
debt of lower credit quality targets a higher US dollar–based return than for developed
market sovereign bonds while assuming the external debt risk of issuer countries.

Bond investors seeking to incorporate ESG considerations into fixed-income investment
decisions frequently use bond indexes that regularly screen for and exclude issuers
that fail to meet certain minimum ESG criteria. For example, the Bloomberg Barclays
MSCI Euro Corporate Sustainable SRI Index (see Exhibit 5) filters by sector, currency,
credit quality, time to maturity, and ESG considerations, such as a minimum ESG
rating and exclusion of issuers involved in certain business activities.

                               ing Baywhite’s Short-Term Bond Fund?

                               An index composed primarily of:
                                A. high-yield short-term bonds.
                                B. investment-grade short-term bonds.

Fixed-Income Indexes                                                                    69


      C. investment-grade bonds with more than five years to maturity.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Baywhite’s Short-Term Bond Fund invests in investment-grade,
     short-term bonds. To evaluate this fund, its returns should be compared to
     those of an index of similar maturity and credit instruments.

  2. Match the characteristics on the right with the indexes on the left.
                                           ​




    A. Broad equity index                      I. Includes sovereign issuers
    B. Broad bond index                        II. Less frequent rebalancing
                                               III. Easier to fully replicate
                                               IV. Larger number of constituents
                                           ​




     Solution:

      A. II and III
      B. I and IV

  3. Relative to equity indexes, fixed-income indexes exhibit more turnover due
     to:
      A. annual rebalancing.
      B. the finite maturity of bonds.
      C. the lower frequency of new issues.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The finite maturity of bonds and the higher frequency of new
     issuance leads to far more turnover in fixed-income indexes than in equity
     indexes. Bond indexes are usually rebalanced each month to both add new
     issues and remove those that fall below a minimum maturity.

  4. The composition of broad bond indexes will most likely change due to
     changes in:
      A. the maturity mix of issuers only.
      B. the proportion of public versus private issuers only.
      C. both the maturity mix of issuers and the proportion of public versus
         private issuers.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Since bonds are issued by many types of issuers, broad bond
     indexes will reflect changes to bond market composition over time—for ex-
     ample, increases in public versus private issuer debt, longer maturities, and
     deterioration in credit quality.

             4           PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FIXED-INCOME MARKETS

                                         compare primary and secondary fixed-income markets to equity
                                         markets



                         Primary Fixed-Income Markets
                         Primary bond markets are markets in which an issuer sells a new bond or bonds
                         to investors to raise capital. In contrast, secondary bond markets are markets in
                         which existing bonds are traded among investors. As in the case of an IPO for equity
                         investors, an issuer approaching the bond market for the first time (often referred
                         to as a debut issuer) represents the first opportunity for a fixed-income investor
                         to purchase an issuer’s bonds. Bonds can be sold via a public offering, in which any
                         member of the public may buy the bonds, or via a private placement, in which only a
                         selected investor or group of investors may buy the bonds. Similar to primary equity
                         issuance, which typically involves a transfer from private to public ownership, a debut
                         issuer is often replacing private debt, such as a bank loan, with bonds. Examples of
                         debut bond issuers include
                             ■    new corporate legal entities formed after a merger, acquisition, or divesti-
                                  ture, which usually refinance all existing debt outstanding;
                             ■    companies that reach a more mature stage of the life cycle with more pre-
                                  dictable cash flows and begin issuing debt; and
                             ■    sovereign governments that raise external foreign currency debt for the first
                                  time.
                             For debut issuers that must complete the respective domestic market or Eurobond
                         registration process, the underwriters usually conduct roadshows and other information
                         sessions for a period of several weeks prior to issuance to familiarize potential inves-
                         tors with the new entity and its uses of and sources for repayment for the new bond.
                             For repeat issuers of fixed-income securities, the process is far more abbreviated
                         than for debut issuers and for follow-on offerings of equities. Whereas publicly traded
                         companies that return to the equity market to increase their shares outstanding do
                         so under an identical instrument, fixed-income issuers usually issue a new security
                         priced at or close to par. A less common strategy is to increase the size of an existing
                         bond with a price significantly different from par, which is referred to as the reopen-
                         ing of an existing bond.
                             For example, unsecured investment-grade issuance of new corporate bonds usu-
                         ally takes place within a several-hour period, as shown in the diagram and timeline
                         in Exhibit 6.

    Exhibit 6 is an example of an underwritten bond offering in which one or more
financial intermediaries (or underwriters) guarantee the sale of the bond issue at
an offering price that is negotiated with the issuer. Investors in such bonds (e.g.,
Baywhite) are usually very familiar with the bond indenture and financial statements
of these frequent issuers. As in the case of BRWA earlier in this module, issuers of
such bonds have ready access to the bond market and often choose issuance timing
on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are most favorable. Underwriters
seek to manage the bond order book to ensure the greatest availability to large institu-
tional investors at the lowest possible spread across maturities. Frequent bond issuers
use a shelf registration or a broad, all-encompassing offering circular that is updated
regularly and may be used for a range of future bond issuances.
    Secured bond issuance among corporate high-yield, some special purpose entities,
and other issuers (e.g., VIVU) is usually a longer and more involved process than
for unsecured investment-grade bonds. Investors must familiarize themselves with
unique and more complex covenants, as well as the use of both operating cash flows
and collateral as sources of bond repayment. For bonds of lower credit quality, the
financial intermediary does not guarantee the sale and may serve only as a broker in
a best-efforts offering. That is, it tries to sell the bond issue on a commission basis at
the negotiated price only if it can do so.
    In instances where the bond size is small, the issuer is less well known, or the
terms are more customized, a bond might take the form of a private placement or
non-underwritten, unregistered offering of bonds sold only to a small group of investors.
    Primary market issuance of sovereign debt usually takes the form of a public
auction led by the national treasury or finance ministry, which are discussed in detail
in a later module.

                         Secondary Fixed-Income Markets
                         While progress continues to be made by various electronic marketplace platforms,
                         such as MarketAxess and Tradeweb, fixed-income markets are mostly quote-driven
                         or over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Major participants in secondary bond market
                         trading include institutional investors (such as the Baywhite funds introduced earlier),
                         financial intermediaries, and central banks.
                             Secondary bond market liquidity varies widely across fixed-income market seg-
                         ments and even among bonds outstanding from a single issuer. The bid–offer spread
                         or difference in price at which a dealer will buy (or bid) from a customer and sell (or
                         offer) to a customer is a key liquidity measure. This spread is often quoted in basis
                         points in fixed-income markets.
                             The most recently issued, or on-the-run, developed market sovereign bonds are
                         typically the most liquid fixed-income securities, with primary dealers making active
                         markets in large size with bid–offer spreads equal to a fraction of a basis point. In
                         some markets, such as Australia, domestic sovereign government bonds are traded
                         on an exchange. Among corporate issuers, recently issued corporate bonds from
                         frequent issuers of higher credit quality usually exhibit the greatest liquidity and
                         tightest bid–offer spreads. Underwriters and other dealers are more likely to hold
                         trading inventory in recent issues and may therefore quote bid-offer spreads of a few
                         basis points. Bonds of less frequent corporate issuers or more seasoned bonds of fre-
                         quent issuers are rarely traded, leading dealers to quote bid–offer spreads of at least
                         10–20 basis points or more for small sizes. One exception that can increase trading
                         frequency of a seasoned issue is a significant deterioration in a bond’s credit quality,
                         as in the following example.

                          EXAMPLE 4

                            Hertz Corporation
                            Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (Hertz) is a US-based car rental company that filed
                            for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 2020 amid the initial outbreak of
                            COVID-19 in the United States. Hertz’s bonds maturing in 2022 and 2028 were
                            trading at an average of less than 10% of par value, a decline of more than 90%
                            from three months earlier. However, a year later, the bonds rose back to their
                            pre-pandemic price as the company exited bankruptcy through a reorganization
                            with outside investors that kept these bonds intact.
                            Source: Bloomberg News

                              Bonds of issuers believed to be very close to or in bankruptcy, as in the previous
                         example, are referred to as distressed debt. Distressed debt typically trades in the
                         secondary market at a price well below par, because bondholders are unlikely to receive
                         all promised future interest and principal payments. Investors with policies limiting
                         their bond investments to highly rated securities may be forced to sell distressed debt,
                         while hedge funds and other opportunistic investors seeking more equity-like returns
                         (from price appreciation) are often the buyers of distressed bonds. Distressed debt
                         is traded until either the corporate issuer has liquidated its assets or its outstanding
                         bonds have been restructured. In contrast, an equity security may be removed or
                         delisted from secondary trading on an exchange if it fails to meet the listing require-
                         ments of the exchange, which often include minimum share prices, net worth, and
                         free float. By the time an issuer’s debt has become distressed, its equity securities will
                         likely have already been delisted.

   Finally, many bond issues do not trade at all on a regular basis. Price quotes from
dealers or on platforms such as Bloomberg for illiquid bonds often rely on estimates
derived from more liquid bonds of similar credit quality and maturity, a process
covered in a later module.

QUESTION SET


  1. A bond issuance by a company after it has reached a more mature
     stage of the life cycle with more predictable cash flows would be best consid-
     ered a:
      A. private placement.
      B. primary fixed-income market transaction.
      C. secondary fixed-income market transaction.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Primary bond markets are markets in which an issuer sells a
     new bond or bonds to investors to raise capital. Secondary bond markets are
     markets in which existing bonds are traded among investors. Bonds can be
     sold via a private placement, in which only a selected investor or group of
     investors may buy the bonds.

  2. Which of the following statements about debut issuers is correct?
      A. A debut issuer typically replaces bank loans with bonds.
      B. Debut issuers transfer ownership from public to private markets.
      C. Debut issuers offer bonds in a public offering, not a private placement.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Similar to primary equity issuance, which typically involves a
     transfer from private to public ownership, a first-time bond issuer is often
     replacing private debt, such as a bank loan, with bonds.
     B is incorrect. Fixed-income securities have no voting or control rights, and
     debut issues represent a private to public (not public to private) transition.
     C is incorrect. A debut issuer can offer bonds in either a public offering or a
     private placement.

  3. Relative to unsecured issuers, secured issuers most likely experience an issu-
     ance timeline that is:
      A. shorter.
      B. the same.
      C. longer.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Secured bond issuance among corporate high-yield, some spe-
     cial purpose entities, and other issuers (e.g., VIVU) is usually a longer and
     more involved process than for unsecured investment-grade bonds. Inves-
     tors must familiarize themselves with unique and more complex covenants,
     as well as the use of both operating cash flows and collateral as sources of
     bond repayment.

                            4. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

                               Secondary fixed-income markets consist mostly of quote-driven or over-
                               the-counter markets, while secondary trading for listed equity markets
                               primarily occurs on an electronic exchange.
                               Solution:
                               True. Unlike listed equities, for which secondary trading largely occurs on
                               an electronic exchange, fixed-income markets consist mostly of quote-driv-
                               en or over-the-counter markets.

                            5. For a firm in distress, its bonds will most likely stop trading:
                               A. before the firm’s equity.
                               B. at the same time as the firm’s equity.
                                C. after the firm’s equity.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Distressed debt is traded until either the corporate issuer has
                               liquidated its assets or its outstanding bonds have been restructured. In con-
                               trast, an equity security may be removed or delisted from secondary trading
                               on an exchange if it fails to meet the listing requirements of the exchange,
                               which often include minimum share prices, net worth, and free float. By the
                               time an issuer’s debt has become distressed, its equity securities will likely
                               have already been delisted.

                         2. C is correct. Sovereign government issuers typically have the lowest credit risk
                            (highest credit rating) in each market, due to sovereign governments’ right to tax
                            economic activity. High-yield issuers have below-investment-grade credit ratings
                            (BBB- or below), while distressed issuers typically have high-yield ratings or are
                            in default.

                         3. C is correct. Mutual funds and ETFs that track this benchmark index offer
                            comprehensive exposure to many fixed-income markets with no active security
                            selection and portfolio turnover limited solely to either new issuance or issues no
                            longer meeting inclusion criteria.

                         4. A is correct. Increasing the size of an existing bond with a price significantly
                            different from par is referred to as the reopening of an existing bond. A private
                            placement refers to bonds being sold to a selected investor or group of investors,
                            versus a sale to the public. Bonds of issuers believed to be very close to or in
                            bankruptcy are referred to as distressed.

                         5. B is correct. Bonds of less frequent corporate issuers or more seasoned bonds
                            of frequent issuers are rarely traded, leading dealers to quote bid–offer spreads
                            of at least 10–20 basis points or more for small sizes. The most recently issued,
                            or on-the-run, developed market sovereign bonds are typically the most liquid
                            fixed-income securities, with primary dealers making active markets in large size
                            with bid–offer spreads equal to a fraction of a basis point. Among corporate issu-
                            ers, recently issued corporate bonds from frequent issuers of higher credit quality
                            usually exhibit the greatest liquidity and tightest bid–offer spreads.

INTRODUCTION
Previous modules described various types of fixed-income issuers and investors. In
                                                                                        1
this module, we focus on the corporate fixed-income sector, composed of instru-
ments issued by financial institutions and non-financial corporate issuers across the
time-to-maturity and credit spectrums. These instruments account for a significant
portion of total debt issuance and debt outstanding globally.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Non-financial corporations frequently use short-term external
          funding in the form of bank loans and securities, such as com-
          mercial paper to meet cash needs.
      ■   Financial institutions rely on deposits, interbank markets, commercial
          paper, and repurchase agreements (repos) as primary sources of short-
          term funding.
      ■   Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued
          by both financial institutions and non-financial corporations.
      ■   A repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term secured lend-
          ing that involves the sale and simultaneous agreement to buy back a
          security at a pre-agreed future price.

                                ■   An investment-grade bond has a significant proportion of its
                                    yield-to-maturity (YTM) attributed to the government benchmark
                                    yield due to its strong ability to meet promised interest and principal
                                    obligations from operating cash flows.
                                ■   High-yield issuers are characterized by a higher expected likelihood
                                    of financial distress. Relative to investment-grade bonds, a higher pro-
                                    portion of their bonds’ YTM is attributed to an issuer-specific spread
                                    over the government benchmark yield.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                            These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                            of understanding of this learning module.

                            1. Which of the following financing instruments provides the most reliable
                               source of short-term bank funding for a non-financial corporation?
                                A. Revolving credit agreement
                                B. Committed bank line of credit
                                C. Uncommitted bank line of credit
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Revolving credit agreements, also referred to as revolvers, are
                               the most reliable source of short-term bank funding.
                               B is incorrect. While committed lines of credit are a more reliable source
                               of financing than uncommitted lines because they involve a formal written
                               commitment, they are less reliable than revolvers. C is incorrect because
                               uncommitted bank lines of credit are the least reliable form of bank borrow-
                               ing for a company.

                            2. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

                               In an unsecured loan, the lender requires the company to provide collateral
                               in the form of an asset that is pledged against the loan.
                               Solution:
                               False. Secured loans are loans in which the lender requires the company to
                               provide collateral in the form of an asset, such as a fixed asset that the com-
                               pany owns or high-quality receivables or inventory. These assets are pledged
                               against the loan, and the lender files a security interest against them. This
                               pledge or lien is added to the borrowing company’s financial record and
                               reflected on its credit report. Companies that lack sufficient credit quality to
                               qualify for unsecured loans may attempt to obtain secured loans.

                            3. Relative to long-term debt and equity, repo funding provides which of the
                               following benefits to a financial institution?
                                A. Lower cost
                                B. Longer-term financing
                                C. Greater financial flexibility
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Financial institutions must balance the low cost of repo funding
                               with the greater financial flexibility of more costly longer-term financing al-

Introduction                                                                            79


     ternatives, such as long-term debt and equity. B and C are incorrect because
     they are both benefits of long-term debt and equity.

  4. Venus, Inc., a financial institution, and Bank A, a large regional bank, enter
     into a repurchase agreement in which Venus is the security seller and Bank
     A is the security buyer. The repo is subject to a 102% initial margin. Which
     of the following statements is correct?
      A. Bank A benefits from a long-term cash investment on a collateralized
         basis with minimal liquidity risk.
      B. Bank A could generate higher returns for longer repo terms and/or by
         accepting less liquid or lower-quality collateral.
      C. The repo transaction reduces Venus’s funding requirement for the
         security to a fraction of the bond’s purchase price.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Short-term repos with high-quality collateral (lowest risk)
     result in the lowest return; however, investors can expect higher returns for
     longer repo terms and/or by accepting less liquid or lower quality collateral.
     A is incorrect because Bank A benefits from a short-term (not long-term)
     cash investment on a collateralized basis with minimal liquidity risk.
     C is incorrect because the repo transaction reduces Bank A’s (not Venus’s)
     funding requirement for the security to a fraction of the bond’s purchase
     price due to the 102% initial margin.

  5. An investor is analyzing three bonds for a potential investment: a AA rated
     bond, a B rated bond, and a CCC rated bond. Which of the bonds is most
     appropriate if the investor is seeking safety with few issuer restrictions?
      A. AA rated bond
      B. B rated bond
      C. CCC rated bond
     Solution:
     A is correct. The AA rated bond is investment grade with low likelihood of
     default and minimal issuer restrictions. B and C are incorrect because the B
     rated and CCC rated bonds are considered high yield with equity-like risk
     attributes and often greater issuer restrictions.

  6. A bond analyst would most likely consider the probability of default and loss
     given default for:
      A. an investment-grade bond because of its equity-like cash flow.
      B. a high-yield bond because of its higher expected likelihood of financial
         distress.
      C. an investment-grade bond because of the importance of financial
         ratios and credit ratings to determine the issuer’s likelihood of default.
     Solution:
     B is correct. High-yield issuers are characterized by a higher expected
     likelihood of financial distress. Given the higher chance of default, these
     instruments are more equity-like in nature and analysts place a greater em-
     phasis on the likelihood (probability) of default, potential loss given default,
     and the protections and secondary repayment sources that are available. A
     is incorrect because investment-grade bonds exhibit bond-like cash flows,
     for which there is a high probability of receiving the agreed-upon interest

                                 and principal payments. C is incorrect because investment-grade bond
                                 analysts use financial ratios and credit ratings to determine if and when an
                                 investment-grade issuer’s likelihood of default will change and don’t rely on
                                 probability of default or loss given default measures.




             2           SHORT-TERM FUNDING ALTERNATIVES

                                              compare short-term funding alternatives available to corporations
                                              and financial institutions

                         Both non-financial corporations and financial institutions rely on borrowed capital
                         to support their short-term activities. As discussed in an earlier module in the cor-
                         porate issuers reading, corporations use external short-term financing to meet cash
                         needs during their cash conversion cycle, preserve liquidity, and take advantage of
                         supplier discounts.
                             Non-financial corporate sources and uses of short-term funding are summarized
                         in Exhibit 1.

                         External Loan Financing
                         Non-financial corporations often rely on financial intermediaries for short-term
                         financing. Common instruments include
                             ■    uncommitted bank lines of credit,
                             ■    committed bank lines of credit, and
                             ■    revolving credit agreements, or revolvers.

Short-Term Funding Alternatives                                                             81


    These can be unsecured or secured, depending on a company’s financial strength,
general credit situation, and jurisdiction. Uncommitted lines and revolvers are used
more frequently in the United States, whereas regular committed lines are more
common elsewhere. Credit lines typically offer the most flexible and immediate access
to short-term funding.

Lines of Credit
Uncommitted lines of credit are the least reliable form of bank borrowing for a com-
pany, as the name suggests. A bank offers uncommitted credit lines up to a certain
principal amount (“credit line”) for a pre-determined maximum maturity, charging a
base or market reference rate (MRR) plus an issuer-specific spread on only the prin-
cipal outstanding for the period of use. Under normal business conditions, companies
often find uncommitted bank credit lines to be the most flexible and least costly means
of external funding. Banks usually offer these lines on an unsecured basis to clients
who maintain stable cash deposits at the bank, allowing the banks to closely monitor
and react to adverse borrower developments, such as declining account balances.
Uncommitted credit lines require minimal capital reserves until they are drawn down
and used, but banks reserve the right to refuse to honor any request for use of the line.
Firms cannot therefore rely on uncommitted lines as a primary source of funding,
because banks may choose not to lend if business or economic conditions deteriorate.
Alternative funding sources may be difficult to obtain or are prohibitively expensive
at times when uncommitted funding becomes unavailable. The primary attraction of
uncommitted lines is that they do not require the company to pay any compensation
other than interest on balances outstanding to the bank. From a bank perspective,
these uncommitted lines of credit serve as valuable tools to maintain a long-term
business relationship with the borrower through which the bank can monitor borrower
activity. Funding for these lines often comes from stable deposits that the bank holds,
allowing it to finance these lines using funds that depositors do not regularly touch.
     Committed (regular) lines of credit are a more reliable source of financing than
uncommitted lines because they involve a formal written commitment. Committed
lines require more bank capital than uncommitted lines, although commitments of
less than a year (usually 364 days) minimize a bank’s capital requirement. For larger
corporate borrowers, banks often further reduce the committed capital needed to
support the line by forming a group of banks or a syndicate, which involves a mutual
agreement to accept a pre-determined percentage of the total credit commitment and
loan drawdown over time. When drawn, regular credit lines are short-term liabili-
ties, usually classified as notes payable or the equivalent. Undrawn committed lines
are sometimes used as a source of backup credit for other financing forms, such as
short-term securities, as shown later.
     Regular lines are unsecured and prepayable without penalty. Although they are a
more reliable source of short-term funding than uncommitted lines, these commit-
ments face the risk of renewal at maturity, particularly when heavily used and drawn
by a borrower with weakening credit conditions. Unlike uncommitted lines, regular
lines usually involve upfront costs in the form of a commitment fee (such as 0.50%)
on either the full or unused amount of the line for the commitment period.
     Revolving credit agreements, also referred to as “revolvers” (or “operating lines
of credit”), are the most reliable source of short-term bank funding. These are mul-
tiyear credit commitments and lenders typically seek protections, such as covenants
which require or restrict certain borrower actions as in the case of a bond indenture.
Otherwise, revolvers have similar features to regular lines with respect to borrowing
rates and commitment fees and may also include optional medium-term loan features.

                         Secured Loans and Factoring
                         Secured loans, also called asset-based loans, are loans in which the lender requires
                         the company to provide collateral in the form of an asset, such as a fixed asset that
                         the company owns or high-quality receivables, inventory, or marketable securities.
                         These assets are pledged against the loan, and the lender files a security interest (or
                         right to possess the asset until the loan is repaid) against them. This pledge or lien is
                         added to the borrowing company’s financial record and reflected on its credit report.
                         Companies that lack sufficient credit quality to qualify for unsecured loans might
                         arrange for secured loans.
                             A company can use its accounts receivable to generate cash flow through the
                         assignment of accounts receivable, which is the use of receivables as collateral for a
                         loan. Firms can also sell accounts receivable to a lender, called a factor, typically at
                         a substantial discount. Under an assignment, the company remains responsible for
                         the collection of the accounts, whereas in a factoring arrangement, the company
                         shifts the credit-granting and collection process to the lender or factor. The cost of
                         this credit (i.e., the amount of the discount) depends on the credit quality of the
                         accounts and the collection costs. Similarly, inventory can be used in different ways
                         as collateral for a loan.


                         External, Security-Based Financing
                         For some firms, loans can be more expensive than debt, secured or unsecured, issued
                         in financial markets. Large, highly rated companies can issue short-term, unsecured
                         notes known as commercial paper (CP) in the public market or via a private place-
                         ment. Commercial paper issued by corporations typically matures in less than three
                         months and can be used to fund working capital, seasonal demand for cash, or to
                         provide bridge financing (i.e., interim financing that provides funds until permanent
                         financing can be arranged).
                             In most cases, maturing commercial paper is paid with the proceeds of newly
                         issued commercial paper (or “rolled over”). This practice raises the possibility that an
                         issuer is unable to issue new paper at maturity, known as rollover risk. To minimize
                         rollover risk, investors usually require a committed backup line of credit from banks,
                         also referred to as a liquidity enhancement or backup liquidity lines. The purpose of
                         the backup lines of credit is to ensure that the issuer can fully repay maturing com-
                         mercial paper if a rollover is not possible. Given their short maturity, commercial
                         paper markets adapt quickly to adverse credit events and defaults are relatively rare.
                             Apart from non-financial corporations, the largest commercial paper issuers
                         include financial institutions, governments, and supranational agencies. Commercial
                         paper issued in the international market is known as Eurocommercial paper (ECP).
                         Although similar to United States commercial paper (USCP), typical ECP transaction
                         sizes are much smaller and less liquid than the USCP market.


                         Short-Term Funding Alternatives for Financial Institutions
                         Common bank sources and uses of funding are shown in Exhibit 2. The short-term
                         funding needs of financial institutions, such as banks, arise from their role as interme-
                         diaries between borrowers and depositors. In addition to cash and reserves, most bank
                         assets are loans issued or securities purchased. Liabilities include deposits received
                         from households and firms, securities sold, or short-term borrowing.

Deposits
Household (or retail) and commercial deposits are a primary source of short-term
funding for most banks. These are usually in the form of checking accounts, or
deposits with no stated maturity available for transactional purposes that pay little or
no interest. Although these so-called demand deposit balances may be withdrawn at
any time, fee rebates, uncommitted credit lines, and other services extended by banks
under normal business conditions to their commercial customers allow them to rely
on this stable source to meet both short-term and longer-term funding needs. For
larger depositors, these so-called operational deposits generated by clearing, custody,
and cash management activities are also a relatively stable source of funding, while
rules requiring banks to maintain liquidity reserves against other less stable demand
deposits make them a less attractive funding source.
    Saving deposits are usually held for non-transactional purposes and often have a
stated term. For example, a bank may accept a specific deposit with a pre-determined
maturity and interest rate known as a certificate of deposit (CD). CDs typically have
maturities shorter than one year and pay interest at maturity. A non-negotiable CD
involves payment of principal and interest at maturity to the initial depositor, with a
penalty for early withdrawal. Negotiable CDs allow a depositor to withdraw funds by
selling the CD in the open market prior to maturity. A negotiable CD oriented toward
the retail market is called a small-denomination CD, while large-denomination CDs
are a common source of wholesale funding from institutional investors. As in the case
of CP, CDs are traded in the Eurobond market.

Interbank Market
The interbank market involves short-term borrowing and lending among financial
institutions on a secured or unsecured basis. Unsecured loans and deposits in the
interbank market typically range from overnight to a one-year term at an interest
rate closely tied to a market reference rate. Banks typically factor credit risk into the
interest rate on these loans and deposits and impose counterparty limits as part of
their credit risk management.
    In most countries, banks and other financial institutions are required to maintain
reserves at the central bank. While some banks may have excess funds over the mini-
mum reserve requirement, others may run short of required reserves. This imbalance
is solved through the central bank funds market, allowing banks with a surplus of

                         funds to lend to others. The interest rate at which central bank funds are bought
                         (i.e., borrowed) and sold (i.e., lent) is known as the central bank funds rate. Central
                         banks target a specific rate or range of policy rates and use open market operations
                         or interest paid on reserves to achieve it. A bank unable to borrow in the interbank
                         market may do so directly from the central bank as a last resort (discount window
                         lending), but this is typically associated with posting of collateral with the central
                         bank and may lead to greater central bank oversight that can result in restrictions on
                         the bank’s activities to address the bank’s liquidity issues. Such lending is offered at a
                         higher interest rate than the central bank funds rate.
                              The most common form of secured interbank borrowing and lending involves
                         repurchase agreements addressed in the next lesson.

                         Commercial Paper
                         Commercial paper issuance is dominated by large financial institutions, which use
                         these unsecured notes to meet short-term borrowing needs and in some cases to fund
                         longer-term balance sheet assets, such as loans. Approximately 60% of the annual
                         issuance volume comes from financial institutions, and the remainder comes from
                         non-financial corporate issuers. As in the case of non-financial corporations, banks
                         also face rollover risk to the extent that their funding needs exceed the maturity of
                         commercial paper outstanding.
                             Banks and other financial institutions also commonly use a secured form of com-
                         mercial paper issuance known as asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). Recall
                         from an earlier lesson that in some cases, loans or receivables are sold to a special
                         purpose entity (SPE) that issues debt and makes interest and principal payments from
                         asset cash flows. Exhibit 3 shows an ABCP issuance in two simple steps (asset-backed
                         securities will be covered in detail later). First, a bank agrees to transfer short-term
                         loans to an SPE in exchange for cash. Second, the SPE issues ABCP to investors with
                         a backup credit liquidity line provided by the bank.

                         credit provider) and investors. The bank receives cash when the commercial paper
                         is issued and reduces its capital costs by providing undrawn backup liquidity instead
                         of holding the short-term loans to maturity. Investors purchase a liquid, short-term
                         note with interest and principal payments from a loan portfolio to which they would
                         otherwise not have direct access.

   The ABCP market experienced rapid growth prior to the Global Financial Crisis
due in part to a significant increase in the funding of long-term assets using short-term
notes. However, the inability of many issuers to roll ABCP at the height of the crisis
caused numerous SPEs to fail. Following the crisis, the ABCP market reverted to
primarily funding short-term, generally high-quality loans and receivables.

QUESTION SET


   1. Pennington Corporation is a large pharmaceutical company with
      an investment-grade credit rating and uses Cavalier Bank for some of its
      financing needs. Pennington maintains stable cash deposits at Cavalier Bank
      and is seeking a short-term financing option with no upfront commitment
      fee. Which of the following financing options would be most appropriate for
      Pennington?
      A. Secured loan
      B. Committed bank line of credit
       C. Uncommitted bank line of credit
      Solution:
      C is correct. Banks offer uncommitted lines of credit on an unsecured basis
      to clients who maintain stable cash deposits at the bank, allowing the banks
      to closely monitor and react to adverse borrower developments, such as de-
      clining account balances. Uncommitted lines of credit also have no upfront
      commitment fee and are obtained by stronger companies, such as Penning-
      ton. A is incorrect because secured loans are obtained by companies that
      lack sufficient credit quality to qualify for unsecured loans. B is incorrect
      because committed lines of credit have upfront commitment fees.

   2. Which of the following statements about revolvers is correct?
      A. Revolvers are the least reliable form of bank borrowing for a company.
      B. Revolvers are multiyear credit commitments where lenders typically
         seek covenants that require or restrict certain borrower actions.
       C. Revolvers usually involve upfront costs in the form of a commitment
          fee on either the full or the unused amount of the line for the commit-
          ment period.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Revolvers are multiyear credit commitments in which lend-
      ers typically seek protections, such as covenants, which require or restrict
      certain borrower actions, as in the case of a bond indenture. A is incorrect
      because uncommitted lines of credit are the least reliable form of bank bor-
      rowing for a company. C is incorrect because committed lines of credit, not
      revolvers, usually involve upfront costs in the form of a commitment fee on
      either the full or the unused amount of the line for the commitment period.

   3. Which of the following would a commercial paper issuer most likely obtain
      to minimize rollover risk?
      A. Credit rating
      B. Bridge financing

                                C. Liquidity enhancement
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. To minimize rollover risk, investors usually require a liquidity
                               enhancement to ensure that the issuer can fully repay maturing commercial
                               paper if a rollover is not possible. B is incorrect because bridge financing,
                               which is interim financing that provides funds until permanent financing
                               can be arranged, would require additional issuance of commercial paper
                               by the issuer, increasing rollover risk. A is incorrect because a credit rating
                               does not affect rollover risk.

                            4. Which of the following statements about asset-backed commercial paper is
                               correct?
                                A. This financing is not recorded on the balance sheet of the issuer.
                                B. The bank issues ABCP to investors with a backup credit liquidity line
                                   provided by the SPE.
                                C. Investors purchase an illiquid, short-term note with interest and prin-
                                   cipal payments from the SPE.
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. This financing is not recorded on the balance sheet of the
                               issuer. B is incorrect because the SPE (not the bank) issues ABCP to inves-
                               tors with a backup credit liquidity line provided by the bank. C is incorrect
                               because investors purchase a liquid, short-term note from the SPE.

                         security with a simultaneous agreement by the seller to buy the same (or a similar)
                         security back from the purchaser at an agreed-on repurchase price and future date
                         called the repurchase date. Exhibit 4 shows the mechanics of a simple repurchase
                         agreement.

Assume that today (t = 0) the current US five-year Treasury note trades at a price equal
to the bond’s face value of USD100,000,000. The security buyer takes delivery of the
US Treasury note today and pays the security seller USD100,000,000. If we assume
a repo term of 30 days (and 360 days in a year) and an annual interest rate (or repo
rate) of 0.25%, then the buyer agrees to return the Treasury note 30 days from today
(t = T) to the seller at a repurchase price of USD100,020,833, calculated as follows:
   USD100,000,000 × [1 + (0.25% × 30/360)] = USD100,020,833.
In effect, the security seller borrows USD100,000,000 on a short-term basis at a low
cost, with interest (USD20,833) paid at maturity, because the loan is collateralized
by the US Treasury note.
    The details of repo and other money market interest calculations are addressed in
a later lesson. In a repo transaction, the seller of the security (cash borrower) retains
ownership of the security over the repo term, as well as the interest and actual coupon
paid by the security, while the security buyer (cash lender) receives the repo rate.
    Because cash lenders in the repo market are primarily interested in both the liquidity
and safety of their investments, most repos are typically very short-term transactions
with the highest-quality securities (e.g., sovereign bonds) serving as collateral. Repo
periods range from overnight to so-called term repos, those involving any maturity
longer than one day. The underlying securities used in repo transactions are usually
limited to the most liquid bonds with the lowest credit risk, such as sovereign bonds
of various maturities. Rather than involving a specific security as in Exhibit 4, a repo
transaction may instead reference a specific group of securities as eligible collateral
(such as government bonds of a specific maturity) in what is known as a general
collateral repo transaction. These transactions take place at the general collateral
repo rate.
    In addition to the high quality of underlying securities, repos include features
designed to reduce the risk of a collateral shortfall over the contract life. One such
feature is the provision of collateral in excess of the cash exchanged, known as initial
margin, defined as the following ratio:
                          ​Security Price​0​

                         A 100% initial margin indicates a fully collateralized loan, while a higher margin
                         indicates even greater initial collateral protection. This is alternatively considered
                         a reduction or haircut of the underlying loan relative to the initial collateral value,
                         which may be shown as follows:

                            1. Assume the repurchase agreement in Exhibit 4 is subject to a 102%

                               Calculate the revised original purchase price (loan amount).
                               Solution: Using an initial margin of 102%, we can solve for a revised pur-
                               chase price using Equation 1:

                            2. Calculate the associated repo haircut.
                               Solution: Using Equation 2, solve for the haircut as follows:

                            3. Calculate the repurchase price using the same 30-day repo term and 0.25%

                               Solution: The repurchase price may be calculated as follows:
                                Repurchase price = USD98,039,216× [1 + (0.25% × 30/360)].

                                Repurchase price = USD98,059,641.

                             Repos address collateral value changes by granting contract participants the right

                         interest equal to the original initial margin terms. This variable margin payment
                         (referred to as variation margin) is equal to the difference between current margin
                         required and the security’s price at time t, as shown in Equation 3:
                             	​Variation margin = (​ Initial margin × ​Purchase price​t​)​− ​Security Price​t​.​	   (3)

For example, a security price decline requires a cash borrower (security seller) to
provide additional collateral to the seller.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK


  1. Assume the same repurchase agreement terms from Exhibit 4 and
     the previous Knowledge Check. Calculate the variation margin five days
     after trade inception if the price of the five-year US Treasury note rises to
     103% of the security’s USD100 million face value.
       Solution:
       Recall the original loan amount (or purchase price at t = 0) is equal to
       USD98,039,216, or USD100,000,000/1.02. We may solve for the purchase
       price when t = 5 as follows:
       Purchase price = USD98,039,216× [1 + (0.25% × 5/360)].

       Purchase price = USD98,042,620.
       To calculate the variation margin, we use Equation 3:
       	​Variation margin = (​ Initial margin × ​Purchase price​t​)​− ​Security price​t​.​

       	​Variation margin = ​(102% × USD98, 042, 620)​− USD103, 000, 000.​

       V
       	​ ariation margin = − USD2, 996, 528.​
       The security price increase to USD103,000,000 resulted in an overcollater-
       alization of the loan by USD2,996,528, allowing the cash borrower (security
       seller) to request the release of five-year US Treasury notes with a face value
       of approximately USD2.91 million (= USD2,996,528/1.03).

    Repo contract participants typically agree to margining and other terms, such as
the substitutability of collateral and events of default, in a master repurchase agree-
ment or similar legal document that governs all trades between parties.


Repurchase Agreement Applications and Benefits
Financial market participants use the repo market for three specific purposes:
   ■    Finance the ownership of a security
   ■    Earn short-term income by lending funds on a secured basis
   ■    Borrow a security in order to sell it short
    Financial institutions that trade securities often or hold securities inventory
frequently participate in the repo market as security sellers or cash borrowers. For
example, say an investor sells a bond to a bank’s trading desk in exchange for cash. The
bank must pay the investor immediately although it may intend to sell the security to
another party at a later time. To do so, the bank may borrow the purchase price from
another bank or an asset manager in exchange for delivering the bond just purchased.
The repo transaction reduces the bank’s funding requirement for the security to a
fraction (equal to the initial margin) of the bond’s purchase price.
    From a security buyer’s perspective, a repo offers a short-term cash investment
on a collateralized basis with minimal liquidity or default risk. Overnight cash repos
with high-quality collateral result in the lowest return; investors can generate higher
returns for longer repo terms or by accepting less liquid or lower quality collateral.

                         These investors include banks and other institutions, such as mutual funds or pension
                         funds. As shown in Exhibit 2, these short-term assets appear on a bank’s balance sheet
                         as “Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell or Borrowed.”
                             Central banks are also active participants in the repo market to conduct monetary
                         policy. While reserve requirements and the outright purchase and sale of securities
                         are more permanent means of influencing the money supply, repo contracts are
                         frequently used for shorter-term, transitory policy measures. For example, a central
                         bank may temporarily increase cash reserves in the banking system by borrowing
                         securities and lending cash.
                             Sometimes, a security buyer enters a repo not only to lend cash for interest but
                         also to use the security for another use. For instance, a hedge fund may take a short
                         position in a security, with a view that its price will decline. The use of a repo trans-
                         action to facilitate this transaction is shown in Exhibit 5.

                             1. The hedge fund borrows the security in exchange for cash in a repo
                                transaction.
                             2. The hedge fund simultaneously sells the security in the secondary market
                                and receives cash.

Repurchase Agreements                                                                        91


       At time t = T:
   3. The hedge fund purchases the security in the secondary market and pays the
      current market price.
   4. The hedge fund simultaneously delivers the security at the pre-agreed repur-
      chase price for cash to settle the repo.
    When viewed from the perspective of the security buyer (cash lender), a repo trans-
action is sometimes referred to as a reverse repurchase agreement or reverse repo.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK


   1. Assume that a hedge fund enters the same repurchase agreement
      from Exhibit 4 as the security buyer (cash lender), sells the security short in
      the secondary market today, and buys back the security to deliver for repo
      settlement in 30 days. For purposes of this example, we exclude initial or
      variation margin.

      Calculate the hedge fund’s return on the transaction if it is able to purchase
      the five-year US Treasury note in 30 days in the secondary market at a price
      equal to 99% of the face value.
      Solution:
      Follow the four steps in Exhibit 5:

      1. The hedge fund borrows the five-year US Treasury note priced at
         USD100,000,000 today and delivers USD100,000,000 in cash to the
         security seller in a repo transaction.
          As in Exhibit 4, the hedge fund (security buyer) agrees to return the
          five-year Treasury note 30 days from today to the seller at a repur-
          chase price of USD100,020,833, calculated (using a 0.25% repo rate) as
          follows:
      USD100,000,000 × [1 + (0.25% × 30)/360] = USD100,020,833.

      2. The hedge fund simultaneously sells the five-year US Treasury note in
         the secondary market today and receives USD100,000,000 in cash.
      3. In 30 days, the hedge fund purchases the five-year US Treasury note in
         the secondary market at the current market price of USD99,000,000.
       4. The hedge fund simultaneously delivers the five-year US Treasury note
            and receives the pre-agreed repurchase price of USD100,020,833 to
            settle the repo.
      The hedge fund has therefore earned a return of USD1,020,833 (=
      USD100,020,833 − USD99,000,000), ignoring transaction costs. The hedge
      fund’s short position yields a profit because the price of the Treasury note
      fell over the time period.

    Ignoring initial margin and other transaction costs, the hedge fund will earn a
positive return if the short position gain exceeds the repo rate for the period. Note that
such a repo transaction requires delivery of a particular security, known as a special
trade, which occurs at a special collateral rate. When a particular security is subject
to very high borrowing demand, this special repo rate may fall below the general
collateral repo rate or even below zero. Under a negative repo rate, the security buyer
pays interest on cash lent to the cash borrower.

                             Repo rates are influenced by several factors, including the following:
                             ■   Money market interest rates: Repo rates are correlated with other short-
                                 term interest rates. Central banks use secured repo markets to influence the
                                 unsecured central bank funds rate.
                             ■   Collateral quality: Higher collateral risk increases repo rates. Repo rates
                                 are usually higher for equity securities or emerging market bonds than for
                                 developed market government bonds.
                             ■   Repo term: Repo rates generally increase with maturity, because long-term
                                 rates exceed short-term rates under normal market conditions and a longer
                                 term increases credit risk.
                             ■   Collateral uniqueness: The higher the demand for a specific security, the
                                 lower the repo rate. The most recently issued or on-the-run developed mar-
                                 ket sovereign bonds typically have the lowest repo rates in a given market.
                             ■   Collateral delivery: Repo rates are usually higher when either the cash lent is
                                 undercollateralized or no collateral is provided to the funds lender.


                         Risks Associated with Repurchase Agreements
                         Repo markets are a widely used source of short-term funding, with relatively low
                         borrowing costs relative to other financing available to banks and other financial
                         institutions. However, repurchase agreements involve a number of structural risks, and
                         excessive reliance on this form of secured financing under adverse market conditions
                         can lead to financial distress or insolvency.
                             Each repo contract participant is exposed to the risk that the other party is unable
                         to meet its obligations. While the secured nature of repo contracts reduces risk due
                         to the value of the underlying collateral, several risks are important to consider:
                             ■   Default risk: Default risk is the primary exposure under a repo transaction,
                                 despite the existence of collateral. Collateral received from less creditworthy
                                 parties is more likely to be tested under a default scenario and may face
                                 illiquidity, adverse price changes, and legal or operational challenges.
                             ■   Collateral risk: In addition to minimizing liquidity and credit risks to ensure
                                 quick and efficient liquidation under a default, the collateral should have
                                 little or no correlation with the credit risk of the repo counterparty in order
                                 to diversify credit exposure.
                             ■   Margining risk: Proper and timely collateral valuation and transfer of vari-
                                 ation margin to minimize collateral shortfalls in the event of liquidation
                                 following a default are important. Such adverse market conditions may also
                                 cause large changes in collateral value, increasing margin calls among mar-
                                 ket participants and forcing further liquidations.
                             ■   Legal risk: Addresses the ability to enforce legal rights under a repurchase
                                 agreement.
                             ■   Netting and settlement risk: Addresses the ability of repo contract partici-
                                 pants to both offset or net the obligations of a non-defaulting party and take
                                 possession of collateral or cash in settlement of a trade.
                             In many cases, repo market participants manage these risks by engaging a third
                         party. Repos executed directly between two parties are called bilateral repos; under a
                         triparty repo, both parties agree to use a third-party agent for the transaction. While
                         triparty agents do not change the credit risk relationship between repo participants
                         in the event of default, they create cost efficiencies by providing access to a larger
                         collateral pool and multiple counterparties, as well as specializing in the valuation

While the repo market represents a more stable funding source than short-term
unsecured financing, both the uncommitted nature of repo markets and their very
short (mostly overnight) maturity give rise to significant rollover and liquidity risks
under adverse market conditions. Financial institutions must balance the low cost of
repo funding with the greater financial flexibility of more costly longer-term financing
alternatives, such as long-term debt and equity. In theory, the collateralized nature
of repo transactions should provide cash lenders comfort to roll existing repo trades.
In practice, financial firms that have lost the confidence of market participants have
faced substantial losses and even bankruptcy during past financial crises due in part
to their heavy reliance on repo financing.

THE FALL OF BEAR STEARNS AND THE REPO MARKET

   Bear Stearns was the fifth-largest US investment bank, with USD350 billion in
   total assets at the end of 2006 and record revenue of over USD9 billion in that
   year. As a major underwriter of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and subprime
   MBS, the firm faced challenges in 2007 as the MBS market deteriorated. The
   firm’s losses mounted due to the failure of subprime mortgage hedge funds it
   had sponsored in July 2007 and the write-down of over USD2 billion in MBS it
   held later in the year, resulting in its first ever quarterly loss and a credit down-
   grade at the end of 2007.
        At the same time, Bear Stearns significantly reduced its unsecured short-
   term funding (from USD25.8 billion at the end of 2006 to USD11.6 billion at the
   end of 2007) and specifically its commercial paper (USD20.7 billion to USD3.9
   billion) in favor of secured funding–specifically, repo borrowing. As of 10 March

                            2008, Bear Stearns had USD18 billion in cash, but within two days, a loss of
                            confidence due to the credit downgrade of related entities and market rumors
                            caused this to fall to USD2 billion. Specifically, repo counterparties declined
                            to roll over or renew repo trades, prime brokerage clients withdrew cash and
                            securities, and other banks withdrew or refused to extend credit. On Friday, 14
                            March 2008, Bear Stearns received an emergency Federal Reserve loan against
                            its securities collateral to prevent its failure, and on Monday, 17 March 2008,
                            Bear Stearns agreed to be purchased by JPMorgan, which received a loan from
                            the Federal Reserve.


                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Assume that today (t = 0) the current US five-year Treasury note
                               trades at a price equal to the bond’s face value of USD100,000,000. The secu-
                               rity buyer takes delivery of the US Treasury note today and pays the security
                               seller a purchase price based on an initial margin of 103%. The repo haircut
                               is closest to:
                                A. 0.00%.
                                B. 2.91%.
                                C. 3.00%.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Using an initial margin of 103%, the purchase price (loan
                               amount) is calculated as USD100,000,000/1.03 = USD97,087,379.
                               The repo haircut is then calculated as
                                (USD100,000,000 − USD97,087,379)/USD100,000,000 = 2.91%.


                            2. Assume that today (t = 0) the current US five-year Treasury note trades at a
                               price equal to the bond’s face value of USD200,000,000. The security buyer
                               takes delivery of the US Treasury note today and pays the security seller a
                               purchase price based on an initial margin of 102%. Assume a repo term of
                               15 days (and 360 days in a year) and an annual interest rate (or repo rate) of
                               0.50%. If the buyer agrees to return the five-year Treasury note 15 days from
                               today (t = T) to the seller, the repurchase price is closest to:
                                A. USD196,119,281.
                                B. USD196,160,130.
                                C. USD200,041,667.
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Using an initial margin of 102%, the purchase price (loan
                               amount) is calculated as USD200,000,000/1.02 = USD196,078,431.
                               The repurchase price is then calculated as follows:
                                USD196,119,281 = USD196,078,431 × [1 + (0.50% × 15)/360].
                               B is incorrect because it incorrectly uses a repo term of 30 days:
                                USD196,160,130 = USD196,078,431 × [1 + (0.50% × 30)/360].
                               C is incorrect because it does not incorporate the initial margin in calculat-
                               ing the purchase price:
                                USD200,041,667 = USD200,000,000 × [1 + (0.50% × 15)/360].

  3. Which of the following statements about repos is correct?
      A. Financial market participants use the repo market to earn short-term
         income by lending funds on a secured basis.
      B. Investors can generate higher returns for shorter repo terms.
      C. From a security buyer’s perspective, a repo offers a short-term cash
         investment on a collateralized basis with significant liquidity or default
         risk.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Financial market participants use the repo market to earn
     short-term income by lending funds on a secured basis. B is incorrect
     because investors can generate higher returns for longer (not shorter) repo
     terms. C is incorrect because from a security buyer’s perspective, a repo
     offers a short-term cash investment on a collateralized basis with minimal
     (not significant) liquidity or default risk.

  4. Which of the following statements about repos is correct?
      A. Repo rates are correlated with other short-term interest rates.
      B. Repo rates are usually lower for equity securities or emerging market
         bonds than for developed market government bonds.
      C. Most recently issued or on-the-run developed market sovereign bonds
         typically have the highest repo rates in a given market.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Repo rates are correlated with other short-term interest rates.
     Central banks use secured repo markets to influence the unsecured central
     bank funds rate. B is incorrect because repo rates are usually higher for eq-
     uity securities or emerging market bonds than for developed market govern-
     ment bonds. C is incorrect because the most recently issued or on-the-run
     developed market sovereign bonds typically have the lowest repo rates in a
     given market.




LONG-TERM CORPORATE DEBT
                                                                                           4
              contrast the long-term funding of investment-grade versus high-yield
              corporate issuers

Earlier lessons on corporate issuers addressed the uses of long-term debt, including
more stable funding for short-term activities and long-term needs, such as capital
investments. While corporate issuers face similar capital allocation and capital struc-
ture decisions when issuing long-term debt regardless of their credit quality, differ-
ences in credit give rise to different features and availability of long-term corporate
funding. Recall that corporate issuers categorized as investment grade (IG) have a
stronger capacity to meet future fixed obligations from cash flows, while the ability
of high-yield (HY) issuers to meet debt interest and principal payments is considered
more vulnerable. The relative credit quality of an issuer grows in importance for longer
maturities as the likelihood of financial distress increases over time.

                         Similarities between Long-Term Investment-Grade and
                         High-Yield Issuance
                         Both issuers and investors considering (non-callable) long-term debt of different
                         maturities weigh the relative risk associated with a maturity choice against its costs
                         or yield-to-maturity. Under normal market conditions, longer maturities are associ-
                         ated with both higher interest rates (yields-to-maturity on government bonds) and
                         higher credit spreads for a given issuer. This is shown in Exhibit 7 by returning to the
                         example of BRWA Corporation.

                         Exhibit 7 shows a partial yield curve for BRWA’s bonds introduced earlier. Say an
                         investor with a five-year investment horizon is instead attracted to the higher YTM
                         of the seven-year BRWA bond. By investing in a bond whose maturity exceeds its
                         planned investment horizon, the investor takes on the price risk of selling what will be
                         a two-year bond in five years’ time. Also note that the investor faces reinvestment risk,
                         or the possibility that prevailing market interest rates at which the investor may invest
                         funds received are lower than the original bond coupon rate. As an issuer, BRWA may,
                         in contrast, be attracted to the lower YTM of a potential three-year issuance to fund a
                         five-year project. However, in doing so, BRWA assumes rollover risk, or the possibility
                         of having to refinance at higher interest rates when these bonds mature in three years.
                         While these trade-offs for both investors and issuers exist for investment-grade and
                         high-yield issuers alike, higher spreads associated with high-yield debt increase the
                         risk-versus-return trade-off for issuers of lower credit quality. The change in a bond’s
                         price for a given change in yield for different maturities and investor returns over a
                         specific horizon will be addressed in detail in later lessons.


                         Differences between IG and HY Issuance
                         The differences between investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds go well
                         beyond simply a difference in credit spreads to compensate investors for assuming more
                         or less default risk. Exhibit 8 summarizes the differences between IG and HY bonds.

Given their strong ability to meet promised interest and principal obligations
from operating cash flows, a significant proportion of the yield-to-maturity on an
investment-grade bond is attributed to the government benchmark yield. High investor
confidence that an IG issuer will be able to make debt service payments over time
from operating cash flows typically allows these borrowers to issue debt with rela-
tively little monitoring from bondholders throughout the debt term. Issuers are able
to take advantage of a high degree of flexibility in choosing debt maturities (usually
up to 30 years), which are accepted by investors with few or no restrictive covenants,
as shown in Exhibit 9.

                            Because BRWA’s senior unsecured notes rely solely on operating cash flows as
                            a source of repayment, the restrictions on these investment-grade bonds are
                            limited to those that broadly protect investor claims to the company’s assets by
                            preventing their sale and leaseback or pledge to a third party.

                             Investment-grade bonds are relatively standardized debt instruments, and issuers
                         often have numerous general obligation unsecured bonds outstanding based on similar
                         terms with different maturities at any given time. The most frequent IG debt issuers
                         often minimize refinancing risk by staggering debt maturities over time, reducing
                         rollover risk while preserving the ability to opportunistically raise more debt if market
                         conditions allow.
                             High-yield issuers are characterized by a higher expected likelihood of financial
                         distress, with a higher proportion of a bond’s YTM attributed to an issuer-specific
                         spread over the benchmark yield than for IG debt. Given the higher chance of default,
                         these instruments are more equity-like in nature (i.e., uncertain cash flows) and analysts
                         place a greater emphasis on the potential loss given default and the protections and
                         secondary repayment sources that are available. As a result, investors generally impose
                         more constraints on high-yield issuers. The debt covenants in a bond’s indenture (or
                         loan covenants in a loan agreement) establish the ability to monitor issuer financial
                         performance based on predetermined criteria, allowing lenders to take actions to
                         restructure debt or preserve creditor claims as needed. Exhibit 10 shows the restrictive
                         covenants for VIVU’s 6.5% seven-year callable bonds.

                            In contrast to BRWA’s IG debtholders, who hold a general obligation unsecured
                            bond and rely on operating cash flows as the source of repayment, as secured deb-
                            tholders, VIVU investors hold a claim to specific pledged assets. This secondary
                            repayment source aims to minimize losses in the more likely event of a default.
                            The indenture also establishes limitations on additional debt and restrictions
                            related to the level of debt versus operating cash flows and the distribution of
                            net income to shareholders.

                             These investor restrictions and constraints result in far less HY issuer flexibility
                         and market availability than for IG issuers. For example, VIVU’s indenture introduced
                         earlier prohibited the company from issuing additional debt under certain conditions
                         unless the new debt is either subordinated or consists of short-term working capital
                         up to 20% of the principal amount of notes outstanding. HY issuers also face limita-
                         tions on debt maturities, which are typically shorter in maturity (10 years or less) and
                         face greater fluctuations in both issuer-specific credit spreads and market availability

over the economic cycle. Instead of financing opportunistically as market conditions
allow, HY firms often must restructure debt and renegotiate covenants in order to
take advantage of lower borrowing costs.
     Issuers in the high-yield market often seek to retain financial flexibility by borrowing
under leveraged loans with prepayment features or issuing bonds with contingency
features. Recall that issuers of callable debt establish the right to redeem all or part of
a bond prior to maturity at a fixed price. In the earlier VIVU example, the company
issued 6.5% debt for seven years but owned the right to redeem bonds starting three
years after issuance at an initial fixed price of 103.25% of principal. Borrowers who
believe their creditworthiness will improve frequently choose to issue callable debt,
because the value of this contingency feature rises as a firm’s borrowing costs fall.
Note that high-yield investors also benefit from higher bond prices (lower yields)
as issuer-specific credit spreads fall, but in the case of callable debt, these gains are
capped at the call price. For example, if VIVU were able to issue new debt in three
years’ time with financing cost savings that exceed the 3.25% call premium in present
value terms, it would make sense for VIVU to call the bonds and issue new debt at
a lower YTM. The relationship between the prices and yields of callable bonds and
the different outcomes for high-yield issuers and investors are covered in detail later
in the curriculum.
     An important exception in the high-yield bond market is formerly investment-grade
issuers known as “fallen angels,” introduced earlier. While these borrowers’ likelihood
of financial distress is similar to that of other high-yield issuers, their outstanding debt
has investment-grade features; that is, it is typically non-callable, with few restric-
tions and covenants and longer maturities. The reason for this is that the bonds were
issued to investment-grade bond investors at a time when the borrower was highly
rated. The subsequent deterioration in issuer credit quality results in losses to the
original investors, many of whom must divest these bonds because they no longer
meet minimum rating requirements for their portfolios. This can result in significant
price deterioration because the market for high-yield bonds is a fraction of the size
of the market for investment-grade bonds.

QUESTION SET


   1. For a given issuer, longer maturities are typically associated with:
       A. lower interest rates and lower credit spreads.
       B. lower interest rates and higher credit spreads.
       C. higher interest rates and higher credit spreads.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Under normal market conditions, longer maturities are asso-
      ciated with both higher interest rates and higher credit spreads for a given
      issuer. A and B are incorrect because longer maturities are typically associ-
      ated with higher interest rates and higher credit spreads.

   2. Which of the following is a reason why a high-yield issuer may elect to issue
      equity as opposed to bonds?
       A. High-yield bond maturities are limited to 30 years or less.
       B. High-yield issuers face numerous restrictions when issuing debt.

                                 C. High-yield bond analysts use financial ratios and credit ratings to
                                    determine when a high-yield issuer’s credit rating is likely to change.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. High-yield issuers face numerous restrictions when issuing
                                debt; however, there are limited restrictions when issuing equity. A is incor-
                                rect because high-yield bond maturities tend to be limited to 10 years (not
                                30 years) or less whereas there is no maturity date on equity. C is incorrect
                                because investment-grade bond analysts use financial ratios and credit
                                ratings to determine when an investment-grade issuer’s credit rating is likely
                                to change.

                             3. Relative to investment-grade bonds, high-yield bonds exhibit:
                                 A. less market availability.
                                 B. more bond-like cash flows.
                                 C. fewer constraints by investors.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Investor restrictions and constraints on HY issuers lead to less
                                market availability than for IG issuers. B is incorrect because high-yield
                                bonds exhibit more equity-like cash flows. C is incorrect because high-yield
                                bonds exhibit more restrictions and constraints by investors.

                             4. Which of the following statements about high-yield bonds relative to invest-
                                ment-grade bonds is correct?
                                 A. High-yield bonds have more bond-like cash flows.
                                 B. Investment-grade bonds have greater issuer restrictions.
                                 C. High-yield bonds have a higher proportion of YTM attributed to a
                                    credit spread.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. High-yield bonds have a higher proportion of YTM attributed
                                to a credit spread, while investment-grade bonds have a lower proportion of
                                YTM attributed to a credit spread. A is incorrect because high-yield bonds
                                have more equity-like cash flows while investment-grade bonds have more
                                bond-like cash flows. B is incorrect because investment-grade bonds have
                                fewer issuer restrictions than high-yield bonds.

                             5. Which of the following statements about fallen angels is correct?
                                 A. Their outstanding debt has high-yield bond features.
                                 B. Their likelihood of financial distress is similar to that of other high-
                                    yield issuers.
                                 C. The improvement in issuer credit quality results in gains to the origi-
                                    nal investors.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Fallen angels’ likelihood of financial distress is similar to that of
                                other high-yield issuers. A is incorrect because their outstanding debt has
                                investment-grade (not high-yield) bond features; they are typically non-call-
                                able, with few restrictions and covenants and longer maturities. C is incor-
                                rect because the deterioration (not improvement) in issuer credit quality
                                results in losses (not gains) to the original investors, many of whom must

                             PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                          1. Which of the following is a benefit to a bank that makes short-term loans and
                             issues asset-backed commercial paper?
                              A. The bank receives commercial paper when the ABCP is issued.

                              B. Capital costs are reduced by providing undrawn backup liquidity instead of
                                 holding the short-term loans to maturity.

                              C. The bank purchases a liquid, short-term note with interest and principal
                                 payments from a short-term loan portfolio to which it would otherwise not
                                 have direct access.

                          2. Ewing Corp. is a large corporation that has an existing relationship with Syc-
                             amore Bank. Ewing is seeking short-term financing from a committed line of
                             credit; however, Sycamore will offer only an uncommitted line of credit. Which
                             of the following best supports Sycamore’s decision?
                              A. Sycamore will receive an upfront commitment fee on the uncommitted line
                                 of credit.

                              B. Sycamore will require less bank capital for the uncommitted line than for
                                 the committed line of credit.

                              C. Sycamore can form a syndicate to reduce the amount of committed capital
                                 needed under an uncommitted line of credit.

                          3. Assume that today (t = 0) the current US five-year Treasury note trades at a price
                             equal to the bond’s face value of USD50,000,000. The security buyer takes deliv-
                             ery of the US Treasury note today and pays the security seller USD50,000,000.
                             Assume a repo term of 45 days (and 360 days in a year) and a repo rate of 0.375%.
                             If the buyer agrees to return the five-year Treasury note 45 days from today (t =
                             T) to the seller, the repurchase price is closest to:
                              A. USD50,015,625.

                              B. USD50,023,438.

                              C. USD50,187,500.

                          4. A transaction where a hedge fund enters into a repo by taking a short position
                             in a security with a view that its price will decline relative to the price of another
                             security held is best described as:
                              A. a reverse repo.

                              B. a triparty repo.

                              C. financing the ownership of a security.

                          5. Which of the following is not a reason why issuers elect to issue long-term debt
                             as opposed to short-term debt?
                              A. More stable funding for short-term activities

                              B. Lower interest rates for longer maturities for a given issuer

6. Which of the following statements about high yield is correct?
   A. High-yield investors benefit from higher bond prices as issuer-specific credit
      spreads fall, but in the case of callable debt, these gains are capped at the
      original purchase price.

      ing under leveraged loans with prepayment features or issuing bonds with
      contingency features.

   C. Issuers who believe that their creditworthiness will decline frequently
      choose to issue callable debt, because the value of this contingency feature
      rises as a firm’s borrowing costs rise.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. The bank will reduce capital costs by providing undrawn back-
                             up liquidity instead of holding the short-term loans to maturity. A is incorrect
                             because the bank receives cash when the ABCP is issued, which increases the
                             bank’s return. C is incorrect because investors purchase a liquid, short-term note
                             with interest and principal payments from a short-term loan portfolio to which it
                             would otherwise not have direct access.

                          2. B is correct. Committed lines require more bank capital than uncommitted lines,
                             although commitments of less than a year (usually 364 days) minimize a bank’s
                             capital requirement. A is incorrect because Sycamore will receive an upfront
                             commitment fee on a committed line of credit. C is incorrect because Sycamore
                             can form a syndicate to reduce the amount of committed capital needed under a
                             committed line of credit.

                          3. B is correct. USD50,023,438 is calculated as:
                              USD50,000,000 × [1 + (0.375% × 45/360)] = USD50,023,438.
                              In effect, the security seller borrows USD50,000,000 on a short-term basis at a
                              low cost, with interest (USD23,438) paid at maturity, because the loan is collater-
                              alized by the US Treasury note.
                              A is incorrect because a repo term of 30 days, as opposed to 45 days, is incorrect-
                              ly used:
                              USD50,000,000 × [1 + (0.375% × 30/360)] = USD50,015,625.
                              C is incorrect because the repo term and number of days in a year are not used:
                              USD50,000,000 × (1 + 0.375%) = USD50,187,500.

                          4. A is correct. When viewed from the perspective of the security buyer (cash
                             lender), a repo transaction is referred to as a reverse repurchase agreement or
                             reverse repo. B is incorrect because under a triparty repo, both parties agree to
                             use a third-party agent for the transaction. C is incorrect because financing the
                             ownership of a security is not the purpose undertaken by the hedge fund.

                          5. B is correct. Under normal market conditions, longer maturities are associated
                             with both higher interest rates (yields-to-maturity on government bonds) and
                             higher credit spreads for a given issuer. A is incorrect because long-term debt
                             provides more stable funding for short-term activities. C is incorrect because
                             long-term debt provides more stable funding for long-term needs, such as capital
                             investments.

                          6. B is correct. Issuers in the high-yield market often seek to retain financial flex-
                             ibility by borrowing under leveraged loans with prepayment features or issuing
                             bonds with contingency features, such as callable debt. A is incorrect because
                             high-yield investors benefit from higher bond prices as issuer-specific credit
                             spreads fall, but in the case of callable debt, these gains are capped at the call
                             price and not the original purchase price. C is incorrect because issuers who
                             believe that their creditworthiness will not decline frequently choose to issue
                             callable debt, because the value of this contingency feature rises as a firm’s bor-
                             rowing costs fall.

INTRODUCTION
In this module, we complete the review of major fixed-income sectors by focusing on
                                                                                            1
public sector issuers, including sovereign and non-sovereign governments, and how
they differ from private sector issuers. Sovereign governments are distinguished by
their right to tax within a jurisdiction, while non-sovereign, quasi-government, and
supranational issuers may rely on local taxes, fee-based revenue, or other sources of
repayment. Sovereign debt issuance is usually conducted through scheduled public
auctions, with a different role for financial intermediaries than in private sector issu-
ance. Sovereign debt securities are the most common benchmark securities used in
pricing and valuation analyses for fixed-income instruments.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   National or sovereign government issuers are distinguished by
           their legal authority to establish and maintain a country’s pub-
           lic goods and services, as well as their ability to tax economic activity
           in their jurisdictions. Developed market sovereign issues are charac-
           terized by a strong, stable, well-diversified domestic economy, and
           emerging market sovereign issuers are usually characterized by higher
           growth but less stable and less well-diversified economies subject to
           greater fluctuations over the economic cycle.

                                 ■   Issuance of sovereign debt usually takes the form of a public auction
                                     using standard procedures led by the national treasury or finance min-
                                     istry, while corporate debt issuances are managed by investment bank
                                     underwriters on behalf of issuers. Sovereign governments designate a
                                     group of financial intermediaries as primary dealers that are required
                                     to participate in all auctions with competitive prices.
                                 ■   Once a government debt auction is announced, prospective investors
                                     submit competitive or non-competitive bids. Once issued, sovereign
                                     debt is usually traded in a manner similar to private sector debt securi-
                                     ties, primarily in OTC markets through financial intermediary broker/
                                     dealers.
                                 ■   The level and type of non-sovereign government funding vary widely
                                     among countries, depending on whether specific goods and services
                                     are provided and financed at the national, regional, or local level.
                                 ■   Agencies are quasi-government entities that issue debt in order to
                                     fund the government-sponsored provision of specific public goods or
                                     services based on sovereign or local law. Supranational organizations
                                     are created and supported by sovereign governments in pursuit of a
                                     common objective.



                           LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                             These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                             of understanding of this learning module.

                             1. Complete the sentence by selecting the correct words from the options
                                given.

                                A nation’s fiscal policy determines the (level/composition) of sovereign debt
                                through central government spending, and government debt management
                                policies address the (level/composition) of sovereign debt—that is, short
                                term versus long term, as well as other features.
                                Solution:
                                A nation’s fiscal policy determines the level of sovereign debt through
                                central government spending, and government debt management policies
                                address the composition of sovereign debt—that is, short term versus long
                                term, as well as other features.

                             2. The issuer ranks bids by prices, choosing bids from highest to lowest until
                                the desired issuance amount is reached, for:
                                A. single-price auctions.
                                B. multiple-price auctions.
                                 C. single-price and multiple-price auctions.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. For both a single-price and a multiple-price auction, the issuer
                                ranks bids by prices, choosing bids from highest to lowest until the desired
                                issuance amount is reached.

Sovereign Debt                                                                               107


  3. Compare the role of financial intermediaries when engaging with sovereign
     issuers versus corporate debt issuers.
     Solution:
     Sovereign issuers engage with financial intermediaries, like corporate debt
     issuers, but in a different form. Sovereign governments designate a group of
     financial intermediaries as primary dealers that are required to participate
     in all auctions with competitive prices, often serve as the central bank’s
     counterparty for open market operations, and facilitate the purchase and
     sale of government debt by foreign central banks and other indirect bidders.
     Corporate debt issuances, in contrast, are managed by investment bank
     underwriters on behalf of issuers.

  4. The ability of _______________________ government issuers to access fund-
     ing across maturities is affected by the predictability and stability of sources
     of repayment.
      A. Sovereign
      B. Non-sovereign
      C. Both sovereign and non-sovereign
     Solution:
     C is correct. Borrowing costs and access to financing for both sovereign and
     non-sovereign government issuers are affected by their credit quality.

  5. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

     Sovereign agencies, such as the Airport Authority of Hong Kong (AAHK)
     and the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), benefit
     from the full liquidity premium associated with sovereign debt.
     Solution:
     False. While each of these sovereign agencies is typically able to borrow at a
     yield-to-maturity near that of their sovereign guarantor, neither will benefit
     from the full liquidity premium associated with sovereign debt.




SOVEREIGN DEBT
                                                                                         2
             describe funding choices by sovereign and non-sovereign
             governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies

National or sovereign government issuers are distinguished by their legal authority
to establish and maintain a country’s public goods and services and their ability to
tax economic activity in their jurisdiction. Additional sources of repayment for their
debt obligations include tariffs, usage fees, and cash flows from government-owned
enterprises. The size and scope of public goods and services provided by national,
versus regional or local, governments vary widely among markets, as does the degree
of government involvement in the economy. Similar to private sector issuers, a gov-
ernment’s “economic balance sheet” may be used to illustrate the sources and uses
of funding, as shown in Exhibit 1, which also includes activities of the central bank.

                          While private issuers prepare and file periodic financial statements in accordance with
                          generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), public sector financial accounting
                          standards vary widely and are often prepared using cash, rather than accrual-based,
                          principles, typically excluding such items as the depreciation of fixed public goods,
                          such as federal highways, or the accrual of unfunded liabilities, such as government
                          pension obligations. In contrast, the economic balance sheet in Exhibit 1 includes
                          expected future claims and obligations and is therefore of greater relevance for public
                          versus private sector issuers.
                              The relative size of the government sector as a proportion of the domestic econ-
                          omy varies widely among nations, and the allocation of these activities between the
                          national government itself, quasi-government agencies, and local governments also
                          differs among countries. As a result, this gives rise to non-sovereign issuers based in
                          the same jurisdiction as the sovereign issuer, a topic discussed in Lesson 3.
                              A key distinction among national government issuers is the difference between
                          developed market and emerging market sovereign issuers.
                              ■   Developed market (DM) sovereign issuers: DMs are characterized by a
                                  strong, stable, well-diversified domestic economy. DM national government
                                  budgets primarily comprise consistent, recurrent outlays financed with
                                  broad-based individual and business tax cash flows, resulting in stable and
                                  transparent fiscal policy. DM fixed-income securities are denominated in a
                                  major currency commonly held in reserve by foreign governments. These
                                  features allow DM sovereign governments to issue what is often referred to
                                  as default-risk-free debt with unconstrained market access across the matu-
                                  rity spectrum.
                              ■   Emerging market (EM) sovereign issuers: EMs are usually characterized by
                                  higher growth but less stable and less well-diversified economies subject
                                  to greater fluctuations over the economic cycle. EMs often depend on a

Sovereign Debt                                                                           109


       dominant domestic industry or industries, such as commodities, and may
       involve more state-owned or state-controlled enterprises. Central govern-
       ment budget priorities may involve investments to expand economic and
       social infrastructure that exceed current domestic tax cash flows, giving
       rise to external or supranational funding. EM sovereign debt securities are
       often denominated in a restricted domestic currency, or one with limited
       convertibility into other currencies due to illiquidity. Currency restrictions
       may limit foreign investment and constrain access to longer-term maturities
       in domestic currency.
    In the case of emerging market sovereign issuers, it is important to further dis-
tinguish between domestic debt issued in the domestic currency and external debt,
or debt owed to foreign creditors. Sovereign bonds issued in domestic currency are
often held mostly by domestic financial institutions and other domestic investors.
    External debt of emerging and frontier market sovereign issuers comprises debt
from supranational financial organizations and debt issuance denominated in a foreign
currency held by foreign private investors. Earlier modules cited examples of emerging
market sovereign Eurobond issuance, such as Romania’s euro-denominated bond and
the quasi-government PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance US dollar–denominated
bond. Investors based in developed markets who purchase these bonds do not face
the same direct currency risk as for domestic currency emerging market sovereign
debt. However, they face indirect exposure to currency fluctuations, because their
returns depend on an issuer’s ability to generate foreign currency revenue through
international capital, goods, and services flows sufficient to meet foreign currency
interest and principal payments. The following example highlights the case of the
government of Sri Lanka’s external debt.

GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA EXTERNAL DEBT

  In May 2022, Sri Lanka became the first Asia-Pacific country in many years
  to default on its external debt when it failed to make USD78 million in for-
  eign currency interest payments following a 30-day grace period. Sri Lanka’s
  government debt rose sharply in the years preceding the default due in large
  part to infrastructure projects financed by global debt markets, supranational
  agencies, and major trading partners. Total government debt outstanding rose
  from 87% of Sri Lanka’s GDP to over 100% in 2020, while both its economy and
  foreign currency reserves shrank during that year due to a collapse in tourism
  and declining remittances from citizens working abroad. Higher inflation and
  commodity prices in the wake of the 2022 war in Ukraine compounded the
  country’s external debt problems and ultimately led to default.

                              A nation’s fiscal policy determines the level of sovereign debt through central
                          government spending, including both budgetary requirements and debt service costs,
                          against tax receipts, fees, and revenue from government-owned enterprises or other
                          sources. Government budget deficits increase the need for borrowing while surpluses
                          reduce borrowing needs. Forecasts of sovereign debt levels must consider not only
                          changes in fiscal policy but also the sensitivity of expenditures and revenues to changes
                          in economic growth and inflation.
                              Government debt management policies address the composition of sovereign
                          debt—that is, short term versus long term, as well as other features. Sovereign debt
                          issues include the following:
                              ■   Short-term securities (with maturities ranging from 1 to 12 months), often
                                  known as Treasury bills, which are usually zero-coupon instruments sold at
                                  a discount to par.
                              ■   Medium- and long-term securities often known as Treasury notes and
                                  bonds. Fixed-rate coupon instruments in the domestic currency are most
                                  common, but sovereigns also issue floating-rate, inflation-linked, and foreign
                                  currency instruments.
                              ■   While not acting as the issuer, some sovereign governments guarantee cer-
                                  tain other instruments that, in effect, make them a type of sovereign debt.
                                  The most prominent example is mortgage-backed securities, especially in
                                  the United States, that conform to certain criteria. Such instruments will be
                                  discussed in detail later.
                              Given the sovereign right to levy taxes on economic activity, national governments
                          represent the lowest default risk among domestic currency issuers and are usually the
                          largest bond issuer in a domestic market.
                              Recall from earlier in the corporate issuers reading that the Modigliani–Miller
                          (MM) theorem stated that under certain strict conditions, a company’s choice of
                          capital structure is irrelevant in determining the present value of the firm’s expected
                          future cash flows. In the case of sovereign government debt, the Ricardian equivalence

Sovereign Debt                                                                              111


theorem introduced in an earlier economics lesson, which was based on similar sim-
plified assumptions, gives an analogous result: a government’s choice of debt maturity
is irrelevant in determining the present value of future tax cash flows.
     Under Ricardian equivalence, taxpayers expect government debt to be offset by
higher future taxes, suggesting that a sovereign government should be indifferent
between collecting taxes today or raising debt of any maturity based on the following
assumptions:
   ■   Taxpayers smooth consumption over time, saving expected future taxes
       today for future payment.
   ■   Taxpayers form rational expectations that today’s tax cuts will result in
       future tax increases.
   ■   Capital markets are perfect with no transaction costs, and taxpayers can
       freely borrow and lend.
   ■   Taxpayers are altruistic on an intergenerational basis; that is, they pass on
       tax savings to descendants.
    The relaxation of these Ricardian equivalence assumptions to allow imperfect
capital markets and friction costs between bond investors and taxpayers gives rise to
debt management policies that offer liquidity benefits to investors and other issuers
across the maturity spectrum.
    For example, short-term government issuance provides investors with a high
degree of liquidity and safety and often substitutes for bank deposits. Under normal
market conditions, the prices of these very short-term government securities involve
a liquidity premium; that is, their yields-to-maturity will tend to be lower than they
otherwise would be in the absence of this liquidity benefit. While short-term sovereign
debt is typically issued at regular intervals (discussed later) and standard maturities,
government issuers have a high degree of flexibility to alter the size of these periodic
auctions to manage uncertain cash flows, such as near-term tax receipts or unforeseen
funding needs.
    Strict adherence to Ricardian equivalence assumptions suggests that governments
should fund themselves with the shortest possible maturity to minimize borrowing
costs and avoid paying any term premium associated with longer-term interest rates.
However, similar to the example of corporate bonds in the prior module, excessive
government reliance on short-term funding introduces rollover risk, or uncertain
refinancing costs, increasing the variability of budget costs and therefore tax rates.
Since taxpayers are unable to perfectly smooth consumption over time nor do they
form rational expectations about current versus future taxes across generations,
fiscal instability creates uncertainty in future tax rates and threatens the stability of
economic growth over time. Therefore, in practice, governments seek to minimize
interest rate and rollover risks by distributing debt across maturities, while issuing
debt in regular, predictable intervals.
Fiscal policies differ significantly across the 38 OECD member countries, but their
sovereign debt maturity structures have shown far less variance. At the end of 2021,
the weighted average maturity across the OECD was just over one year higher than
the average at the end of 2007. Long-term debt represented 85% of total sovereign
debt outstanding, largely unchanged since 2007, while annual issuance was evenly
split between short and long term (short-term debt must be issued more frequently
because it matures sooner). This time frame includes two major recessions and sig-
nificant sovereign debt issuance.

                              The use of medium- and long-term sovereign funding issuance must balance the
                          trade-off of higher borrowing costs with greater fiscal stability, while considering
                          liquidity or other benefits of issuing bonds with the lowest default risk across the
                          maturity spectrum.
                              The benefits of issuing sufficient longer-term sovereign government securities to
                          maintain liquidity across maturities include the following:
                              ■      Establishment of a risk-free benchmark for all debt of specific maturities: The
                                     first fixed-income module demonstrated the use of sovereign bond yields to
                                     calculate an issuer’s credit risk premium. Government debt policies often
                                     mandate the regular issuance of benchmark securities across maturities to
                                     increase capital market efficiency and transparency for private issuers.

   ■    Preferred use as collateral in repo and derivative transactions: Longer-term
        government securities are the most common form of collateral for both repo
        and derivative transactions due to their high degree of liquidity and safety.
        Recall from the prior learning module that repurchase agreements offer
        security sellers a means of financing and offer security buyers a short-term
        collateralized investment with relatively little liquidity or default risk.
   ■    Government bond use in monetary policy and foreign exchange reserves:
        Recall from an earlier lesson that central banks use government securities
        in fulfilling their monetary policy mandate, which includes the outright
        purchase and sale of securities and repo contracts with government bonds
        as collateral. Given their high degree of liquidity and safety, foreign market
        participants often hold their foreign currency reserves in the form of liquid
        foreign government bonds.
   While sovereign governments seek to maintain regular and predictable bond
market access across maturities, changes in the amount of debt, the level of deficits,
and the difference between short- and long-term interest rates lead to changes in debt
management policy, as shown in the following example.

THE US TREASURY’S 30-YEAR BOND

  In October 2001, the United States stopped issuing 30-year Treasury bonds due
  to cost concerns related to paying interest on the notes. At the time, Treasury
  officials saw a reduced need for future borrowing because the U government
  was posting a budget surplus. The move stunned the markets and resulted in the
  largest one-day price move in years due to supply concerns. In prior years, the
  Treasury Department suspended the three- and seven-year issues. The 10-year
  Treasury became the de facto benchmark for measuring the performance of
  long-term bonds during the suspension of the 30-year bond. Issuance of the
  30-year US Treasury bond resumed in February 2006 to cover deficits created
  by tax cuts and war spending.

QUESTION SET


  1. Identify the following statement as true or false. Justify your answer.

       Emerging market external sovereign debt is denominated in a foreign
       currency.
       Solution:
       False. Although EM sovereigns do issue debt in foreign currencies to
       increase demand by foreign investors who desire less currency risk, many
       EM sovereigns have external debt denominated in their domestic currency
       as well, especially those with currencies that have exhibited exchange rate
       stability.

                             2. US-based investors of US dollar–denominated external sovereign debt can
                                still face exposure to currency risk because:
                                A. sovereign fixed-income securities are denominated in freely floating
                                   domestic currencies.
                                B. the issuer’s credit rating may be downgraded.
                                 C. the issuer must be able to generate foreign currency revenue.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Investors based in developed markets who purchase external
                                debt of emerging and frontier market sovereign issuers face indirect expo-
                                sure to currency fluctuations, because their returns depend on an issuer’s
                                ability to generate foreign currency revenue to meet foreign currency
                                interest and principal payments through international capital, goods, and
                                services flows.

                             3. Explain why national governments represent the lowest default risk among
                                domestic currency issuers.
                                Solution:
                                National governments are distinguished by their sovereign right to generate
                                tax cash flows from economic activity within a jurisdiction, unlike private
                                sector issuers that rely on operating cash flows and secondary sources of
                                repayment, such as asset sales, to service debt obligations.

                             4. Due to their high degree of liquidity and safety, the most common form of
                                collateral for both repo and derivative transactions is:
                                A. shorter-term government securities.
                                B. medium-term government securities.
                                 C. longer-term government securities.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Longer-term government securities are the most common
                                form of collateral for both repo and derivative transactions due to their high
                                degree of liquidity and safety.

                             5. A sovereign government faced with growing deficits and concerns about
                                rollover risk would most likely:
                                A. lower tax rates.
                                B. stop servicing the debt.
                                 C. issue medium- to long-term securities.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Government budget deficits increase the need for borrowing
                                at a higher level while surpluses reduce borrowing needs. Excessive govern-
                                ment reliance on short-term funding introduces rollover risk, or uncertain
                                refinancing costs, increasing the variability of budget costs and therefore
                                tax rates. Therefore, in practice, governments seek to minimize interest
                                rate and rollover risks by distributing debt across maturities while issuing
                                debt in regular, predictable intervals. A is incorrect because taxes should be
                                raised, not lowered, in such a scenario. B is incorrect because such an action
                                would put the government in default, with severe consequences for its credit

Sovereign Debt Issuance and Trading                                                            115



SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUANCE AND TRADING
                                                                                           3
              contrast the issuance and trading of government and corporate
              fixed-income instruments

In contrast to the opportunistic nature of corporate debt issuance managed by invest-
ment bank underwriters on behalf of issuers, issuance of sovereign debt usually takes
the form of a public auction led by the national Treasury or finance ministry.
    Once a government debt auction is announced, prospective investors submit
competitive or non-competitive bids. A competitive bidder specifies an acceptable
price and number of securities to be purchased. If the price determined at auction is
above the bid, a competitive bidder will not be offered any securities. In contrast, a
non-competitive bidder agrees to accept the price determined at auction and always
receives securities.
    A competitive bid process is either a single-price auction or multiple-price
auction. In both cases, the issuer ranks bids by prices, choosing bids from highest to
lowest until the desired issuance amount is reached. Under a single-price auction, all
winning bidders pay the same price and receive the same coupon rate for the bonds
regardless of their bid. In contrast, a multiple-price auction process generates differ-
ent prices among bidders for the same bond issue. The single-price auction process
may result in a lower cost of funds and broader distribution among investors, while
multiple-price auctions may result in a narrower distribution of large bids because
investors must accept bonds at their bid price.
    A single-price auction process has four phases:
   1. The auction is announced by the government debt management office,
      which includes information about the bond issue, such as the amount and
      type of securities being offered, the auction and issue dates, the maturity
      date of the bonds, and bidding times.
   2. Dealers, institutional investors, and individuals make bids. Bids can be com-
      petitive or non-competitive.
   3. All non-competitive bids are accepted while competitive bids are ranked
      starting at the lowest yield (highest bond price). The highest yield that fills
      the offering amount, counting from the bottom, is the “cut off.” All securities
      are sold for a single price, using this stop yield. Competitive bidders who bid
      higher than this yield (lower price) do not purchase any securities. Results
      are announced publicly, as shown in Exhibit 2.
   4. Securities are delivered to the non-competitive and winning competitive
      bidders in exchange for proceeds.

                           GOVERNMENT OF INDIA SWITCHES FROM MULTIPLE-PRICE TO SINGLE-PRICE
                           DEBT AUCTIONS

                             In July 2021, the central bank of India (Reserve Bank of India) moved from mul-
                             tiple- to single-price auctions for its 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, 14-year, and
                             floating-rate bonds. The 30-year and 40-year bonds continued to be auctioned
                             via the multiple-price method. The Reserve Bank of India changed the method-
                             ology it uses for government bond issuance after it faced several partially failed
                             auctions. Under the single-price auction, volatility in yields is reduced because
                             all successful bidders receive the same rate.

Sovereign Debt Issuance and Trading                                                                117


     Sovereign issuers also engage with financial intermediaries, such as corporate
debt issuers, but in a different form. Sovereign governments designate a group of
financial intermediaries as primary dealers that are required to participate in all
auctions with competitive prices, often serve as the central bank’s counterparty for
open market operations and facilitate the purchase and sale of government debt by
foreign central banks and other indirect bidders. Investors may also participate directly
in auctions—for example, through the UK Debt Management Office or TreasuryDirect
in the United States.
     Once issued, sovereign debt is usually traded in a manner similar to that of private
sector debt securities primarily on OTC markets by financial intermediary broker/
dealers, although in some markets, such as Australia, they are traded on an exchange.
In each market, the sovereign issuer is often the largest borrower and their securities
are the most liquid among fixed-income instruments. The most recently issued sov-
ereign debt securities, known as on-the-run securities, are used for benchmark yield
analyses because they are more liquid than previously issued off-the-run securities,
which trade infrequently. Given their liquidity, some trading of on-the-run securities
occurs electronically, on centralized marketplaces operated by private companies.
     A significant difference in trading between sovereign and corporate debt is the
presence of investors in sovereign debt with varying “non-economic” objectives. For
example, major investors in US Treasuries include the Federal Reserve, which uses
Treasuries in the conduct of monetary policy; major foreign governments, which hold
the securities as US dollar reserves; state and local governments, which face restrictions
on holding other types of securities; and banks and insurance companies that either
must hold Treasuries or are incentivized to do so to meet regulatory requirements.
These factors reduce sovereign borrowing costs versus the private sector and are most
pronounced for sovereign issuers with a reserve currency, a currency held by global
central banks in significant quantities and widely used to conduct international trade
and financial transactions. In addition to the US dollar, the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, and Chinese renminbi are reserve currencies.
However, the US dollar accounts for 60% of global foreign exchange reserves and
about half of international trade, international loans, and global debt securities and
is involved in nearly 90% of all FX market transaction.1

QUESTION SET


   1. An advantage of a single-price auction versus a multiple-price auc-
      tion is that a single-price auction may result in a:
       A. lower cost of funds and broader distribution among investors.
       B. narrower distribution of large bids because investors must accept
          bonds at their bid prices.
       C. ranking of bids by prices, where bids from highest to lowest are chosen
          until the desired issuance amount is reached.
      Solution:
      A is correct. The single-price auction process may result in a lower cost of
      funds and broader distribution among investors. B is incorrect because mul-
      tiple-price auctions may result in a narrower distribution of large bids be-
      cause investors must accept bonds at their bid price. C is incorrect because
      in both cases, the issuer ranks bids by prices, choosing bids from highest to
      lowest until the desired issuance amount is reached.

                             2. Discuss how the type of auction (single price or multiple price) can impact
                                the success of auctions and yield volatility.
                                Solution:
                                A multiple-price auction process generates different prices among bidders
                                for the same bond issue. Under a single-price auction, volatility in yields is
                                reduced because all successful bidders receive the same rate. The Reserve
                                Bank of India changed the methodology it uses (from multiple price to sin-
                                gle price) for government bond issuance after it faced a number of partially
                                failed auctions.

                             3. A significant difference in trading between sovereign and corporate debt is:
                                A. the presence of investors in sovereign debt with varying “non-eco-
                                   nomic” objectives.
                                B. the opportunistic nature of sovereign debt issuance managed by
                                   investment bank underwriters on behalf of issuers.
                                 C. that sovereign debt is usually traded on an exchange while private sec-
                                    tor debt primarily trades on OTC markets mediated by broker/dealers.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. A significant difference in trading between sovereign and
                                corporate debt is the presence of investors in sovereign debt with varying
                                “non-economic” objectives. For example, major investors in US Treasur-
                                ies include the Federal Reserve, which uses Treasuries in the conduct of
                                monetary policy; major foreign governments, which hold the securities as
                                US dollar reserves; state and local governments, which face restrictions on
                                holding other types of securities; and banks and insurance companies that
                                either must hold Treasuries or are incentivized to do so to meet regulatory
                                requirements. B is incorrect because in contrast to the opportunistic nature
                                of corporate debt issuance managed by investment bank underwriters on
                                behalf of issuers, sovereign auctions use standard procedures to ensure
                                broad distribution among investors under a transparent price discovery
                                process. C is incorrect because once issued, sovereign debt is usually traded
                                in a manner similar to that of private sector debt securities: primarily on
                                OTC markets mediated by broker/dealers, although in some markets, such

                                        governments, quasi-government entities, and supranational agencies

                          The level and type of non-sovereign government funding vary widely among countries,
                          depending on whether specific public goods and services are provided and financed
                          at the national, regional, or local level. Some non-sovereign government issuers are
                          similar to sovereign borrowers in that they can levy taxes to fund activities in their
                          jurisdiction. Other non-sovereign issuers rely on national government budget alloca-
                          tions or user fees to meet interest and principal payments with or without the explicit

financial support of a national or local government as a secondary repayment source.
The ability of non-sovereign issuers to access funding across maturities is affected by
the predictability and stability of these sources of repayment, which are key determi-
nants of the issuer’s credit quality.


Government Agencies
Government agencies are quasi-government entities that issue debt in order to fund
the government-sponsored provision of specific public goods or services based on
sovereign or local law. This may involve the financing of specific activities promoted
by the government or the operation of necessary infrastructure as mandated by
law. For example, the Airport Authority of Hong Kong (AAHK), introduced in an
earlier module, is the statutory agency for operating and developing the Hong Kong
International Airport. AAHK issues a combination of short- and long-term debt to
meet the airport’s specific working capital and capital investment needs. The primary
source of repayment is cash flows from airport operations, while its sovereign gov-
ernment backing is a secondary source of repayment.
    The Government National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae, not to be
confused with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) securitizes and guarantees certain mort-
gage loans in the United States to subsidize and promote home ownership. Ginnie
Mae issues callable agency debt securities to finance its operations with maturities
matching the expected cash flows of its guaranteed mortgages. The primary source
of repayment for the agency’s debt are mortgage-based guaranty fees and other cash
flows with its sovereign government backing as a secondary source of repayment.
    Both AAHK and Ginnie Mae issue debt with maturities and structures consistent
with their respective underlying activities. That said, while each of these sovereign
agencies is typically able to borrow at a yield-to-maturity near that of their sovereign
guarantor, neither will benefit from the full liquidity premium associated with sover-
eign debt outlined in the prior lesson.


Local and Regional Government Authorities
Non-sovereign government authorities may either issue debt for general purposes,
which is repaid from local tax cash flows, or issue debt to fund specific projects or
infrastructure, which is repaid from user fees or other cash flows directly derived from
the project. The former are referred to as general obligation bonds (GO bonds), which
are used to fund public goods and services in the non-sovereign’s limited jurisdiction,
such as the Province of Ontario green bond issue described in the term sheet below.
These unsecured bonds are repaid with tax revenues from the provincial government,
though their use of proceeds is limited to eligible green projects.

                          Features:                recorded in a designated account in the Province of Ontario’s
                                                   financial records. This designated account will be used to track
                                                   the use of and allocation of proceeds to “Eligible Projects,” which
                                                   include projects in the following sectors:
                                                   1. Clean transportation
                                                   2. Energy efficiency and conservation
                                                   3. Clean energy and technology
                                                   4. Forestry, agriculture, and land management
                                                   5. Climate adaptation and resilience

                          Revenue bonds, in contrast, are issued for specific project financing (infrastructure
                          such as roads, bridges, or tunnels) with the source of repayment often linked to a
                          project’s revenue stream (tolls, fees, etc.). Revenue bonds usually involve longer-dated
                          funding, the maturity of which often matches the expected life of matching project
                          cash flows.


                          Supranational Organizations
                          Supranational organizations, such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund
                          (IMF), and Asian Development Bank (ADB), are created and supported by sovereign
                          governments as member states in pursuit of a common objective, such as fostering
                          economic cooperation and development, promoting trade, or providing financing to
                          emerging economies in pursuit of sustainable growth. Member states typically share
                          decision-making authority and provide implicit and explicit financial support to these
                          organizations, resulting in the highest credit quality among these issuers and a strong
                          ability to access capital markets across maturities. In other cases, supranational and
                          sovereign organizations partner to form quasi-government agencies that can issue
                          debt at a lower cost than an emerging market sovereign government. For example,
                          PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF) was introduced in an earlier lesson as a US
                          dollar–denominated issuer in the Eurobond market. IIF’s ability to access this and
                          similar markets is derived from indirect Indonesian government ownership and the
                          strong financial support from a consortium of public sector entities, including the
                          Asian Development Bank, the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation
                          (IFC), and the German sovereign government development bank (Kreditanstalt für
                          Wiederaufbau, or KfW).
                              Supranational issuers target bond investors in major currencies using global bond
                          markets. In the example bond issue below, the Asian Development Bank borrowed in
                          Indonesian rupiah (IDR) but will pay interest and principal to investors in US dollars.
                          The amounts are fixed in Indonesian rupiah, with the payments in US dollars deter-
                          mined using the spot USD/IDR rate two days prior to each payment date, so investors
                          are still assuming currency risk.

QUESTION SET


   1. Which of the following features is typical of revenue bonds? Reve-
      nue bonds typically:
       A. provide shorter-dated funding.
       B. fund general local government spending.
       C. have maturities matching the expected life of matching project cash
          flows.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Revenue bonds usually involve longer-dated funding, the matu-
      rity of which often matches the expected life of matching project cash flows.
      A is incorrect because revenue bonds usually involve longer-dated funding.
      B is incorrect because revenue bonds fund specific projects while general
      obligation bonds fund local governments generally.

   2. The Asian Development Bank is an example of a:
       A. government agency.
       B. non-sovereign government.
       C. supranational organization.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Supranational organizations, such as the World Bank, IMF, and
      ADB, are created by several sovereign governments in pursuit of a com-
      mon objective, such as fostering economic cooperation and development,
      promoting trade, or providing financing to emerging economies in pursuit
      of sustainable growth. A is incorrect because government agencies are
      subunits of governments formed to carry out specific laws or objectives. B is
      incorrect because non-sovereign governments preside over subdivisions of
      countries (e.g., the province of Ontario in Canada) through constitutional or
      legislative authority.

   3. Member states of a supranational organization typically share decision-mak-
      ing authority and provide implicit and explicit financial support to the orga-
      nization, resulting in which of the following levels of credit quality among
      these issuers?
       A. Lowest

                                 C. Highest
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Member states typically share decision-making authority and
                                provide implicit and explicit financial support to these organizations, result-
                                ing in the highest credit quality among these issuers and a strong ability to
                                access capital markets across maturities.

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1. Balance sheets of government entities are unlikely to include:
   A. FX reserves.

   B. long-term debt.

   C. accrual of unfunded liabilities.

2. In practice, which of the following applies as it relates to sovereign government
   financing?
   A. Taxpayers smooth consumption over time, saving expected future taxes
      today for future payment.

   B. Taxpayers form rational expectations that today’s tax cuts will result in
      future tax increases and pass on tax savings to descendants.

   C. Governments seek to minimize interest rate and rollover risks by distribut-
      ing debt across maturities while issuing debt in regular, predictable intervals.

3. Which of the following is correct regarding the single-price auction process?
   A. Bidders include only dealers and institutional investors.

   B. Competitive bidders who bid higher than the stop yield are allocated

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. C is correct. Public sector financial accounting standards vary widely and are of-
                             ten prepared using cash, rather than accrual-based, principles, typically excluding
                             such items as the depreciation of fixed public goods, such as federal highways,
                             or the accrual of unfunded liabilities, such as government pension obligations.
                             A and B are incorrect because balance sheets of government entities are likely to
                             include FX reserves and long-term debt.

                          2. C is correct. Governments seek to minimize interest rate and rollover risks by
                             distributing debt across maturities while issuing debt in regular, predictable
                             intervals. A and B are incorrect because taxpayers are neither able to perfectly
                             smooth consumption over time, nor do they form rational expectations about
                             current versus future taxes across generations, leading to fiscal instability, cre-
                             ating uncertainty in future tax rates, and threatening the stability of economic
                             growth over time.

                          3. C is correct. All non-competitive bids are accepted, while competitive bids are
                             ranked starting at the lowest yield (highest bond price). A is incorrect because
                             individuals can also bid, in addition to dealers and institutional investors. B is
                             incorrect because competitive bidders who bid higher than the stop yield (lower
                             price) do not purchase any securities. All securities are sold for a single price,
                             using a stop yield.

                          4. A is correct. The most recently issued sovereign securities, known as on-the-run
                             securities, are used for benchmark yield analyses. B is incorrect because
                             off-the-run securities are issued prior to on-the-run securities. C is incorrect
                             because on-the-run securities are not less liquid than off-the-run securities.

                          5. A is correct. General obligation bonds are used to fund public goods and ser-
                             vices in the non-sovereign’s limited jurisdiction and are repaid from local tax
                             cash flows. B is incorrect because revenue bonds are issued for a specific project
                             financing (infrastructure such as roads, bridges, or tunnels) with the source of
                             repayment often linked to a project’s revenue stream (tolls, fees, etc.). C is incor-
                             rect because government agencies are quasi-government entities that issue debt
                             in order to fund the government-sponsored provision of specific public goods or
                             services based on sovereign or local law, with the primary source of repayment
                             related to the public good or service and the sovereign government backing as a
                             secondary source of repayment.

                          6. B is correct. For the Airport Authority of Hong Kong, for example, the primary
                             source of repayment is cash flows from airport operations, while its sovereign
                             government backing is a secondary source of repayment. Similarly, the primary
                             source of repayment for Ginnie Mae is mortgage-based guaranty fees and other
                             cash flows, with its sovereign government backing as a secondary source of
                             repayment. A is incorrect because while sovereign agencies typically borrow at a
                             yield-to-maturity near that of their sovereign guarantor, they do not benefit from
                             the full liquidity premium associated with sovereign debt. C is incorrect because
                             agencies issue a combination of short- and long-term debt to meet specific work-
                             ing capital and capital investment needs.

  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              calculate a bond’s price given a yield-to-maturity on or between
              coupon dates
              identify the relationships among a bond’s price, coupon rate,
              maturity, and yield-to-maturity
              describe matrix pricing




INTRODUCTION
We will now use discounted cash flow analysis to calculate bond prices and show
                                                                                          1
how the discount rate used as well as a bond’s features, such as its coupon rate and
time-to-maturity, affect pricing. The price of a bond and its future cash flows can be
used calculate an internal rate of return, known as the yield-to-maturity, which serves
as a useful return measure for fixed-income investors under certain assumptions. One
of these assumptions that applies to this learning module is that all bond interest and
principal cash flows occur as promised. We will explore the relationship between
bond prices and bond features, showing how different features affect a bond’s price,
and demonstrate pricing both on and between bond coupon dates. Finally, we will
introduce matrix pricing, which uses comparable bonds to estimate a bond’s price
and yield-to-maturity when neither is known.
    Most of the examples and exhibits used throughout the reading can be downloaded
as a Microsoft Excel workbook. Each worksheet in the workbook is labeled with the
corresponding example or exhibit number in the text.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Bond pricing is an application of discounted cash flow analysis.
          Bond prices are a function of a bond’s features, including its
          cash flows and the interest rate(s) used to discount future cash flows.
      ■   By comparing a bond’s price to its face value or its coupon rate to the
          discount rate, we can identify whether a bond is trading at a discount,
          at par, or at a premium.

126   Learning Module 6                                          Fixed-Income Bond Valuation: Prices and Yields


                                 ■   If the market price of a bond is known, an internal rate of return
                                     on the cash flows can be calculated, known as the yield-to-maturity
                                     (YTM). The YTM is the single interest rate that equates the present
                                     value of future cash flows to the price of the bond.
                                 ■   A bond investor’s rate of return will equal the YTM if (1) the investor
                                     holds the bond to maturity, (2) the issuer makes full coupon and prin-
                                     cipal payments on the scheduled dates, and (3) the investor reinvests
                                     all coupon payments at the same YTM.
                                 ■   When a bond is priced or traded in between coupon dates, an addi-
                                     tional amount must be added for interest that has accrued since the
                                     last coupon payment, to compensate the seller, since the buyer will
                                     receive the entire next coupon payment.
                                 ■   To calculate a bond’s accrued interest on any date, we multiply the
                                     coupon by the fraction of days elapsed in the coupon period divided
                                     by the total days in the coupon period. There are various conventions
                                     for counting these days; two common conventions are actual/actual
                                     and 30/360.
                                 ■   A bond’s price changes inversely with changes in its YTM. A bond’s
                                     features determine price sensitivity to changes in YTM.
                                 ■   The lower the coupon rate on a fixed-coupon bond, the greater the
                                     percentage price change for a given change in the bond’s yield-to-ma-
                                     turity. Generally, the longer a bond’s time-to-maturity, the greater its
                                     percentage price change for a given change in its yield-to-maturity.
                                 ■   Unlike listed equity securities, most bonds are thinly traded, which
                                     complicates price discovery.
                                 ■   Matrix pricing is a price estimation process for new or illiquid bonds
                                     that uses yields on securities with the same or similar features. Matrix
                                     pricing is widely used in price quotations for bonds.

                             1. A corporate bond that matures on 1 January 2035 pays semiannual coupons
                                of 3.25% per year and has a face value of 100. The market discount rate is
                                4.0%. For a trade settlement date of 1 January 2030, the price of the bond as
                                a percentage of par value, assuming a 30/360 day count, is closest to:

  2. Which of the following is not required for a bond investor’s rate of return on
     a bond investment to equal the bond’s YTM?
      A. The bond is held to maturity.
      B. The issuer may default on one, but only one, coupon payment.
      C. Coupon payments are reinvested at the same rate as the YTM.
     Solution:
     B is correct. For a bond investor to earn the YTM, the issuer must make all
     coupon and principal payments on their scheduled dates.
     A is incorrect because a bond investor does have to hold the bond to matu-
     rity to earn the YTM.
     C is incorrect because a bond investor does have to reinvest coupons at the
     same rate as the YTM to earn the YTM.

                                of 29 August 2031, the flat price of the bond as a percentage of par value,
                                assuming an actual/actual day count, is closest to:
                                 A. 99.343.

                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The flat price is the full price less accrued interest. The full
                                price is the present value as of the trade settlement date, which involves
                                partial payment periods because we’re between coupon dates.

      B. False
     Solution:
     False. A bond is quoted by its flat price. The full price is the amount paid by
     the buyer to the seller, and it includes accrued interest if settlement does not
     occur on a coupon payment date.

  5. Assume that the Japanese government issues two non-callable fixed-coupon
     bonds on the same date with the same coupon rate. The bonds are identical
     except that one matures in 10 years and the other matures in 30 years. If the
     relevant market discount rates for both bonds rise by 65 bps, which of the
     following will be true?
      A. The 10-year bond will have a larger percentage price change than the
         30-year bond.
      B. The 10-year bond will have a smaller percentage price change than the
         30-year bond.
      C. The 10-year bond and the 30-year bond will have equal percentage
         price changes.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Generally, for the same coupon rate, a shorter-term bond will
     have a smaller percentage price change than a longer-term bond when their
     relevant market discount rates change by the same amount.
     A is incorrect because generally a shorter-term bond will have a smaller per-
     centage price change than a longer-term bond when their market discount
     rates change by the same amount.
     C is incorrect because shorter-term bonds and longer-term bonds will not
     have the same percentage price changes when their market discount rates
     change by the same amount.

  6. True or false. Justify your answer.

     Matrix pricing is an estimation process in which quotes from derivative
     markets (e.g., interest rates swaps) are used to determine the price of illiquid
     or new bonds for which transactional data are scarce.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     False. Matrix pricing is a process for estimating prices of illiquid or newly
     issued bonds using prices of comparable bonds, not from transactions in
     derivative markets. The comparable bonds have similar times-to-maturity,
     coupon rates, and credit quality as those of the bond under study.

                                  Bond Pricing with a Market Discount Rate
                                  Bond pricing is an application of discounted cash flow analysis that depends on a
                                  bond’s cash flow features and the rate (or rates) used for discounting. Recall from
                                  an earlier lesson that the price of the bond at issuance is the present value of the
                                  promised interest and principal cash flows. The market discount rate is used in the
                                  time-value-of-money calculation to obtain the present value. The market discount
                                  rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the bond investment.
                                  It is also called the required yield, or the required rate of return.
                                       The present value (PV) calculation for each bond coupon cash flow (PMT) that
                                  occurs in t periods with a market discount rate of r per period should be familiar from
                                  an earlier time-value-of-money lesson:
                                        PV(Bond coupon) = PMTt/(1 + r)t.                                                             (1)
                                      Equation 2 extends this calculation in a general formula for calculating a bond
                                  price (PV) given the market discount rate on a coupon date:
                                        PV = PMT1/(1 + r)1 + PMT2/(1 + r)2 + … + (PMTN + FVN)/(1 + r)N,                              (2)
                                      where FV is equal to the bond’s face value and N is the number of periods to
                                  maturity.
                                      Recall the Bright Wheels Automotive (BRWA) bond introduced in an earlier
                                  lesson. The bond’s price was 100% of face or par value because the market discount
                                  rate, r, and the bond’s fixed coupon rate, PMT, were equal (at 3.2% per annum, or
                                  1.6% semiannually). We will now consider cases where the bond’s coupon rate and
                                  the market discount rate are not equal.

                                     If the market discount rate rises to 2% semiannually, new bonds to be issued at
                                     par must provide coupon rates that are also 2% semiannually. The previously
                                     issued BRWA bond pays coupons at a 1.6% rate, so it should have a lower price
                                     than a bond that pays 2%. We could say that the BRWA bond’s 1.6% coupon rate
                                     is deficient relative to the higher 2% market discount rate. The market price of
                                     the BRWA bond, with its lower coupon, will therefore fall below 100% of par.
                                     Example 1 shows that when we discount the BRWA bond cash flows at a market
                                     discount rate of 2%, we calculate a price of 96.41. This lower price compensates
                                     for a coupon rate below the market discount rate. When a bond’s price is less

  than 100, we say that the bond trades at a discount. (This use of “discount” when
  referring to the bond price is not connected to the use of “discount” in market
  discount rates). Exhibit 1 illustrates a bond trading at a discount.

      We now consider how the price of the existing BRWA bond will change if the
  market discount rate falls to 1.2%. A similar bond (five-year maturity, semi-annual
  coupon) issued when the five-year market discount rate is 1.2% semiannually
  will also have a semi-annual coupon rate of 1.2% so that its price will be 100% of
  par. Because the BRWA bond pays a higher coupon rate of 1.6%, its price should
  be higher than that of a bond that pays only 1.2%. We could say that the BRWA
  bond’s 1.6% coupon rate is excessive relative to the lower 1.2% market discount
  rate. Therefore, the BRWA bond’s price rises as the market discount rate falls.
  When we discount the cash flows of the BRWA bond at the market discount
  rate of 1.2% and then add them up, we calculate a bond price equal to 103.73%
  of par. It has a higher price than the 1.2% coupon bond because it pays a higher
  coupon. Exhibit 2 illustrates a bond trading at a premium.

                                 The interest rates per period are annualized by multiplying the rate per period
                             by the number of periods in a year. Therefore, an equivalent statement is that
                             the BRWA bond is priced at a premium because its stated annual coupon rate
                             of 3.2% is greater than the stated annual market discount rate of 2.4%. Unless
                             stated otherwise, interest rates are typically quoted as annual rates.



                          Yield-to-Maturity
                          If the market price of a bond is known, Equation 2 can be used to calculate its
                          yield-to-maturity. The yield-to-maturity is the internal rate of return on the cash
                          flows—the uniform interest rate such that when the future cash flows are discounted
                          at that rate, the sum of the present values equals the price of the bond. It is an implied
                          or observed single market discount rate.
                              A bond investor will earn a rate of return on a bond equal to its YTM if each of
                          the following is true:
                              1. The investor holds the bond to maturity.
                              2. The issuer makes full coupon and principal payments on scheduled dates.
                                 The YTM is the promised yield—that is, assuming no issuer default.
                              3. The investor reinvests all coupon payments at the same YTM.
                              For example, say we observe that the five-year 3.2% fixed-rate BRWA bond in
                          Example 1 is priced at 108.15. The yield-to-maturity is the solution for the rate, r, in
                          the following equation:
                              108.15 = 1.6/(1 + r)1 + 1.6/(1 + r)2 + … + 101.6/(1 + r)10.
                          The Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets YIELD function may be used for bonds that
                          pay periodic interest:

  =YIELD(settlement, maturity, rate, pr, redemption, fre-
quency, [basis]) where

          settlement is the settlement date entered using the DATE function

          maturity is the maturity date entered using the DATE function

          rate is the semi-annual (or periodic) coupon

          pr is the price per 100 face value

          redemption is the future value at maturity

          frequency is the number of coupons per year

          [basis] is the day-count convention, typically 0 for US bonds (30/360 day
count).
    If we assume the BRWA bond settles and matures on 15 October 2025 and
15 October 2030, respectively, the appropriate entries are DATE(2025,10,15) and
DATE(2030,10,15). The other entries are rate = 1.6%, pr = 108.15, redemption = 100,
frequency = 2, and basis = 0, as follows:
   =YIELD(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2030,10,15),1.6%,108.15,100,2,0)
    Given a price of 108.15, the YIELD function calculates the annual yield-to- matu-
rity for the BRWA bond to be 1.50%. Additionally, since the yield-to-maturity is an
internal rate of return, we can also use the IRR function in Microsoft Excel or Google
Sheets to get the same result.
    Yield-to-maturity, commonly referred to as “yield,” is often used interchangeably
with the market discount rate or required yield and in place of discussing bond prices.
For example, market participants will simply say “yields are rising” rather than “market
discount rates are rising” or “bond prices are falling.”

BONDS WITH NEGATIVE YIELDS-TO-MATURITY

  The yield-to-maturity on a bond may be positive, zero, or negative. Yields on
  many sovereign bonds fell below zero following accommodative monetary pol-
  icies introduced by central banks starting in 2012 in response to below-target
  inflation rates. Bonds with a negative yield-to-maturity include those issued at
  higher yields in the past that have experienced significant price appreciation and
  newly issued zero-coupon sovereign government bonds priced at a premium to
  par value. Bonds are generally not issued with negative coupons.
      In 2020, China issued its first ever negative-yielding sovereign bond denom-
  inated in euros, with terms shown in Exhibit 4.

                             bond since its yield was more than 50 bps above that of European sovereign
                             bonds—the five-year German bund was at approximately –0.74% around the same
                             time —and more generally because many investors sought portfolio exposure to
                             China amid a relative scarcity of euro-denominated Chinese bonds at the time.



                          Flat Price, Accrued Interest, and the Full Price
                          When a bond is priced between coupon payment dates, its price has two components:
                          the flat price (PVFlat) and the accrued interest (AI). The sum of the parts is the full
                          price (PVFull), which also is known as the invoice or “dirty” price.
                              PVFull = PVFlat + AI. 	                                                          (3)
                          The flat price, which is the full price minus the accrued interest, is also called the
                          quoted or “clean” price and is the type of price usually quoted by bond dealers. If a
                          trade takes place, the accrued interest is added to the flat price to obtain the full price
                          paid by the buyer and received by the seller on the trade settlement date. The trade
                          settles when the bond buyer pays and the seller delivers the security.
                              The flat price is used for quotations to avoid misleading investors about a bond’s
                          market price trend. If full prices were quoted by dealers, investors would see price rises
                          each day even if the YTM did not change due to the accrual of interest. Once a coupon
                          payment is made, the quoted price would drop significantly, as shown in Exhibit 5.

The accrued interest is the portion of the next coupon payment owed to the seller of
a bond, because although the seller held the bond for a partial coupon period, the full
coupon will be received by the buyer. To calculate accrued interest, we determine the
fractional amount by counting the days in the period. If the coupon period has T days
between payment dates and t days have passed since the last payment, the accrued
interest is calculated using Equation 4:
   	​AI = _
           t
          ​T ​× PMT,​	                                                                     (4)

where

        t = number of days from the prior coupon payment to the settlement date

        T = number of days in the coupon period

     t/T = fraction of coupon period that has passed since the prior payment

   PMT = coupon payment per period
    Note that the accrued interest portion of the full price does not depend on the
yield-to-maturity. Therefore, it is only the flat price that is affected by a change in
interest rates.
    There are multiple approaches for day counting (or “day counts”). The day count
is specified by two parameters: how days are counted within a given period and
the number of days assumed per period. Two common day count conventions are
30/360 and actual/actual. The 30/360 day count assumes each month has exactly 30
days (although most don’t) and each year has exactly 360 days (although none do). In
contrast, the actual/actual day count convention assumes the actual number of days
in each month and the actual number of days in a year.

EXAMPLE 2

  Actual/Actual vs. 30/360 Day Count
  Consider two otherwise identical bonds that pay 4.375% semiannual interest
  on 15 May and 15 November of each year. One is a government bond with an
  actual/actual day count and the other is a corporate bond with a 30/360 day
  count. The actual/actual method uses the actual number of days, including
  weekends, holidays, and leap days. The 30/360 method assumes 30 days in a
  month and 360 days in each year.
     Calculate accrued interest for settlement on 27 June for both bonds.

                              This is very similar to Equation 2. The difference is that the next coupon payment
                          (PMT) is discounted for the remainder of the coupon period, which is 1 – t/T. The
                          second coupon payment is discounted for that fraction plus another full period, 2 – t/T.
                              Equation 5 is simplified by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by
                          the expression (1 + r)t/T. The result is Equation 6:

                              P ​V​Full​ = [​ _

                                                                             PMT + FV

                                                                        ​(           ​ ​× (​ 1 + r)​t/T​

                              An advantage of Equation 6 is that the expression in the brackets, PV, is easily
                          obtained using the Excel YIELD function because there are N evenly spaced periods.
                          PV here is the present value of future cash flows as of the last coupon date; it is iden-
                          tical to Equation 2 but is not the same as PVFlat.
                              The next two examples demonstrate the calculation of a bond’s flat price, accrued
                          interest, and full price.

     Next, we calculate the full price by counting the days using the specified day
  count convention and using Equation 6.
     Number of days from beginning of period until settlement, t = 90
     Number of days in the period containing settlement, T = 180

      A       180 ​× 1.60​

      	​AI = 0.80​
      Finally, we calculate the flat price using Equation 3 by subtracting the accrued
  interest from the full price.
      	​P ​V​Full​ = P V
                       ​ ​Flat​+ AI​

      	​ ​V​Flat​ = P V
      P               ​ ​Full​− AI​

                             1. Define yield-to-maturity.
                                Solution:
                                Yield-to-maturity is the internal rate of return on a bond’s cash flows—the
                                uniform interest rate such that when the future cash flows are discounted at
                                that rate, the sum of the present values equals the price of the bond.

  2. A non-callable fixed-coupon bond with a maturity in 10 years and a face val-
     ue of 100 is issued with an annual coupon rate of 2.8% when the applicable
     market discount rate is also 2.8%. The price of this bond at issuance is:
      A. less than 100.
      B. exactly 100.
      C. more than 100.
     Solution:
     B is correct. When a bond is issued with a coupon rate that equals the mar-
     ket discount rate, it is priced at par.

  3. A non-callable fixed-coupon bond with a maturity in 10 years and a face
     value of 100 has an annual coupon rate of 2.8%, while the market discount
     rate is 4.0%. The price of this bond at issuance is:
      A. less than 100.
      B. exactly 100.
      C. more than 100.
     Solution:
     A is correct. A bond with a coupon rate lower than the market discount
     rate will trade at a discount to par, to compensate for its “deficient” coupons
     relative to the market rate.

  4. A sovereign bond that matures on 1 January 2030 pays an annual coupon
     of 1.2% and has a face value of 100. For a trade settlement date of 1 January
     2020, the bonds are priced at 128. Calculate the yield-to-maturity as of the
     settlement date and price.
     Solution:
     –1.390%. We use the YIELD function in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets:
      =YIELD(settlement, maturity, rate, pr, redemption,
      frequency,[basis])

      =YIELD(DATE(2020,1,1),DATE(2030,1,1),0.012,128,100,1)

      = -1.390%



  5. A bond with a face value of 100 pays an annual coupon of 12% and matures
     on Ad14 August 2007. It uses the actual/actual day count convention. For a
     settlement date of 23 December 2002 and an annual YTM of 9.75%, calcu-
     late the full price, accrued interest, and flat price. Assume an actual/actual
     day count.
     Solution:

    Step 1   Calculate PV as of the beginning of the current coupon period for the
             settlement date:
      =-PV(rate, nper, pmt, [FV], type)

142   Learning Module 6                                          Fixed-Income Bond Valuation: Prices and Yields



                          Inverse Relationship
                          As seen in the prior lesson, the price of a fixed-rate bond will change as the interest
                          rate used to discount future cash flows changes. For any time-value-of-money cal-
                          culation, a higher discount rate results in a lower present value for any fixed future
                          cash flow and a lower discount rate results in a higher present value. Therefore, bond
                          yields-to-maturity and prices move in opposite directions.


                          Coupon Effect
                          The size of bond coupon cash flows affects how much a bond’s price will change for
                          a given yield change for bonds of the same maturity. The lower a bond’s coupon, the
                          higher the proportion of total cash flow that occurs at maturity. Discounting this final
                          cash flow by the factor of (1 + r)N as shown in Equation 2 magnifies the impact of a
                          given change in r relative to bonds whose final cash flow is a smaller proportion of
                          the total. This coupon effect is best demonstrated by comparing the extreme case of
                          a zero-coupon bond (with 100% of cash flows including cumulative interest paid at
                          maturity) with an otherwise identical fixed-coupon bond, as in the following example.

                           EXAMPLE 5

                             Yield Change Effect for Zero-Coupon vs. Coupon Bond
                             Assume an investor has the choice between the 4.625% fixed-coupon 30-year
                             Romania Eurobond priced at par and an otherwise identical zero-coupon bond
                             from the same issuer at the same yield-to-maturity of 4.625%.
                                 Calculate the percentage change in price for both bond alternatives if YTM
                             rises or falls by 100 bps upon issuance.
                                 Use Equation 1 (zero-coupon bond) and the Excel or Google Sheets PV
                             function (4.625% coupon bond) to calculate and compare these changes. Please

                                 For the same time-to-maturity, a lower-coupon (or zero-coupon) bond has
                             a greater percentage price change than a higher-coupon bond when market
                             discount rates change by the same amount.

Maturity Effect
The time-to-maturity of a bond also affects a bond’s price/yield relationship. Generally,
all else equal, a longer-term bond has a greater percentage price change than a
shorter-term bond when the market discount rates change by the same amount. The
maturity effect is the result of the higher N in Equation 2 for the longer-maturity bond.

EXAMPLE 6

   Yield Change Effect for Different Maturities
   Assume an investor has a choice between Bond A, with a 1.5% fixed coupon
   and a 30-year maturity priced at par, and Bond B, a 10-year, 1.5% fixed-coupon
   bond priced at par from the same issuer.
       Calculate the percentage change in price for these if YTM rises or falls by
   100 bps upon issuance.
       Compare the price changes in the 10-year and 30-year bonds using the PV
   function to calculate and compare these changes. Please refer to the candidate
   learning ecosystem online for a spreadsheet of these calculations in the down-
   loaded Microsoft Excel workbook.

                                            ​




       We see that the percentage price change for the longer-maturity bond is
   larger than that for the shorter-maturity bond. Also, we see that, in price terms,
   the change for a YTM decrease is larger than that for a YTM increase.

    Exceptions to the maturity effect exist but are rare in practice. They occur only
for low-coupon (but not zero-coupon), long-term bonds trading at a discount. The
maturity effect always holds on zero-coupon bonds, as it does for bonds priced at par
value or at a premium above par value.


Constant-Yield Price Trajectory
Bond prices change with the passage of time, even if the market discount rate remains
the same. As time passes, so as N in Equation 2 approaches zero, the bondholder
comes closer to receiving the par value at maturity, provided the issuer does not
default. The constant yield-price trajectory in Exhibit 6 illustrates price changes

                          The 2% coupon bond’s initial price is 76.835 per 100 of par value. The price increases
                          each year and approaches par value as the maturity date nears. The 8% coupon bond’s
                          initial price is 123.165, and it decreases each year, approaching par value as the matu-
                          rity date nears. Both prices are “pulled to par.” Please refer to the candidate learning
                          ecosystem online for a spreadsheet of these calculations in the downloaded Microsoft

                          Convexity Effect
                          The percentage change in a bond’s price will also vary depending on how the yield
                          changes. The percentage price increase is greater, in absolute value, than the percentage
                          price decrease. This implies that the relationship between bond prices and yields is
                          not linear; instead, it is curved and “convex.” Exhibit 7 shows this general relationship
                          between a bond’s price and its yield-to-maturity.

  bond price increase of 3.75%, but an increase in the YTM from 160 bps to 200
  bps results in a smaller bond price decrease. Based on this, we can say that the
  BRWA bond has positive convexity. Convexity will be discussed in greater detail
  in a later lesson.

                                a rate of 4.625% and has a face value of 100. Its issue date is 3 April 2019 and

                                Solution:
                                Given two non-callable, fixed-coupon bonds that have different coupons but
                                are otherwise identical, for a change in yield, the lower-coupon bond will
                                have a greater percentage price change than the higher-coupon bond.

                             3. Describe the maturity effect.
                                Solution:
                                Generally, for two bonds that are identical except for their times-to-maturi-
                                ty, the longer-maturity bond will have a larger percentage price change than
                                will the shorter-maturity bond when yields change by the same amount.

                             4. Two non-callable, fixed-coupon bonds have the same maturity date. One
                                trades at a discount; the other trades at a premium. If the yield stays con-
                                stant until the bonds mature and neither defaults, the two bonds’ prices will,
                                over time:
                                 A. converge.
                                 B. remain unchanged.
                                 C. diverge.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The prices will converge because of the “pull-to-par” effect. As
                                the maturity date nears, the present values of future cash flows will fall or
                                rise to the par value, provided that the issuer does not default.

Matrix Pricing Process
Unlike listed equity securities, most bonds are not actively traded, so there is often
no current market price available to calculate yield-to-maturity. The same problem
occurs for bonds that are not yet issued. In these situations, it is common to estimate
price by using the prices of comparable but more frequently traded bonds. These
comparable bonds have similar times-to-maturity, coupon rates, and credit quality.
This estimation process, illustrated in Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9, is called matrix pricing.

For example, suppose that an analyst needs to value a three-year, 4% semiannual
coupon payment corporate bond, Bond X. Assume that Bond X is not actively traded
and that there are no recent transactions reported for this particular security. Exhibit
10 and Exhibit 11 shows quoted prices and yields-to-maturity for four corporate
bonds with very similar credit quality, in tabular and matrix form (by coupon rate
and time-to-maturity).

Matrix pricing also is used in underwriting new bonds to get an estimate of the
required yield spread over the benchmark rate, or the difference in yield-to-maturity
between the bond and that of a government benchmark bond with the same or a
similar time-to-maturity.
     Suppose that a corporation is about to issue a five-year bond. The corporate issuer
currently has a four-year, 3% annual coupon payment debt liability. The price of that
bond is 102.400 per 100 of par value. This is the full price, which is the same as the
flat price because the accrued interest is zero. This implies that the coupon payment
has just been made and there are four full years to maturity. The four-year rate of
return required by investors for this bond is 2.36%:

Sheets:
   =YIELD(DATE(2025,10,1),DATE(2029,10,1),0.03,102.401,100,2,1)
Suppose that there are no four-year government bonds to calculate the required
yield spread on this security. However, there are three-year and five-year government
bonds that have yields-to-maturity of 0.75% and 1.45%, respectively. The average of
the two yields-to-maturity is 1.10%, which is the estimated yield for the four-year
government bond. Therefore, the estimated required yield spread is 126 bps over the
implied benchmark rate (0.0236 – 0.0110 = 0.0126).
    The issuer now has an estimate of the four-year yield spread: 126 bps. This spread
is a reference point for estimating the five-year spread for the newly issued bond.

QUESTION SET


   1. True or false: Bond price quotes on such platforms as Bloomberg
      often represent the price at which the most recent trade for that bond was
      made.
      A. True
       B. False
      Solution:
      False. Most bonds are infrequently traded, so price quotes on such platforms
      as Bloomberg are often estimated using matrix pricing methods.

   2. An analyst is estimating a price for an illiquid four-year, 4.5% annual cou-
      pon payment corporate bond. The analyst identifies two corporate bonds
      that have similar credit quality: One is a three-year, 5.50% annual coupon
      payment bond priced at 107.500 per 100 of par value, and the other is a five-
      year, 4.50% annual coupon payment bond priced at 104.750 per 100 of par
      value. Using matrix pricing, the estimated price of the illiquid bond per 100
      of par value is closest to:
      A. 103.895.
      B. 104.991.
       C. 106.125.
      Solution:
      B is correct. The first step is to determine the yields-to-maturity on the
      observed bonds. The required yield on the three-year, 5.50% bond priced at
      107.500 is 2.856%:

                          7. An analyst is analyzing a bond that will soon be issued by XYZ Company. The
                             new bond will have five years to maturity and a 2.25% coupon, paid semiannually.
                             XYZ has never issued bonds before, so the analyst will use matrix pricing. The
                             analyst has identified four similar bonds with the following characteristics.

    SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. The absolute amount of the price increase would be more than the
   absolute amount of the price decrease for the same absolute change in YTM
   because of the convex relationship between bond price and yield.
   A is incorrect because of the positive convex relationship between bond price
   and yield. For a given level of yield change, the price rise for that given amount
   of yield decrease will be larger than the price decline for that amount of yield
   increase.
   B is incorrect because the relationship between bond price and yield is not linear.

2. A is correct. Exceptions to the maturity effect are rare and occur only for
   low-coupon (but not zero-coupon) long-term bonds trading at a discount.
   B is incorrect because the maturity effect holds for bonds that have short matur-
   ities and high coupons.
   C is incorrect because the maturity effect always holds on bonds priced at a pre-
   mium above par value.

3. B is correct. Any bond trading at a discount will increase in price because of the
   pull-to-par effect.
   A is incorrect because the price–yield relationship generally becomes less convex
   as a bond approaches maturity.
   C is incorrect because a high-coupon bond trading at a premium will decrease in
   price as it approaches maturity.

4. A is correct. The bond’s periodic coupon rate exceeds the periodic market dis-
   count rate, or its coupon rate is “excessive” relative to the market. Therefore, the
   bond will trade at a premium to par.
   B is incorrect. For the bond to trade at par, the coupon rate and market discount
   rate (yield-to-maturity) must be equal.
   C is incorrect. For the bond to trade at a discount, the yield-to-maturity would
   have to be higher than the coupon rate.

5. B is correct. Two approaches to calculating the yield-to-maturity are calculating
   an IRR or using the YIELD function in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The
   periodic IRR is annualized by multiplying by two.

Period                     Cash Flow            YIELD Function

Periodic IRR             0.67%
Annualized IRR           1.34%

    A is incorrect because 0.67% is the periodic, not annualized, yield-to-maturity.

                              C is incorrect. Note that this choice can be eliminated because the bond is trad-
                              ing at a premium; thus its yield-to-maturity is lower than its coupon rate of 2.0%.
                              Please refer to the candidate learning ecosystem online for a spreadsheet of these
                              calculations in the downloaded Microsoft Excel workbook.

                          6. C is correct. The flat price, quoted by bond dealers, is the full price less accrued
                             interest. Accrued interest is not included in the flat price.
                             A is incorrect. The buyer must pay the full price, which already includes accrued
                             interest.
                             B is incorrect. The flat price is the quoted price.

                          7. To price the new XYZ bond, the analyst should group yields for comparable
                             bonds in a matrix with maturities and coupon rates.

                                                                                           1
(YTMs), as well as other features, such as coupon rate and time-to-maturity. Two
important considerations for interpreting and determining yields-to-maturity and
other yield measures are the assumed frequency of compounding interest and the
presence of embedded options that could affect cash flow amounts or timing. This
module explores these considerations and extends the analysis of yields by introducing
spread measures, which compare yields to benchmark rates to ascertain how much
an investor would be compensated for taking certain risks.
    Most of the examples and exhibits used throughout the reading can be downloaded
as a Microsoft Excel workbook. Each worksheet in the workbook is labeled with the
corresponding example or exhibit number in the text.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Yields-to-maturity allow analysts to use a single measure to
          compare bonds with varying maturities and coupons. An
          important factor in yield determination and interpretation is the fre-
          quency of compounding, known as periodicity.
      ■   All else equal, more frequent compounding results in greater future
          values or returns. Therefore, compounding more frequently at a lower
          rate can be equivalent to compounding less frequently at a higher rate;
          the more frequent compounding makes up for the lower rate.

                                 ■   Prices and yields of bonds with embedded options require adjustments
                                     to reflect the value of the option. The option-adjusted yield spread and
                                     yield-to-worst are measures that reflect option values.
                                 ■   Yield measures for a bond, as well as changes in them, can be decom-
                                     posed into a benchmark rate and a spread over the benchmark rate.
                                     Benchmark rates reflect macroeconomic, “top-down” conditions that
                                     affect all bonds in a market, while spreads capture issuer-specific,
                                     “bottom-up” factors, such as credit risk, liquidity, and taxation.
                                 ■   Similar to how a yield curve graphically depicts the relationship
                                     between yields-to-maturity and times-to-maturity for securities with
                                     the same risk profile, benchmark rates and spreads can be graphed by
                                     time-to-maturity as well, to show the term structure of credit spreads.

                             These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                             of understanding of the learning module.

                             1. Complete the sentences by filling in the blanks using the following words:

                                standardized

                                Both capital market securities’ yields and money market rates with maturity
                                dates shorter than one year are _________________. However, money mar-
                                ket rates are not ________________.
                                Solution:
                                Both capital market securities’ yields and money market rates with maturity
                                dates shorter than one year are annualized. However, money market rates
                                are not compounded.

                             2. A three-year sovereign non-callable bond is priced at 106.24 per 100. The
                                bond pays a 2% semiannual coupon. The annual yield-to-maturity for the
                                bond is closest to:
                                 A. 0.077%.
                                 B. 0.039%.
                                 C. 1.883%.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Given that the bond pays coupons semiannually, the semiannu-
                                al yield-to-maturity is calculated by solving for r in the following equation.
                                Additionally, the IRR or YIELD functions in Microsoft Excel and Google
                                Sheets can be used.

                                                                                 101

     r = − 0.00038596.
     Given that the yield is expressed in semiannual terms, it needs to be annual-
     ized by multiplying by 2, which results in –0.000772, or –0.077%.
     B is incorrect because it is the semiannual, not annual, yield.
     C is incorrect because 1.883% is the bond’s current yield, not
     yield-to-maturity.

  3. A fixed-income analyst obtains the following data for three corporate bonds

     Solution:
     The G-spread for Bond B is (0.01271 – 0.011) = 173 bps.
     Before computing the G-spreads for Bonds A and C, the yields-to-maturity
     must first be converted to a periodicity of two. The semiannual equivalent
     yield for Bond A is 1.267%:
                         m                      n
      ​(1 + _

                        ​ 1+_   ​ ​ ​.
                           AP ​R​ ​ 2​​
           ​ 1 ​)​ ​ = (   ​ 2 2 ​)​ ​.
        
        
      	​   0.01271 1
     ​(1 + _           ​ 1+_
     AP ​R2​ ​ = 0.01267 = 1.267 % .
     Thus, its G-spread is (0.01267 – 0.011) = 167 bps.
     The semiannual equivalent yield for Bond C is 1.1797%:
                         m                      n
      (   ​ m ​)​ ​ = (   ​ n )
          AP ​Rm
               ​​         AP ​Rn​ ​
      ​ 1+_           ​ 1+_       ​ ​ ​.
                              AP ​R​ ​ 2 ​​
                    ​ ​​= (   ​ 2 2 ​)​ ​.
        
        
      	​     0.01178 4
     ​(1 + _ ​ 4 )        ​ 1+_
     AP ​R2​ ​ = 0.011797 = 1.1797 % .
     Thus, its G-spread is (0.011797 – 0.011) = 8 bps.

  4. If a bond has an embedded call option and the value of the call option is
     positive, the option-adjusted price, compared to the flat price of the bond, is
     most likely:
      A. lower.
      B. the same.
      C. higher.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The value of the call option is the price of the option-free bond
     minus the price of the callable bond. If the value of the call option is posi-

                                tive, then the option-adjusted price is lower compared to the flat price of the
                                bond.
                                B is incorrect because if the value of the call option is positive, the op-
                                tion-adjusted price compared to the flat price of the bond is lower, not the
                                same.
                                C is incorrect because if the value of the call option is positive, the op-
                                tion-adjusted price compared to the flat price of the bond is lower, not
                                higher.




              2           PERIODICITY AND ANNUALIZED YIELDS

                                        calculate annual yield on a bond for varying compounding periods in
                                        a year

                          Investors analyzing bonds with various cash flow and maturity profiles seek a stan-
                          dardized yield measure to compare across different choices. Yield measures are usu-
                          ally annualized in order to allow a direct comparison. For capital market securities
                          maturing in more than one year, investors want an annualized and compounded
                          yield-to-maturity. Conventions for instruments maturing in one year or less will be
                          covered in a later lesson.
                              An annualized and compounded yield on a fixed-rate bond depends on the assumed
                          number of interest periods in the year, which is called the periodicity of the annual
                          rate. The periodicity typically matches the frequency of coupon payments. For exam-
                          ple, the fixed-coupon five-year bond issued by Bright Wheels Automotive (BRWA)
                          from earlier lessons pays semiannual coupons with a stated annual yield-to-maturity
                          of 3.2% for a periodicity of 2—the rate per semiannual period (1.6%) times 2. A bond
                          that pays quarterly coupons has a stated annual yield for a periodicity of 4—the rate
                          per quarter times 4.
                              Exhibit 1 shows how a 5% stated annual yield-to-maturity generates different
                          amounts in one year with annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly compounding based
                          on a fixed-rate par bond priced at 100.

The bond interest amounts on the right-hand side of Exhibit 1 expressed as percentages
are known as effective annual rates. An effective annual rate has a periodicity of 1
because there is just one compounding period in the year. For example, for a quarterly
coupon bond that pays 1.25% per period, or an annual coupon rate of (1.25% × 4)
= 5%, each coupon received is assumed to be reinvested at the periodic rate—here,
1.25%—for the remainder of the year. We can solve for the future value of these cash
flows using the Excel or Google Sheets FV function:
   =FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type]),
where

        rate is the periodic reinvestment rate

        nper is the number of periods in a year

        pmt is the rate per period

        [pv] is the present value

         [type] indicates when payments occur, with 0 designating payment at the end
of each period
   For the quarterly coupon bond:
   =FV(0.0125,4,1.25,0,0) = 5.0945.
    Therefore, assuming each coupon is reinvested at 1.25% through the end of the
year, a quarterly coupon bond with an annual stated rate of 5% generates the same
interest as an annual coupon bond with a stated rate of 5.0945%. The Excel or Google
Sheets EFFECT function may also be used to calculate the effective annual rate for a
given number of compounding periods per year.
    The most common periodicity in the United States, the United Kingdom, and sev-
eral other fixed-income markets is 2 because most bonds in these jurisdictions make
semiannual coupon payments. An annual rate having a periodicity of two is known as
a semiannual bond basis yield, or semiannual bond equivalent yield. Therefore, a
semiannual bond basis yield is the yield per semiannual period times 2. It is important
to remember that “semiannual bond basis yield” and “yield per semiannual period”
have different meanings. For example, if a bond yield is 2% per semiannual period,
its annual yield is 4% when stated on a semiannual bond basis.

                                        The periodicity of the annual market discount rate for a zero-coupon bond is
                                        arbitrary because there are no coupon payments. Consider a five-year, zero-cou-

                                             The compounded total return is the same for each expression for the annual
                                        rate. They differ in terms of the number of compounding periods per year—that
                                        is, in terms of the periodicity of the annual rate. For a given pair of cash flows,
                                        the stated annual rate and the periodicity are inversely related.

                                         An important tool in fixed-income analysis is the conversion of an annualized
                                     yield using one periodicity to another periodicity. These are called periodicity, or
                                     compounding, conversions. Equation 1 shows a general formula to convert an annual

An annual yield-to-maturity of 3.582% for semiannual compounding provides the
same rate of return as annual yields of 3.566% and 3.556% for quarterly and monthly
compounding, respectively. A general rule for periodicity conversions is compounding
more frequently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a
higher annual rate. This rule can be used to check periodicity conversion calculations.

EXAMPLE 2

  Comparing Strip Bonds to Coupon Bonds
  Financial intermediaries can own coupon bonds and then issue individual
  zero-coupon bonds composed of coupon or principal payments from the cou-
  pon bonds. These zero-coupon bonds are known as strip bonds. Strip bonds are
  attractive to investors seeking to match known cash flows on a specific future date.
      A 20-year government of Canada strip (zero-coupon) bond is priced at
  69.4300 per 100. An analyst wants to compare the yield of the strip bond with
  that of a newly issued 20-year coupon bond. Both the strip bond and the coupon
  bond are non-callable. The 20-year coupon bond pays semiannual coupons of
  2%, and its current price is 101.99 per 100, which corresponds to a semiannual
  bond equivalent yield of 1.880%.
      The analyst will compute a semiannual bond equivalent yield for the strip
  bond and compare it to the semiannual bond equivalent yield of 1.880% of the
  20-year coupon bond.
      There are two approaches. The first involves calculating a yield-to-matu-
  rity assuming annual compounding for the strip bond and converting it to
  a semiannual equivalent bond yield. The second approach involves directly
  computing a semiannual yield-to-maturity for the strip bond and annualizing
  it by multiplying it by 2.



  Approach 1
  The 20-year strip bond does not pay any coupons, so as the first step, we assume
  annual compounding (periodicity of 1) to calculate an effective annual rate based
  on the current price and remaining years to maturity.

                ​(1 + r)​ ​

  The next step is to convert the effective annual rate to semiannual bond equiv-
  alent yield. This is done by using Equation 1 to convert from a periodicity of 1
  to a periodicity of 2.

                             Approach 2
                             Alternatively, we can assume that compounding happens semiannually (period-
                             icity of two) and the effective rate calculated would be semiannual.

                             To annualize this, we multiply it by 2 and obtain the same result as the first
                             approach: 1.833%.

                             Assume the German government issues a five-year zero-coupon bond at a price
                             of 103.72. Calculate the effective annual rate of the bond at issuance assuming
                             annual, semiannual, and monthly compounding.



                             Solution:
                             First, we can calculate the German bond’s yield-to-maturity as an effective annual
                             rate assuming the periodicity of 1.

                             1. A bond has a yield-to-maturity of –0.50% using annual compound-
                                ing. If the yield is converted to monthly compounding, it will most likely be:
                                 A. greater than –0.50%.
                                 B. equal to –0.50%.

      C. less than –0.50%.
     Solution:
     C is correct. A general rule for periodicity conversions is compounding
     more frequently within the year corresponds to a lower (or more negative)
     yield-to-maturity.

  2. Convert a yield of 1.736% compounded monthly to an effective annual rate.
     Solution:
     The effective annual rate assumes only one compounding period in a year
     (periodicity of 1). Converting from monthly to annual compounding re-
     quires converting from a periodicity of 12 to 1:
                     m                    n

  3. When calculating yield-to-maturity for a strip (zero-coupon) bond, the peri-
     odicity must be 1.

     Justify your answer.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution
     False. The periodicity of the annual market discount rate for a zero-coupon
     bond is arbitrary because there are no coupon payments. For example, a
     yield calculated using quarterly periodicity (4) can simply be converted to a
     yield with annual periodicity (1).

Other Yield Measures and Conventions
The current yield, a simple measure equal to a bond’s annual coupon divided by the
flat price, was introduced in an earlier lesson. For example, if the BRWA 3.2% semi-
annual fixed-coupon five-year bond introduced earlier were trading at a price of 98.7
per $100 in face value at time t, its current yield would be
   CYt = Annual coupont/Bond pricet                                              (2)

   = 3.2%/0.987 = 3.242%.

                          The current yield is a crude measure of return because it focuses solely on interest
                          income, ignoring the frequency of coupon payments, interest on interest (time value
                          of money), and accrued interest. In addition to collecting and reinvesting coupon pay-
                          ments, the investor has a gain if the bond is purchased at a discount and is redeemed
                          at par value. The investor has a loss if the bond is purchased at a premium and is
                          redeemed at par value.
                              In practice, the actual timing of cash flows is important for quoting and calculating
                          bond yields-to-maturity. Consider from earlier the 30-year 4.625% annual coupon
                          Romania eurobond maturing on 3 April 2049. Suppose that for settlement on 3 April
                          2026, the bond is priced at 97.3684 per 100 of par value to yield 4.75% quoted on an
                          annual, actual/actual basis. Its coupon payment is scheduled for 3 April of each year.
                          The yield calculation implicitly assumes that the payments are made on those exact
                          dates. This calculation ignores the fact that several of those dates are not business days.
                          For example, both 3 April 2027 and 3 April 2032 are Saturdays, so investors will receive
                          coupon payments on the following Mondays, 5 April 2027 and 2032, respectively.
                              Yield measures that assume payments are made on scheduled dates and that do not
                          account for weekends and holidays are quoted on what is called street convention.
                          This assumption simplifies bond price and yield calculations and commonly is used
                          in practice. A true yield that uses the actual payment dates (e.g., 5 April 2027 and
                          2032 in the Romania bond example), accounting for weekends and holidays, can also
                          be computed. The true yield is never higher than the street convention yield because
                          weekends and holidays delay the time to payment. The difference is typically small,
                          no more than a basis point or two. Therefore, the true yield is not commonly used
                          in practice.
                              Recall that corporate bond yields typically use the 30/360 day count convention.
                          Sometimes, these yields are restated using an actual/actual day count, known as a
                          government equivalent yield. The government equivalent yield on a corporate bond
                          can be used to obtain the spread (difference) over a government bond yield.

                           EXAMPLE 4

                             Government Equivalent Yield for BRWA Five-Year Bond
                             In an earlier example, BRWA issued a 3.2% semiannual fixed-coupon five-year
                             bond at par. As is standard for corporate bonds, the BRWA bond yield is calcu-
                             lated on a 30/360 day count basis. The comparable five-year US Treasury bond
                             yields 2.3%, but as a government bond, the yield is calculated using the actual/
                             actual day count basis. While the yield difference appears to be 90 bps (= 3.2%
                             – 2.3%), the day count bases differ.
                                 Calculate the government equivalent yield for the BRWA bond and show
                             the yield difference between the BRWA and government bonds based on the
                             same day count basis.
                                 Solution:
                                 A simple approximation for restating a corporate bond yield from the 30/360
                             day count basis to the actual/actual day count basis is to multiply the BRWA
                             bond yield by 365/360.

       The bond equivalent yield for the BRWA bond is 3.2444%; hence, the
   yield-to-maturity difference between two bonds is 94.4 bps (= 3.2444% – 2.3%).

   Sometimes the simple yield on a bond is quoted. It is the sum of the coupon pay-
ments plus the straight-line amortized share of the gain or loss, divided by the flat price.
Simple yields are used mostly to quote Japanese government bonds, known as JGBs.



  Exhibit 3: Summary of Yield Conventions

Convention                                             Meaning

Actual/Actual           Actual number of days from prior coupon payment to settlement
(Act/Act)               date/number of days in a coupon period, assuming the actual number
                        of days in a year. Typically used with government bonds.
30/360                  Number of days from prior coupon payment to settlement date,
                        assuming 30 days in a month/number of days in a coupon period,
                        assuming 360 days in a year. Typically used with corporate bonds.
Street Convention       Yield measure that does not account for weekends and bank holidays
                        and thus assumes cash flows are paid on their scheduled dates.
True Yield              Yield measure that accounts for weekends and bank holidays and thus
                        assumes cash flows are paid after their scheduled dates. True yield is
                        never higher than street convention yield due to the delay in time to
                        payment.
Government              Yield measure that restates a yield-to-maturity based on a 30/360 day
Equivalent Yield        count to one based on an actual/actual day count. It is used to restate
                        the YTM on a corporate bond to obtain the spread over the govern-
                        ment YTM.
Simple Yield                     Yield measure that is the sum of coupon payments plus the
                        straight-line amortized share of the gain or loss, divided by the flat
                        price. It is used mostly to quote Japanese government bonds (JGBs).

                                 2. The analyst believes that the BRWA bond has less risk than the
                                    Antelas AG bond. How much additional compensation, in terms of
                                    basis points of yield-to-maturity, does a buyer of the Antelas AG bond
                                    receive for bearing this risk compared with the BRWA bond?
                                 Solution to 1:
                                 Recall that the current yield is the annual coupon expressed as a percentage
                             of a bond’s flat price.

                                 Recall that the yield-to-maturity is an internal rate of return, the discount
                             rate r that equates the price of a bond to the present value of future cash flows.
                                 PV = PMT1/(1 + r)1 + PMT2/(1 + r)2 + … + (PMTN + FVN)/(1 + r)N.
                                 The yield-to-maturity can also be calculated using the YIELD and IRR func-

                             tions. Therefore, the difference in the yields is not 177 bps (0.04548 – 0.02780).
                             It is essential to compare the yields for the same periodicity to make a statement
                             about relative value.

                             converts to 4.574% for a periodicity of 2:

       When the yields-to-maturity for the Antelas AG and BRWA bonds are stated
   on a common periodicity, the additional yield that the buyer of the BRWA bond
   receives to compensate for its higher risk, compared to the Antelas AG bond,
   is (0.04574 – 0.02780) =179 bps.



Bonds with Embedded Options
If a fixed-rate bond contains an embedded option, other yield measures are used.
Recall from an earlier lesson that these bond contingency provisions cannot be
removed and traded separately from the bond. For example, a callable bond gives the
issuer the right to buy the bond back from the investor. This occurs at specific prices
on pre-determined dates after a call protection period during which the issuer is not
allowed to exercise the call option.
    For example, an earlier lesson on callable bonds introduced Vivivyu Inc. (VIVU)
seven-year callable notes (see Exhibit 4).

Interest Payment:            Starting six months from [Settlement] to be paid semiannually

                             Business Day before [Maturity] starting three years after
                             [Settlement] based upon the Call Price Schedule as a percent-
                             age of the Principal Amount plus accrued interest
Call Price Schedule:         103.25% [Three to Four Years after Settlement]
                             102.50% [Four to Five Years after Settlement]
                             101.75% [Five to Six Years after Settlement]
                             101.00% [Six to Seven Years after Settlement]

The VIVU bond may not be called for the first three years, but the following year it
may be called at a price of $103.25 per $100 in face value. VIVU has the right to call
the bond for the final four years based on a fixed price schedule. Investors facing call
risk starting in Year 3 often estimate the lowest possible yield earned by calculating
the sequence of yields corresponding to the bond’s call dates.
    Traditional yield-to-maturity measures assume that all cash flows occur as prom-
ised and therefore must be modified for callable bonds. Analysts must use alternative
return measures that take the bond’s call feature into account, such as the yield to
the first call date, the second call date, and so on. The yield-to-call is calculated by
modifying the general formula for calculating yield-to-maturity.

    The lowest of the sequence of yields-to-call and the yield-to-maturity is known
as the yield-to-worst. For the VIVU bond, it is the yield-to-first call of 5.15%. The
intent of this measure is to provide to the investor the most conservative measure
for the rate of return.
    The yield-to-worst is a commonly cited yield measure for fixed-rate callable bonds
used by bond dealers and investors. However, a more precise approach is to use an
option pricing model and an assumption about future interest rate volatility to value
the embedded call option. The value of the embedded call option is added to the flat
price of the bond to get the option-adjusted price. The investor bears the call risk
(the bond issuer has the option to call), so the embedded call option reduces the
value of the bond from the investor’s perspective. The investor pays a lower price for
the callable bond than if it were option-free. If the bond were non-callable, its price
would be higher. The option-adjusted price is used to calculate the option-adjusted
yield. The option-adjusted yield is the required market discount rate whereby the
price is adjusted for the value of the embedded option. The value of the call option is
the price of the option-free bond minus the price of the callable bond.

  3. The current yield of the sovereign bond is approximately:
      A. 140 bps lower than the current yield of the corporate bond.
      B. 340 bps lower than the current yield of the corporate bond.
      C. 140 bps higher than the current yield of the corporate bond.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The current yield is the annual coupon expressed as a percent-
     age of a bond’s price. The current yield of the corporate bond is 440 bps,
     while the current yield of the sovereign bond is 98 bps, 342 bps lower.

  4. The yield-to-first call of the corporate bond is closest to:
      A. 2.15%.
      B. 7.80%.
      C. 15.00%.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The yield-to-first call is the internal rate of return r for a call-
     able bond assuming it is called at its earliest scheduled call date for its call
     price.

Yield Spreads over Benchmark Rates
In fixed-income security analysis, it is important to understand why bond prices and
yields-to-maturity change. To do this, it is useful to decompose a yield-to-maturity
into a base rate or benchmark and an issuer-specific spread. For example, an earlier
lesson introduced government benchmark bonds as the most liquid securities with the
lowest default risk for a specific time-to-maturity in each market. The yield spread
is the difference between the yield-to-maturity and the benchmark yield.
    These two components help investors distinguish between macroeconomic
(top-down) and microeconomic (bottom-up) factors that affect the bond price and,
therefore, its yield-to-maturity. The benchmark rate captures the top-down factors,
while the spread captures the bottom-up factors, as shown in Exhibit 5.

                          The most used benchmark rate is the most recently issued government bond, known
                          as an on-the-run security. The on-the-run government bond is the most actively
                          traded security and has a coupon rate closest to the current market discount rate for
                          that maturity. That implies that it is priced close to par value. Seasoned government
                          bonds are called off-the-run. On-the-run bonds typically trade at slightly lower
                          yields-to-maturity than off-the-run bonds with the same or similar times-to-maturity
                          because of differences in demand for the securities and, sometimes, differences in the
                          cost of financing the government security in the repo market.
                              The yield spread over a specific benchmark is referred to as the benchmark
                          spread and represents the risk premium for the credit and liquidity risks and possibly
                          the tax impact of holding a specific bond. Exhibit 6 shows the relationship between
                          yields-to-maturity for a specific issuer and a benchmark government yield curve.

Spreads allow an analyst to better assess a bond’s relative value on a historical and
comparative basis by controlling for (excluding) macroeconomic factors, such as a
broad increase or decrease in benchmark rates. An analyst might compare the current
spread relative to its historical average and its past highs and lows and to other bonds
to help identify whether a bond is under- or overpriced on a relative basis.
    The yield spread in basis points over an actual or interpolated government bond
yield is known as the G-spread and represents the return for bearing risks relative to
the sovereign bond. If there is no sovereign benchmark bond that matches the matu-
rity of the bond, an approximation process for finding the G-spread must be used, as
illustrated in Exhibit 7 and shown in the following example.

                                     sovereign benchmark bonds         between the bond’s
                                     with maturities closest to        current YTM and the
                                     (below/above) the given           interpolated (appproximate)
                                     bond’s maturity, to find          sovereign
                                     an approximate sovereign          benchmark rate.
                                     rate matching the given
                                     bond’s maturity.

                                 Six years after the original issuance date, on 15 March 2026, the bond is
                             trading at a price of 123.5 per 100 face value, and an analyst observes that 20-year
                             and 30-year US Treasury yields are currently 2.00% and 2.25%, respectively.
                             Calculate the current G-spread of the Russian Federation bond.

                               Step 1      Calculate the current yield-to-maturity of the Russian Federation
                                           bond. We may solve for r using the general formula for bond price
                                           and yield:
                                 PV = PMT1/(1 + r)1 + PMT2/(1 + r)2 + … + (PMTN + FVN)/(1 + r)N.

                               Or we can use the Excel or Google Sheets YIELD function assuming a settle-
                                 ment date of 15 March 2026:
                                 =YIELD(DATE(2026,3,15),DATE(2050,3,15),5.25%,123.5,100,2,0)

                                 = 3.756%.

                               Step 2      Linearly interpolate the current 20-year (r20y) and 30-year (r30y) US
                                           Treasury yields to solve for an approximate 24-year (r24y) US Treasury
                                           benchmark:
                                    1. Solve for the weights of the 20-year and the 30-year bonds in the
                                       interpolation calculation:
                                 20-year bond weight = w20 = 60% [= (30 – 24)/(30 – 20)].

                                 30-year bond weight = w30 = 40%, or (1 – w20).

                                           Note that (w20 × 20) + (w30 × 30) = 24.
                                    2. The 24-year government rate is a weighted average of the 20-year
                                       bond rate and the 30-year US Treasury rate using the weights
                                       above.
                                 r24y = w20 × r20y + w30 × r30y

Yield Spread Measures for Fixed-Rate Bonds and Matrix Pricing                                                                                                                                                    175


      = (60% × 2.00%) + (40% × 2.25%) = 2.10%.

    Step 3              The G-spread is the difference between the current Russian
                        Federation bond yield-to-maturity and the 24-year US government
                        rate:
      1.656% = 3.756% – 2.10%, so the G-spread is 166 bps.

    The yield spread for a bond over the standard swap rate in that currency of the
same tenor is known as the I-spread or interpolated spread. This type of spread is a
comparison against a short-term market-based reference rate and is common practice
for pricing and quoting euro-denominated corporate bonds, using a euro interest rate
swap as the benchmark. For example, the five-year zero-coupon euro bond issued
by the Chinese government at a negative yield-to-maturity from a prior lesson was
priced at a rate of “mid-swaps plus 30 bps,” where “mid-swaps” is the average of the
bid and offered swap rates.
    Issuers will use the I-spread to determine the relative cost of fixed-rate bonds
versus floating-rate alternatives, such as a bank loan or commercial paper, while
investors use it as a measure of a bond’s credit risk. Whereas a standard interest rate
swap involves an exchange of fixed for floating cash flows based on a floating index, an
asset swap converts the periodic fixed coupon of a specific bond to a market reference
rate (MRR) plus or minus a spread. If the bond is priced close to par, this conversion
approximates the price of a bond’s credit risk over the MRR index.

176   Learning Module 7                                    Yield and Yield Spread Measures for Fixed-Rate Bonds


                                 The yield spreads are in the top left corner. On the date of analysis:
                                  ■   The yield spread over a particular Treasury benchmark was 72 bps.
                                  ■   The G-spread over an interpolated government bond yield was 76 bps.
                                      The spread over the benchmark and the G-spread sometimes differ by
                                      a few basis points, especially if the benchmark maturity differs from
                                      that of the underlying bond.
                                  ■   The bond’s I-spread was 106 bps. An I-spread larger than the G-spread
                                      indicates that Treasury yields were slightly higher than swap rates at
                                      that time.
                                The use of these spreads in investment strategies will be covered in more
                             detail later. In general, an analyst will track these spreads relative to their averages
                             and historical highs and lows to identify relative value.



                          Yield Spreads over the Benchmark Yield Curve
                          Whereas the G-spread and I-spread are the difference between two single numbers
                          and use the same discount rate (yield-to-maturity) for each cash flow, a different
                          approach is to calculate a constant yield spread over a government (or interest rate
                          swap) spot curve, or series of yields. This spread is known as the zero-volatility spread
                          (Z-spread) of a bond over the benchmark rate. In other words, the Z-spread is what
                          must be added to each benchmark spot rate to make the present value of a bond’s
                          cash flows equal its price. In Example 8, the Z-spread for the Apple bond, as quoted
                          using the Bloomberg FIRV function, was 109 bps.
                              The Z-spread over the benchmark spot curve can be calculated with Equation 4:
                                                                                  PMT + FV
                              	​PV = _
                                     ​ PMT 1 ​+ _        ​ PMT ​+ ⋯ + _     ​                ​.​	                 (4)
                                     (​ 1 + ​z​1​+ Z)​ ​ ​(1 + ​z​2​+ Z)​2​ ​(1 + ​z​N​+ Z)​N​

                              The benchmark spot or zero rates—z1, z2, . . . , zN—are derived from the government
                          yield curve (or from fixed rates on interest rate swaps), as shown in detail in a later
                          lesson. Z is the Z-spread per period and is the same for all time periods. In Equation
                          4, N is an integer, so the calculation is on a coupon date when the accrued interest is
                          zero. Sometimes, the Z-spread is called the “static spread” because it is constant (and
                          has zero volatility). In practice, the Z-spread is usually calculated in a spreadsheet
                          using a goal seek function or similar solver function.
                              The Z-spread is also used to calculate the option-adjusted spread (OAS) on a
                          callable bond. The OAS, like the option-adjusted yield, is based on an option-pricing
                          model and an assumption about future interest rate volatility. Then, the value of the
                          embedded call option, which is stated in basis points per year, is subtracted from the
                          yield spread.
                              OAS = Z-spread – Option value in basis points per year.                             (5)
                              This important measure is covered in detail later.

Type                                                       Description

G-spread                  Government spread, the yield spread in basis points over an actual or
                          interpolated government bond. Used in the US, the UK, Japan, and
                          other jurisdictions.
I-spread                  Interpolated spread, the yield spread of a bond over the standard swap
                          rate in the same currency and with the same tenor. Euro-denominated
                          corporate bonds are typically priced vs. a euro interest rate swap
                          benchmark.
Z-spread                  Zero-volatility spread, a constant yield spread over a government (or
                          interest rate swap) spot curve used to derive the term structure of
                          credit spreads for an issuer.
Option-adjusted           The Z-spread adjusted for the value of an embedded call option.

EXAMPLE 9

   The G-Spread and Z-Spread
   A 1.5% semiannual coupon, US dollar–denominated bond was issued by PT
   Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF) three years ago. Currently, the bond has
   two years remaining to maturity and is trading at a price of 100.45. The two-
   year, 0.75% semiannual payment government benchmark bond is trading at a
   price of 100.750.
       The government spot rates (stated as effective annual rates) are as follows:

        1. Calculate the G-spread for the IIF bond.
      2. Calculate the Z-spread for the IIF bond.
      Solution:
      The G-spread is the yield spread in basis points over an actual or interpolated
   government bond. The yield-to-maturity for the IIF bond is 1.271%:
                       0.75       0.75        0.75       100.75

                                          ​        ​+ _
                                                      ​        ​.
           
        	​       ​(1 + r)​1​ ​(1 + r)​2​ ​(1 + r)​3​ ​(1 + r)​4​ ​
       r = 0.006357 × 2 = 0.01271.
        The yield-to-maturity for the relevant government benchmark bond is 0.373%:
                      0.375       0.375      0.375       100.375
        100.45 = _
                 ​         ​+ _
                              ​        ​+ _
                                          ​        ​+ _
                                                      ​        .​
           
        	​       ​(1 + r)​1​ ​(1 + r)​2​ ​(1 + r)​3​ ​(1 + r)​4​ ​
       r = 0.0018662 × 2 = 0.00373.
       Therefore, the G-spread is 0.01271 – 0.00373 = 89 bps.
       Solution:
       The Z-spread is a constant yield spread over a government spot or interest
   rate swap curve.

                                The two components of yield—the benchmark and the spread—allow us to
                                distinguish macroeconomic and microeconomic factors.
                                The benchmark yield captures the macroeconomic factors: the expected
                                rate of inflation in the currency in which the bond is denominated, general
                                economic growth and the business cycle, foreign exchange rates, and the
                                impact of monetary and fiscal policy. Changes in those factors impact all
                                bonds in the market.
                                The yield spread captures the microeconomic factors specific to the bond
                                issuer and the bond itself: credit risk, liquidity and trading in comparable
                                securities, and the tax status of the bond.

  3. Which bond most likely has the greatest credit risk?
        A. Bond A
        B. Bond B
         C. Bond C
        Solution:
        B is correct. As a “bottom-up” or issuer-specific risk factor, credit risk is a
        component of a yield spread. To estimate which bond most likely has the
        greatest credit risk, we calculate the I-spread, or the yield spread for a bond
        over a swap rate for the same currency and tenor.

                                tor the least relative value?
                                 A. Bond A

                                 C. Bond C
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. If the bonds are judged to be comparable in all material re-
                                spects, then the least (most) relative value corresponds to the bond with the
                                lowest (highest) spread. At 96 bps, Bond A has the lowest spread and thus
                                the least attractive valuation to an investor.

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. As a first step, we need to calculate the quarterly yield and annualize
   it:
                                               PMT + FV
   	​PV = _
          ​ PMT 1 ​+ _
                     ​ PMT 2 ​+ ... + _

             ​(1 + r)​ ​   ​(1 + r)​ ​          ​(1 + r)​ ​

                   0.8125         0.8125           100.8125
   9	​ 7.28 = _
              ​      _
                1 ​+ ​
                                  _

                 ​(1 + r)​ ​    ​(1 + r)​ ​        ​(1 + r)​ ​

   	​r = 0.01055 × 4 = 0.0422.​
   The next step is to convert the annualized quarterly yield to the semiannual bond
   basis yield.
                     m                        n

   	​AP ​R2​ ​ = 0.04242 = 4.242 % .​
   A is incorrect because 1.0550% is the yield per quarter.
   B is incorrect because 2.1100% is the yield per quarter (1.0550%) multiplied by 2.

2. A is correct. The G-spread is a yield spread above that of a government bond with
   the same maturity date. The yield-to-maturity for the corporate bond is 2.7070%.
   The yield-to-maturity for the government benchmark bond is 1.9036%.
   G-spread = 2.707% – 1.904% = 0.8034% = 80.3 bps.
   B is incorrect because 87 bps is the I-spread calculated as the yield spread of a
   bond over the standard swap rate in the same currency and with the same tenor.
   C is incorrect because 135 bps is the spread calculated as the difference between
   the yield-to-maturity of the QWE bond and the average of government rates for
   all maturities.

3. C is correct. The I-spread is the yield spread of a bond over the standard swap
   rate in the same currency and with the same tenor. The yield-to-maturity for the
   corporate bond is 2.707%, and the swap rate for the same maturity is 1.840%.
   I-spread = 2.707% – 1.840% = 0.867% = 87 bps.
   A is incorrect because 46 bps is the difference between the bond’s
   yield-to-maturity and coupon rate.
   2.707% – 2.250% = 0.457% = 46 bps.
   B is incorrect because 80 bps is the G-spread—the yield-to-maturity for the cor-
   porate bond less the yield-to-maturity for the government benchmark bond.
   G-spread = 2.707% – 1.904% = 80 bps.

4. B is correct. To calculate the Z-spread, we must solve for Z in the following equa-
   tion, given the spot rates and price of the bond:
                                                              PMT + FV
   	​PV = _
          ​ PMT 1 ​+ _        ​ PMT ​+ ⋯ + _     ​                ​.​

                              The Solver add-in for Microsoft Excel finds Z = 0.0082, or 82 bps, by setting the
                              price (sum of present values of cash flows) equal to 98.70 as the objective and Z
                              as the change variable. Please refer to the candidate learning ecosystem online
                              for a spreadsheet demonstrating the calculation in the downloadable Excel
                              workbook.
                              A is incorrect because 80 bps is the value of the G-spread, not the Z-spread. The
                              G-spread is calculated as the difference between the QWE bond yield and the
                              yield of the government bond with the same maturity:
                              G-spread = 2.707% – 1.904% = 80 bps.
                              C is incorrect because 87 bps is the I-spread, not the Z-spread. The I-spread is
                              calculated as a yield spread of a bond over the standard swap rate in the same
                              currency and with the same tenor. The yield-to-maturity for the corporate bond
                              is 2.707%, and the swap rate for the same maturity is 1.840%.
                              I-spread = 2.707% – 1.840% = 87 bps.

INTRODUCTION
Prior lessons covered pricing, yields, and spreads for bonds with fixed coupon rates and
                                                                                           1
times-to-maturity of one year or longer. The next two lessons broaden the discussion
to include instruments with variable rather than fixed coupons, known as floating-rate
instruments, and those with original maturities of one year or less, known as money
market instruments. Both types of instrument are important for investors and issuers.
Floating-rate instruments, by adjusting cash flows to changes in interest rates, bear
less price risk than fixed-rate instruments and are used to hedge certain exposures
and to match asset and liability cash flows. Most loans are floating-rate instruments.
Money market instruments are a significant source of short-term financing for many
types of issuers. A short time-to-maturity means that investors can reinvest and issuers
can refinance relatively quickly, which reduces interest rate risk.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   A floating-rate instrument is a debt instrument with interest
          determined by an observed market reference rate (MRR) plus
          a quoted margin. Interest payments are reset, capturing any change in
          the MRR, on predetermined dates.
      ■   The quoted margin is a specified spread over or under the reference
          rate. The required margin, also known as the discount margin, is the
          spread required by investors.

                                 ■   The required margin reflects “bottom-up” or issuer- and security-spe-
                                     cific risks and is analogous to a yield spread for a fixed-rate bond
                                     discussed in prior lessons. If a floater trades at par, the quoted and
                                     required margins are equal.
                                 ■   Money market instruments have original maturities of one year or less
                                     and are quoted using different conventions from those of longer-dated
                                     securities. Quotes are made on a discount rate or add-on rate basis.
                                 ■   Money market discount rates are interest income divided by the face
                                     value (maturity value). They understate the investor’s rate of return if
                                     the purchase price is below the face value and vice versa.
                                 ■   Conventional money market measures can be converted to enhance
                                     comparability to longer-term securities.

                             These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                             of understanding of the learning module.

                             1. The following information relates to three floating-rate notes (FRNs) issued
                                at par value that have the three-month MRR as their reference rate.
                                                                      ​

                              FRN 1                            140 bps                      128 bps
                              FRN 2                            145 bps                      145 bps
                              FRN 3                            150 bps                      165 bps
                                                                      ​




                                Based on the information provided, identify which FRN will be priced at a
                                discount on the next reset date.
                                 A. FRN 1
                                 B. FRN 2
                                 C. FRN 3
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. FRN 3 will be priced at a discount on the next reset date since
                                its quoted margin of 150 bps is less than its discount margin of 165 bps. The
                                discount amount is the present value of the deficient future interest pay-
                                ments of 15 bps per quarter (150 bps – 165 bps).
                                B is incorrect because FRN 2 will be priced at par value on the next reset
                                date since its quoted margin is equal to its discount margin.
                                A is incorrect because FRN 1 will be priced at a premium because its quoted
                                margin of 140 bps is greater than its discount margin of 128 bps. The premi-
                                um amount is the present value of the extra, or “excess,” interest payments of
                                12 bps each quarter (140 bps – 128 bps).

                             2. On a reset date, if the required margin falls to 30 bps because of a change
                                in the issuer’s credit risk, an FRN that has a quoted margin of 50 bps will be
                                priced at a:
                                 A. discount.
                                 B. premium.

Introduction                                                                            187


      C. discount or premium, depending on its duration.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The required margin reflects the credit risk of the issuer. It de-
     clined, meaning that the credit risk of the issuer improved; in other words,
     the market demands a lower spread. The required margin is below the quot-
     ed margin, so this floater will be priced at a premium.

  3. A 365-day year bank certificate of deposit has an initial principal amount of
     USD96.5 million and a redemption amount due at maturity of USD100 mil-
     lion. The number of days between settlement and maturity is 270. The add-
     on rate of the certificate of deposit is closest to:
      A. 3.63%.
      B. 4.82%.
      C. 4.90%.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The add-on rate is closest to 4.90%. The add-on rate is calculat-
     ed as
                       FV − PV
      AOR = _    ​× _

     ​
     AOR = 0.04903 = 4.90 % .
  4. A 90-day commercial paper instrument is quoted at a discount rate of
     0.120%, assuming a 360-day year. Given that the price of the instrument is
     paid 100 per face value, its bond equivalent yield rate is closest to:
      A. 0.107%.
      B. 0.120%.
      C. 0.135%.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The bond equivalent yield is closest to 0.120%. First, we need to
     calculate the price of the instrument. Then, we can calculate the AOR or its
     bond equivalent yield.
     The price (PV) of the commercial paper instrument is
                         Days
      PV = FV × (1 − _

     ​
     PV = 99.97.
     PV is used to calculate the add-on rate or bond equivalent yield:

      AOR = _    ​× _

188   Learning Module 8                             Yield and Yield Spread Measures for Floating-Rate Instruments


                             5. A fixed-income analyst is evaluating two instruments:

                                 ■   A 180-day Thai bank certificate of deposit (CD) quoted at a discount
                                     rate of 5.95%, assuming a 360-day year and a bond equivalent yield of
                                     6.218%
                                 ■   A 180-day Thai corporate commercial paper (CP) quoted as an add-on
                                     rate of 6.10%, assuming a 365-day year and a bond equivalent yield of
                                     6.100%.


                                Assuming the six-month Thai T-bill is quoted at 4.36%, which instrument
                                most likely has higher credit risk?
                                Solution:
                                The Thai CD. The spreads over the Thai T-bill for the CD and CP are 186
                                bps and 174 bps, respectively. We use the bond equivalent yield measure to
                                compare the return of each instrument and derive the spread of each one
                                over the Thai T-bill.
                                The Thai bank CD has a spread of
                                 6.218% – 4.36% = 186 bps.
                                And the Thai corporate CP has a spread of
                                 6.10% – 4.36% = 174 bps.
                                Therefore, the Thai bank CD has a higher credit risk than the Thai corporate
                                CP.




              2           YIELD AND YIELD SPREAD MEASURES FOR
                          FLOATING-RATE NOTES

                                        calculate and interpret yield spread measures for floating-rate
                                        instruments



                          Yield and Yield Spread Measures for Floating-Rate Instruments
                          Floating-rate instruments, including floating-rate notes (FRNs or floaters) and most
                          loans, are different from fixed-rate bonds. Rather than fixed coupon payments, they
                          vary from period to period depending on the current level of a reference interest rate.
                          The intent is to both automatically adjust a borrower’s base rate to market conditions
                          and offer an investor or lender less price risk when market interest rates fluctuate. In
                          principle, a floater has a stable price even in a period of volatile interest rates because
                          cash flows adjust with changes in interest rates. With a traditional fixed-income security,
                          constant future cash flows result in price changes in response to interest rate volatility.
                              Exhibit 1 shows the term sheet for four-year FRNs issued by Antelas AG, the
                          German emerging technology company focused on manufacturing process design,

Business Days:            Frankfurt

Notice how the interest is stated “MRR plus 250 bps p.a.” The market reference rate
(MRR) on an FRN or loan usually is a short-term money market rate. Typically, the
reference rate is determined at the beginning of the period, and the interest payment
is made at the end of the period. This payment structure is called “in arrears.” The
most common day-count conventions for calculating accrued interest on floaters
are actual/360 and actual/365. For the Antelas FRN, the MRR is reset quarterly and
interest is paid quarterly.
     For most FRNs and loans, a specified spread is added to or subtracted from the
market reference rate. For the Antelas FRN, the spread over the MRR is 250 bps, and
this is known as the quoted margin on the FRN. The role of the quoted margin is
to compensate the investor for the difference in the credit risk of the issuer and that
implied by the reference rate. Firms with very low credit risk may be able to obtain
a negative quoted margin.
     The required margin is the yield spread over or under the reference rate such that
the FRN is priced at par value on a rate reset date. It is determined by the market.
Suppose that a floater is issued at par value and pays MRR plus 0.50%. The quoted
margin is 50 bps. If there is no change in the credit risk of the issuer, the required
margin remains at 50 bps. On each quarterly reset date, the floater will be priced at
par value. Between coupon dates, its flat price will be at a premium or discount to
par value if MRR goes, respectively, down or up. However, if the required margin
continues to be the same as the quoted margin, the flat price is “pulled to par” as the
next reset date nears. At the reset date, any change in MRR is included in the interest
payment for the next period.
     Changes in the required margin usually come from changes in the issuer’s credit
risk. Changes in liquidity or tax status can also affect the required margin. Note that
these are the same factors that affect the yield spread for fixed-rate bonds. Suppose
that on a reset date, the required margin increases to 75 bps because of a downgrade
in the issuer’s credit rating. If the quoted margin is 50 bps, the issuer now pays its
investors a “deficient” interest payment. This FRN will be priced at a discount below
par value. The amount of the discount is the present value of the deficient future cash
flows. That annuity is 25 bps per period for the remaining life of the bond. It is the
difference between the required and quoted margins. If the required margin instead
fell to 40 bps, perhaps from a decrease in the issuer’s credit risk, the FRN would be
priced at a premium. The amount of the premium is the present value of the 10 bp
annuity for the “excess” interest payment each period.

                              Fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds are essentially the same with respect to changes
                          in credit risk. With fixed-rate bonds, the premium or discount arises from a difference
                          in the fixed coupon rate and the required yield-to-maturity. With floating-rate bonds,
                          the premium or discount arises from a difference in the fixed quoted margin and the
                          required margin. However, fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds are very different with
                          respect to changes in benchmark interest rates.
                              The valuation of a floating-rate note requires a pricing model. Recall that the price
                          for a fixed-rate bond given a market discount rate r and a coupon per period PMT is
                                                                          PMT + FV

                          For an FRN, PMT is a function of the MRR and the quoted margin and r is a function
                          of the MRR and the discount margin. We can use this intuition to derive Equation 1,

                              MRR = the market reference rate, stated as an annual percentage rate (it is some-
                                    times known generically as Index)

                               QM = the quoted margin, stated as an annual percentage rate

                                FV = the future value paid at maturity, or the par value of the bond

                                  m = the periodicity of the floating-rate note, the number of payment periods
                                      per year

                               DM = the discount margin = required margin stated as an annual percentage rate

                                  N = the number of evenly spaced periods to maturity
                               Notice that in Equation 1, because we are using annual rates for MRR, QM, and
                          DM, we must divide by m periods in the year.
                               This is a simplified model for several reasons. First, PV is as of a rate reset date
                          when there are N evenly spaced periods to maturity. There is no accrued interest, so the
                          flat price is the full price. Second, the model assumes a 30/360 day-count convention,
                          to make sure the periodicity, m, is an integer. However, in practice, most floaters use
                          actual/360 day counts. Third, and most important, the same MRR is used for all cash
                          flows. More complex FRN pricing models use projected future rates in the numerators
                          and spot rates in the denominators. Therefore, the calculation for DM depends on the
                          simplifying assumptions in the pricing model.
                               Suppose that we are pricing a two-year, semi-annual FRN that pays MRR plus
                          0.50%. Assume MRR is 1.25% and the yield spread required by investors is 40 bps.
                          For Equation 1, we have the following inputs:

                              MRR = 0.0125,

                               QM = 0.0050,

                                FV = 100,

                                  m = 2,

                               DM = 0.0040, and

                                  N = 4.

    Using Equation 1 for N = 4, the FRN is priced at 100.196 per 100 of par value. This
floater is priced at a premium above par value because the quoted margin is greater
than the discount margin.

   PV = 100.196
If we have the market price of an FRN, we can also use Equation 1 to estimate the
discount margin. Suppose that a two-year FRN pays MRR plus 0.75% on a semiannual
basis. Currently, MRR is 1.10% and the price of the floater is 95.50 per 100 of par
value, a discount to par, because of worsening credit risk. For Equation 1, we have
the following inputs:

     PV = 95.50,

   MRR = 0.0110,

     QM = 0.0075,

     FV = 100,

       m = 2, and

       N = 4.
    Using the Solver add-in for Microsoft Excel, we find DM = 3.12%, or 312 bps, by
setting the price (sum of present values of cash flows) equal to 95.50 as the objective
and DM as the change variable. Please see the candidate learning ecosystem online
for a spreadsheet demonstrating the calculation in the downloadable Excel workbook.
    If this FRN was issued at par value, investors required at that time a spread of only
75 bps over MRR. Now, after the credit downgrade, investors require an estimated
discount margin of 312 bps. The floater trades at a discount because the quoted margin
remains fixed at 75 bps, so is “deficient” by 237 bps (312-75) per period The discount
margin is an estimate because it is based on a simplified FRN pricing model.
    The FRN pricing model in Equation 1 similarly applies to adjustable-rate loans
made by banks and other fixed-income instruments based on MRR. Because a signifi-
cant portion of bank funding comes from short-term deposits and other floating-rate
sources, banks prefer to make floating-rate loans to businesses and individuals, as
opposed to fixed-rate loans, to help maintain a match between assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet.

EXAMPLE 1

   Calculating the Discount Margin for a Floating-Rate Note
   Suppose that the MRR for the Antelas AG four-year floating-rate note is on a
   three-month basis and the quoted margin is 250 bps. The floater is priced at 97
   per 100 of par value. Calculate the discount margin for the floater assuming that
   three-month MRR is constant at –0.55%. Assume a 30/360 day-count convention
   and evenly spaced periods.

                                The __________ (shorter, longer) the reset period, the more a floater will be-
                                have similarly to a short-dated fixed-rate security and the __________ (less,
                                more) its price will potentially fluctuate.
                                Solution:
                                Floaters with longer reset periods may be more exposed to interest rate and
                                price volatility. The longer the reset period, the more a floater will behave
                                similarly to a short-dated fixed-rate security and the more its price will
                                potentially fluctuate.

                             2. For a five-year floating-rate security, if market interest rates change by 0.5%,
                                the change in the price of the security will most likely be:
                                 A. zero.
                                 B. like an otherwise identical fixed-rate security.
                                 C. related to the security’s coupon reset frequency.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. The interest rate sensitivity of a floating-rate security comes
                                typically from the time remaining until its next coupon reset date.

     A is incorrect: when the interest rates changes, the discount rate of the
     floating rate security also changes, changing the present value of the security
     when discounting the cashflows.
     B is incorrect: with a fixed-rate security, interest rates changes affect the
     price more than an identical (same-term) floating-rate security, due to its
     fixed coupon payments and a higher duration.

  3. Identify the relationship between required margin and a floater’s price at the
     reset date:
                                             ​




    1. Required margin > Quoted
                                          A. Floater priced at par
    margin
    2. Required margin = Quoted
                                          B. Floater priced at a discount
    margin
    3. Required margin < Quoted
                                          C. Floater priced at a premium
    margin
                                             ​




     Solution:
                                             ​




    1. Required margin > Quoted
                                          B. Floater priced at a discount
    margin
    2. Required margin = Quoted
                                          A. Floater priced at par
    margin
    3. Required margin < Quoted
                                          C. Floater priced at a premium
    margin
                                             ​




     For Required margin > Quoted margin, B is correct. Changes in the required
     margin usually come from changes in the issuer’s credit risk. If the required
     margin increases and is above the quoted margin at the reset date, the float-
     er pays a “deficient” interest payment. The floater will be priced at a discount
     below par value.
     For Required margin = Quoted margin, A is correct. If the required margin
     continues to be the same as the quoted margin, the flat price is “pulled to
     par” as the next reset date nears.
     For Required margin < Quoted margin, C is correct. If the required margin
     decreases and is below the quoted margin, the floater will be priced at a
     premium.

  4. A two-year Italian floating-rate note pays three-month Euribor of –0.50%
     plus 250 bp. The floater is priced at 99 per 100 of par value. Assuming the
     30/360 day-count convention and evenly spaced periods, the discount mar-
     gin for the floater is closest to:
      A. 201 bps.
      B. 251 bps.
      C. 300 bps.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The discount margin for the floater is closest to 300 bps. Using
     the information provided, the periodic PMT is equal to
      (MRR + QM ) × FV

              3           YIELD MEASURES FOR MONEY MARKET
                          INSTRUMENTS

                                         calculate and interpret yield measures for money market instruments

                          Money market instruments are debt securities with original maturities of one year
                          or less. There are many types, including overnight sale and repurchase agreements
                          (repos), bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, Treasury bills (government
                          securities issued with a maturity of one year or less), bankers’ acceptances, and time
                          deposits based on market reference rates. There are mutual funds that invest solely
                          in eligible money market securities, known as money market mutual funds, which
                          are sometimes considered as an alternative to bank deposits.
                              There are several important differences in yield measures quoted for money market
                          instruments versus bonds:
                              1. Bond yields-to-maturity are annualized and compounded. Yield measures
                                 in the money market are annualized but not compounded; the return on a
                                 money market instrument is stated on a simple interest basis.

   2. Bond yields-to-maturity usually are stated for a common periodicity for all
      times-to-maturity. Money market instruments with different times-to-matu-
      rity have different periodicities for the annual rate.
   3. Bond yields-to-maturity can be calculated using standard time-value-
      of-money analysis. Money market instruments are often quoted using
      non-standard interest rates and require different pricing equations than
      those used for bonds.
    In general, quoted money market rates are either discount rates or add-on rates.
Although market conventions vary around the world, commercial paper, Treasury
bills, and bankers’ acceptances often are quoted on a discount rate basis. Bank certif-
icates of deposit, repos, and market reference rate indexes are quoted on an add-on
rate basis. While discount rate usually means “interest rate used to calculate a pres-
ent value,” in the money market, the discount rate involves an instrument for which
interest is included in the face value of the instrument. An add-on rate, in contrast,
involves interest that is added to the principal or investment amount. Some examples
will clarify this point.
    Equation 2 is the pricing formula for money market instruments quoted on a
discount rate basis.
                      Days
   	​PV = FV × (1 − _
                    ​Year ​× DR ) ,​	                                              (2)

   where

     PV = present value, or the price of the money market instrument

     FV = the future value paid at maturity, or the face value of the money market
          instrument

   Days = the number of days between settlement and maturity

    Year = the number of days in the year

     DR = the discount rate, stated as an annual percentage rate
    Suppose that a 91-day Indian Treasury bill (T-bill) with a face value of INR10
million is quoted at a discount rate of 3.45% for an assumed 360-day year. The price
of the Indian rupee T-bill is INR9,912,792.
                      Days
   	​PV = FV × (1 − _
                    ​Year ​× DR ) .​

                                 91
   	​PV = 10, 000, 000 × (1 − _
                              ​360 ​× 0.0345 ) .​

   	​PV = 9, 912, 791.67.​
The unique characteristics of a money market discount rate can be examined with
Equation 3, which transforms Equation 2 algebraically to isolate the DR term.
           Year    (FV − PV)
   	​DR = _
          ​Days ​× _
                   ​ FV ​.​	                                                       (3)

The first term, Year/Days, is the periodicity of the annual rate. The second term reveals
the odd character of a money market discount rate. The numerator, FV – PV, is the
interest earned on the rupee T-bill, INR87,208 (= 10,000,000 – 9,912,792), over the 91
days to maturity. However, the denominator is FV, not PV. In theory, an interest rate
is the amount earned divided by the investment amount (PV), not the maturity value
(FV), which includes the earnings. Therefore, by design, a money market discount rate
understates the rate of return to the investor, and it understates the cost of borrowed
funds to the issuer. That is because PV is less than FV if DR is greater than zero.

                             Yield Measures on Bank Certificates of Deposit
                             Commercial Finance Partners AG (CFP Bank) issues 90-day certificates of
                             deposit (CDs) to fund its floating-rate loans made to customers. The objective
                             is to maintain a match between the bank’s assets (floating-rate loans) and its
                             funding sources. The quoted add-on rate for its 90-day CD is 0.12%, assuming
                             a 365-day year. If the initial principal amount is EUR20 million, the redemption
                             amount due at maturity is found by rearranging Equation 4 and entering PV =
                             20,000,000, Days = 90, Year = 365, and AOR = 0.0012.
                                                                         90
                                 	​FV = 20, 000, 000 + (20, 000, 000 × _
                                                                       ​365 ​× 0.0012 ) .​

                                 	​FV = 20,005,918.​
                                 At maturity, CFP Bank pays EUR20,005,918, the principal of EUR20,000,000
                             plus interest of EUR5,918. The interest is calculated as the principal times the
                             fraction of the year times the annual add-on rate. It is added to the principal to
                             determine the redemption amount.
                                 Suppose that after 45 days, the CD investor sells the CD to a dealer. At that
                             time, the quoted add-on rate for a 45-day CD is 0.06%. The sale price for the

      The rate of return, stated on a 365-day add-on rate basis, is 0.12%. This result
  is an annual rate for a periodicity of 8.11 (= 365/45). Implicitly, this assumes
  that the investment can be replicated 8.11 times over the year.

    Investment analysis is more challenging for money market securities because (1)
some instruments are quoted on a discount rate basis while others on an add-on rate
basis and (2) some assume a 360-day year and others use a 365-day year. Another
difference is that the “amount” of a money market instrument quoted by traders on a
discount rate basis typically is the face value paid at maturity. However, the “amount”
when quoted on an add-on rate basis usually is the price at issuance. Exhibit 2 sum-
marizes these conventions.

on a common basis. The following example illustrates this point.

  Yield Measures on Bank Certificates of Deposit
  Suppose that an investor is comparing the following two money market instru-
  ments. Which offers the higher expected rate of return, assuming that credit
  risks are the same?
      ■    A 90-day commercial paper (CP) issued by Bright Wheel Automotive
           Corporation (BRWA), quoted at a discount rate of 0.100% for a 360-
           day year
      ■    A 90-day certificate of deposit issued by CFP Bank, quoted at an
           add-on rate of 0.120% for a 365-day year
      The price of the commercial paper is 98.560 per 100 of face value, calculated
  using Equation 2 and entering FV = 100, Days = 90, Year = 360, and DR = 0.0012.

                                Next, use Equation 5 to solve for AOR for a 365-day year, where Year = 365,
                             Days = 90, FV = 100, and PV = 99.970.

                                  	​AOR = 0.00122.​
                                 The 90-day commercial paper discount rate of 0.120% converts to an add-on
                             rate for a 365-day year of 0.122%. This converted rate is called a bond equivalent
                             yield, or sometimes just an “investment yield.” A bond equivalent yield is a
                             money market rate stated on a 365-day add-on rate basis. If the risks are the
                             same, BRWA’s CP offers 0.2 bps more in annual return than CFP Bank’s CD.

                          instruments on a common, bond equivalent yield basis.

    Another important difference between yield measures in the money market and
the bond market is the periodicity of the annual rate. Because bond yields-to-maturity
are computed using interest rate compounding, there is a well-defined periodicity. For
instance, bond yields-to-maturity for semiannual compounding are annualized for a
periodicity of two. Money market rates are computed using simple interest without
compounding. In the money market, the periodicity is the number of days in the year
divided by the number of days to maturity. Therefore, money market rates for different
times-to-maturity have different periodicities.
    Suppose that an analyst prefers to convert money market rates to a semiannual
bond basis so that the rates are directly comparable to yields on bonds that make
semiannual coupon payments. The quoted rate for a 91-day Indian rupee T-bill is
3.50%, quoted as a bond equivalent yield, which means its periodicity is 365/91. We
use the periodicity conversion formula covered in a previous lesson to convert from
a periodicity m of 365/91 to n of 2:
                   m                           n
   	​(1 + _
          ​ m ​)​ ​ = (   ​ n )
         AP ​Rm
              ​​                   AP ​Rn​ ​
                      ​ 1+_   ​ ​ ​.​

                    365
                    _
                                     AP ​R​ ​ 2
           365 ​ ​ ​ = (   ​ 2 2 ​)​ ​.​
            0.035 ​91 ​
   (         ​91 ​ )
   	​ 1 + _
          ​_           ​ 1+_


   	​ P ​R2​ ​ = 0.03515 = 3.515 % .​
   A
Therefore, 3.50% for a periodicity of 365/91 corresponds to 3.515% for a periodicity
of 2. The difference is –1.5 bps. In general, the difference depends on the level of the
annual percentage rate. When interest rates are lower, the difference between the
annual rates for any two periodicities is reduced.

                                Solution:
                                A is correct. In the money market, the discount rate is a specific type of
                                quoted rate. Hence, the price or the present value of a money market instru-
                                ment is determined by
                                                      Days
                                 	​PV = FV × (1 − _
                                                  ​Year ​× DR ) ,​

                                where

                              PV = present value, or the price of the money market instrument

                              FV = the future value paid at maturity, or the face value of the money market
                              instrument

                              Days = the number of days between settlement and maturity

                              Year = the number of days in the year

                              DR = the discount rate, stated as an annual percentage rate


                             2. True or false: Yield measures in money market instruments are annualized
                                and compounded.
                                 A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                False. Bond yields-to-maturity are annualized and compounded. However,
                                yield measures in money markets are annualized but not compounded.

                             3. True or false: Money market instruments use the standard time value of
                                money, such as discount rates or add-on rates.
                                 A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                False. Bond yields-to-maturity are calculated using the standard time value
                                of money. Money market instruments are often quoted using non-standard
                                interest rates, such as discount rates or add-on rates.

                             4. True or false: Money market instruments with different times-to-maturity
                                have different periodicities.

      B. False
     Solution:
     True. Money market instruments with different times-to-maturities have
     different periodicities. However, bond yields-to-maturity are given for a
     common periodicity for all times-to-maturity.

  5. Explain the concept of a bond equivalent yield for a money market
     instrument.
     Solution:
     A bond equivalent yield is the rate of return on a money market instrument
     that is calculated with reference to the purchase price of the instrument
     based on a 365-day year. The converted rate or yield can be used to compare
     the return earned on the money market instrument with a similar return
     earned by a bond.

      A. Short-term Thai T-bills
      B. Thai bank certificate of deposit

   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct.
   The estimated discount margin is 195 bps. Using the information provided, the
   periodic PMT is equal to
   (MRR + QM ) × FV
   ______________               (− 0.0055 + 0.016 ) × 100
   	​
         m        ​ = __________________
                        
                      ​        4         ​ = 0.275.​
   Using the RATE function in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or a financial calcu-
   lator and using PV = –101.20, FV = 100, PMT =0.275, and N = 8, we solve for the
   discount rate per period of 12.4161%. The discount margin can then be estimated
   by solving for DM:

         ​MRRm+ DM ​.​
   	​r = _

                    − 0.005 + DM
   	​0.124161 = _
                ​ 4 ​.​

   	​ M = 0.502144.​
   D
   The estimated discount margin is 50.2 bps.

2. B is correct. The required margin is the yield spread over or under a reference
   rate, reflecting the credit risk of an issuer. Changes in the required margin typi-
   cally come from a change in the issuer’s credit risk.
   A and C are incorrect. Both risks, as “top-down” or macroeconomic risks, would
   be reflected in changes in the MRR, not in a spread such as the required margin.

3. B is correct. This FRN is priced at a discount, because the quoted margin is less
   than the discount (required) margin.

4. B is correct. The FRN is priced at 99.804 per 100 of par value. Using the informa-
   tion provided, the periodic PMT is equal to
   (MRR + QM ) × FV
   ______________               (0.025 + 0.008 ) × 100
   	​
         m        ​ = ________________
                        
                      ​       4        ​ = 0.825.​
   The assumed discount rate per period is equal to 0.875%.

         ​MRRm+ DM ​.​
   	​r = _

        0.025 + 0.01
   	​r = _
         ​ 4 ​.​

   r	​ = 0.00875.​

                              The denominator for the second term is FV, not PV. In theory, an interest rate is
                              the amount earned divided by the investment amount (PV), not the maturity val-
                              ue (FV), which includes the earnings. So long as DR is greater than zero, FV will
                              be higher than PV. Therefore, by design, a money market discount rate under-
                              states the rate of return to the investor, and it understates the cost of borrowed
                              funds to the issuer.

INTRODUCTION
Prior lessons priced fixed-income instruments by discounting all future cash flows
                                                                                            1
using a single interest rate, such as the yield-to-maturity or a market reference rate
(MRR) plus a discount margin. The next three lessons relax this assumption by intro-
ducing the term structure of interest rates, or the fact that interest rates vary with
time-to-maturity. The ideal data to use for term structure analysis are default-risk-free
zero-coupon bonds, known as spot rates or the spot curve. Since these are generally
not directly observable, various estimation techniques are used. The spot curve is used
to derive two other important yield curves: the par curve and the forward curve. A
par curve involves bond yields for hypothetical benchmark securities priced at par,
while the forward curve involves rates for interest periods starting in the future. All
three of these curves are fundamental to fixed-income analysis and other applications
because they represent default-risk-free rates of return for time periods that start
today and in the future. We show the pricing of bonds using these different rates and
establish their relationships.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Spot rates are market discount rates on default-risk-free
           zero-coupon bonds, sometimes referred to as zero rates. By
           using a sequence of spot rates in calculating bond prices, a no-arbi-
           trage bond price is obtained.

208   Learning Module 9                         The Term Structure of Interest Rates: Spot, Par, and Forward Curves


                                 ■    A par rate is the market discount rate for a specific maturity that
                                      would result in a bond priced at par. A par rate is derived from the
                                      spot rates up to and including the maturity date.
                                 ■    Implied forward rates are calculated using spot rates and can be
                                      interpreted as an incremental, or marginal, return for extending the
                                      time-to-maturity for an additional time period. As such, they reflect a
                                      breakeven reinvestment rate.
                                 ■    Since par and forward rates can be derived from spot rates, the shape
                                      of the spot curve is closely related to the shape of the par and forward
                                      curves.
                                 ■    In upward-sloping term structures, par rates will be lower than their
                                      corresponding spot rates and forward rates will be greater than spot
                                      rates. In downward-sloping term structures, par rates will be greater
                                      than spot rates and forward rates will be lower than spot rates.

                             2. Define what a par rate represents in the context of bond pricing.
                                Solution:
                                The par rate is the yield-to-maturity that makes the present value of a bond’s
                                cash flows (i.e., its price) equal to its par or face value.

        2-year                                                        1.5%
        3-year                                                        2.0%
                                           ​




     Solution:
      (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B − A = (1 + ZB)B.

      (1 + 0.01)1 × (1 + IFR2,1)2 = (1 + 0.02)3.

      IFR2,1 = 3.01%.


  4. Explain the economic meaning of the forward rate result calculated in Ques-
     tion 3.
     Solution:
     The one-year forward rate two years from now (2y1y) of 3.01% implies that
     investors expect the one-year interest rate to be 3.01% at the end of two
     years. This reflects the rate at which reinvestment would yield the same
     results over a three-year horizon regardless of whether the investor initially
     bought a two-year bond versus a three-year bond.

  5. Contrast spot and forward rates.
     Solution:
     Spot rates reflect borrowing and investing rates for funds immediately (or in
     the next few days) over the specified tenor, while forward rates reflect rates
     applicable to agreements to borrow or invest beginning on a future date for
     a specified tenor.

  6. True or false: One-year forward rates are higher compared to their corre-
     sponding spot rates when the spot rate curve is downward sloping.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     False. When the spot curve is downward sloping, the one-year forward
     rate curve will lie below the spot rate curve. Declining spot rates for longer
     maturities imply that investors should expect lower rates of reinvestment in

210   Learning Module 9                         The Term Structure of Interest Rates: Spot, Par, and Forward Curves



                          Maturity Structure of Interest Rates
                          Suppose that the yield-to-maturity is higher on one bond compared to another bond.
                          There are several possible reasons for the difference, including credit risk, different
                          currencies, liquidity, tax differences, and the periodicity assumption used in the yield
                          calculation. Credit risk and currency differences were demonstrated in earlier lessons
                          where Romania’s (Ministry of Finance) 30-year euro-denominated bonds were issued
                          at a 4.657% yield-to-maturity, a 411 bp spread over Federal Republic of Germany
                          bonds. Another reason bonds may have different yields-to-maturity is that they have
                          different times-to-maturity. This factor explaining the differences in yields is called
                          the maturity structure of interest rates or term structure of interest rates.
                              Term structure is best analyzed using bonds that have all the same properties other
                          than time-to-maturity; that is, the bonds should be denominated in the same currency
                          and have the same credit risk, liquidity, tax status, and periodicity assumption and
                          they should have the same coupon rate so that they each have the same degree of
                          coupon reinvestment risk. This ideal dataset would be yields-to-maturity on a series
                          of default-risk-free zero-coupon bonds, known as spot rates, for a full range of matur-
                          ities. Developed market sovereign bonds are typically used for this purpose, because
                          they represent the lowest default risk among issuers in a given market. Collectively,
                          this dataset is the government bond spot curve, sometimes called the zero or “strip”
                          curve (because the coupon payments are “stripped” off the bonds).
                              The government bond spot curve is ideal for analyzing maturity structure because
                          it best meets the “other things being equal” assumption. These government bonds
                          presumably have the same currency, credit risk, liquidity, and tax status. Most impor-
                          tantly, as zero-coupon bonds, they have no coupon reinvestment risk. A government
                          bond spot curve is illustrated in Exhibit 1 for maturities ranging from 1 to 30 years.
                          The annual yields are stated on a semiannual bond basis, which facilitates comparison
                          to coupon-bearing bonds that make semiannual payments, like corporate bonds in
                          many markets.

Maturity Structure of Interest Rates and Spot Rates                                         211


The spot curve in Exhibit 1 is upward sloping and flattens for longer times-to-maturity,
meaning that the longer-term government bonds have higher yields than the shorter-term
bonds. This pattern is typical under normal market conditions. Sometimes, a spot
curve is downward sloping in that shorter-term yields are higher than longer-term
yields. Such downward-sloping spot curves are called inverted yield curves. Theories
that attempt to explain the shape of the yield curve and its implications for future
financial market conditions are covered later.
    While a spot curve comprised of zero-coupon government bonds is ideal for
analysis, there are several practical issues to contend with. First, most actively traded
government bonds make coupon payments. These coupon bonds might not have the
same liquidity and tax status. Older (“seasoned”) bonds tend to be less liquid than
newly issued debt because they are owned by “buy-and-hold” institutional and retail
investors. Governments issue new debt for regular times-to-maturity—for instance,
5-year and 10-year bonds. The current 6-year bond could be a 10-year bond that was
issued four years ago. Also, because interest rates fluctuate, older bonds can be priced
at a discount or premium to par value, which can lead to tax differences because some
tax jurisdictions distinguish capital gains and losses from interest income.
    In practice, therefore, only the most recently issued and actively traded govern-
ment bonds are used to build a yield curve. These bonds have similar liquidity, and
because they are priced closer to par value, they have fewer tax effects. Additionally,
because there are limited data for the full range of maturities, interpolation is used
to complete the curve. Exhibit 2 illustrates a yield curve for a government that issues
2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, and 30-year bonds that make semiannual coupon
payments. Straight-line interpolation is used between those points on the yield curve.

                          Exhibit 2 also includes yields for short-term government securities having 1 month,
                          3 months, 6 months, and 12 months to maturity. Although these money market
                          instruments are issued and traded on a discount rate basis, they are converted to bond
                          equivalent yields (i.e., add-on rates with a 365-day year). All bonds on the yield curve
                          should also be converted to the same periodicity in order to facilitate comparisons
                          across times-to-maturity. Conversion from discount rates to bond equivalent yields
                          and across periodicities was demonstrated in prior lessons.


                          Bond Pricing Using Spot Rates
                          Since interest rates vary by maturity and have a term structure, we can price bonds
                          using a sequence of discount rates that correspond to the cash flow dates. One such
                          sequence, representing default-risk-free rates, is the spot curve. Bond prices deter-
                          mined using spot rates establish “no-arbitrage” prices; if a bond’s price differs from its
                          no-arbitrage value, an arbitrage opportunity exists in the absence of transaction costs.

Maturity Structure of Interest Rates and Spot Rates                                        213


    Suppose that the one-year spot rate is 2%, the two-year spot rate is 3%, and the
three-year spot rate is 4%. Then, the price of a three-year bond that makes a 5% annual
coupon payment is 102.960:
   _      5          5         105
   	​ (        ​+ _
                  ​       ​+ _

      ​ 1.02)​1​ ​(1.03)​2​ ​(1.04)​3​

   4.902 + 4.713 + 93.345 = 102.960.
    This three-year bond is priced at a premium, so its yield-to-maturity must be less
than its 5% coupon rate. Using the basic bond pricing formula, the yield-to-maturity
is 3.935%:
                       5            5            105
   	​102.960 = _

                     ​+ _
                        ​( )2
                              ​+ _
                                 ​( )3
                                       ​; r = 0.03935.​
                    ​1 + r ​ ​   ​1 + r ​ ​    ​1 + r ​ ​
   If the cash flows are discounted using the yield-to-maturity, the same price is
obtained:

                            ​=​
   ​ 1.03935 ​ ​
     (              ​ 1.03935 ​ ​     ​ 1.03935 ​ ​

   4.811 + 4.629 + 93.520 = 102.960.
Notice that the present values of the individual cash flows discounted using spot rates
differ from those discounted using the yield-to-maturity. The present value of the first
coupon payment is 4.902 when discounted at 2%, but it is 4.811 when discounted at
3.935%. The present value of the final cash flow, which includes the redemption of
principal, is 93.345 at 4% and 93.520 at 3.935%. Nevertheless, the sum of the present
values using either approach is 102.960.
    Equation 1 is a general formula for calculating a bond price given the sequence
of spot rates. Note that for pricing a bond with a different risk profile than the spot
curve (such as credit risk, as for corporate bonds, for example), a spread would have
to be added to the spot rates.

   We’ll use spot rates on Canadian and Australian government bonds to demonstrate

  3. Calculate the YTM of the five-year Canadian government bond, using the
     price obtained in Question 1.
     Solution:
     1.104%. Instead of solving for the price, we use Equation 1 to solve for the
     YTM, the IRR that equates the price computed in Question 1 with the
     present value of future cash flows. In Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, the
     RATE or IRR function can be used to solve for r.

QUESTION SET


  1. True or false: In practice, a spot curve is created by calculating the
     yields-to-maturity on recently issued coupon-paying government bonds of
     varying maturities.
      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     True. While zero-coupon government risk-free bonds would be preferable,
     in practice, the spot curve is created using yields on recently issued cou-
     pon-paying government bonds and linear interpolation. These bonds best
     satisfy the conditions for term structure analysis.

  2. Determine the missing word in the following sentence: Because there are
     usually limited data to calculate yields for the full range of maturities, it is
     usually necessary to __________ between observed yields to complete curve
     data.
     Solution:
     Because there are usually limited data to calculate yields for the full range of
     maturities, it is usually necessary to interpolate between observed yields to
     complete curve data.

  3. Calculate the price and yield-to-maturity of a 2.5% coupon, five-year bond
     given the following spot rates. Assume annual compounding.

                             5. Example 1 includes a question for a 0.50% coupon, three-year Canadian
                                government bond, in which the bond’s price is the same as the 99.126 price
                                in Question 4 above. Contrast the Canadian spot curves in Example 1 and
                                Question 4 and explain why these two different yield curves produced the
                                same pricing result.
                                Solution:
                                Example 1 has an upward-sloping term structure, while in Question 4,
                                the term structure is downward sloping. An important similarity is that,
                                despite the vast difference in starting points (i.e., the one-year spot rates)

      between the two examples, the three-year spot rates are similar. In Example
      1, the three-year rate is 0.7977%, and the three-year rate in Question 4 is
      0.7951%. As a result of the similarity of the spot rates in the upward- and
      downward-sloping term structure examples, it is possible to exhibit the
      same price (and YTM) in upward- and downward-sloping term structure
      environments.




PAR AND FORWARD RATES

                 define par and forward rates, and calculate par rates, forward rates
                 from spot rates, spot rates from forward rates, and the price of a
                 bond using forward rates



Par Rates from Spot Rates
An important use of spot rates is determining par rates. A par rate is a yield-to-maturity
that makes the present value of a bond’s cash flows equal to par (100% of face value).
Par rates derived for hypothetical government bonds with different times-to-maturity
are commonly used for term structure analysis because they control for tax, trading,
and other potential distortions associated with actual bonds priced at either a discount
or premium. The widely cited US Treasury yield curve published each day by the US
Department of the Treasury, for example, is composed of par rates. The most recently
issued or on-the-run government securities introduced in an earlier lesson, however,
are actual bonds whose yields-to-maturity are close to but not equal to par rates.
    On a coupon payment date, the following equation can be used to calculate a par
rate by solving for PMT given a sequence of spot rates Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn. Between coupon
dates, we set the flat price, rather than the full price, equal to 100.
                                                   PMT + 100
   	​100 = _
           ​ PMT 1 ​+ _    ​ PMT ​+ ⋯ + _  ​                  ​.​	                    (2)
           ​(1 + ​z​1​)​ ​ ​(1 + ​z​2​)​2​   ​(1 + z​ ​N​)​N​

    This equation is very similar to Equation 1, except PV = FV = 100. Recall that for
a bond to trade at par, its coupon rate and yield-to-maturity must be equal. So, by
solving for PMT, we also solve for the yield-to-maturity for the bond to trade at par.
This single rate, divided by 100, is the par rate per period.
    An example illustrates the calculation of par rates given spot rates. Suppose the
current one-, two-, three-, and four- year spot rates on government bonds are 5.263%,
5.616%, 6.359%, and 7.008%, respectively. These are effective annual rates.
    The one-year par rate is 5.263%:

                          We can confirm that these are the par rates through the pricing formula. Using these
                          par rates as the coupon and yield-to-maturity, the price of the two-year bond is 100:
                              5.606/(1.05606)1 + 105.606/(1.05606)2 = 100.
                          Likewise, the price of the four-year bond is also 100:
                              6.899/(1.06899)1 + 6.899/(1.06899)2 + 6.899/(1.06899)3 + 106.899/(1.06899)4
                              = 100.

                             1. The par rate for a bond may be calculated from the set of spot rates reflect-
                                ing maturities up to and including the maturity of the desired par rate. Using
                                the spot rate data shown in Exhibit 1, calculate the par rate for a three-year
                                Canadian government bond. In this example (and subsequent examples),
                                annual payments and compounding are assumed.

                                (i.e., 0.7952/100). Thus, the par rate equals 0.7952%.



                          Forward Rates from Spot Rates
                          Spot rates can also be used to calculate implied forward rates (also known as forward
                          yields), which are breakeven reinvestment rates. They link the return on an investment
                          in a shorter-term zero-coupon bond to the return on an investment in a longer-term
                          zero-coupon bond.
                              Suppose that the yields-to-maturity on three-year and four-year zero-coupon bonds
                          are 3.65% and 4.18%, respectively. An analyst would like to know how much extra
                          return is implied by these rates for investing for four rather than three years (i.e., an
                          incremental year). This would be the implied one-year forward yield three years into
                          the future, depicted in Exhibit 4.

                           t=0                                 t=3              t=4

                                                                     Implied forward rate =
            3-year zero
                                         ZA = 3.65%                           3y1y

The most common market practice is to name this forward rate the “3y1y,” pronounced
“three-year into one-year rate,” or simply “3’s, 1’s.” The first number refers to the length
of the forward period in years from today, and the second number refers to the tenor
of the underlying bond, or its remaining time-to-maturity. In the money market, the
forward rate is usually expressed in months.
    If the investor’s view on future bond yields is that the one-year yield in three years’
time is likely to be lower than the 3y1y, it might be better to simply invest in the
four-year zero-coupon bond. However, if the investor’s view is that the one-year yield
will be more than the implied forward rate, the investor might prefer the three-year
bond and then reinvest at the expected higher rate for an additional one year. That
explains why an implied forward rate is the breakeven reinvestment rate.
    Equation 3 is a general formula for the implied forward rate, IFR A,B–A, for a security
begins at t = A and matures at t = B (tenor B – A). To solve for it, we need the spot
rate, zA, and the longer-term spot rate, zB. This is illustrated in Exhibit 5.
   (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A= (1 + ZB)B.                                              (3)

Using Equation 3, let’s solve for the 3y1y since we know that the yields-to-maturity
on three-year and four-year zero-coupon bonds are 3.65% and 4.18%, respectively:
   (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A= (1 + ZB)B.

   (1 + 0.0365)3 × (1 + IFR3,1)1 = (1 + 0.0418)4.

                              IFR3,1 = 0.057863 = 5.79%
                          The “3y1y” implied forward yield is 5.79%. If the investor believes that the one-year
                          yield will be higher than that in three years, she should invest in the three-year bond
                          rather than the four-year bond (and vice versa).

                           EXAMPLE 3

                             Deriving Forward Rates from Spot Rates

                             1. Let’s return to the spot rates shown in Exhibit 1. In the following example,
                                we will assume annual compounding (i.e., periodicity of 1). Calculate the
                                2y1y implied forward rate on Canadian government bonds.
                                Solution:
                                To calculate the 2y1y implied forward rate, we recognize that we are esti-
                                mating the one-year rate at a point two years from Time 0. Therefore, A = 1,
                                B = 3, Z A is the two-year spot rate, and ZB is the three-year spot rate:
                                 (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A = (1 + ZB)B.

                                 (1 + 0.00568)2 × (1 + IFR2,1)1 = (1 + 0.007977)3.

                                 IFR2,1 = 0.0126.
                                Thus, the implied forward rate for a one-year bond two years from now is
                                1.26%.



                          Spot Rates from Forward Rates and Bond Pricing with Forward
                          Rates
                          While forward rates can be calculated from spot rates, spot rates can also be calculated
                          from forward rates, and either can be used for pricing because they are interconnected.
                          An example will illustrate this process.
                             Suppose the current sequence of one-year rates today and the one-year rate one,
                          two, and three years from now are as follows:
                                   Time Period                                     Forward Rate

                                   0y1y                                                1.88%
                                   1y1y                                                2.77%
                                   2y1y                                                3.54%
                                   3y1y                                                4.12%

                          These are annual rates stated for a periodicity of 1. They are effective annual rates. The
                          first rate, the 0y1y, is the one-year spot rate. The others are one-year forward rates.
                          Spot rates can be calculated using Equation 3. The two-year implied spot rate is 2.324%:
                              (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A= (1 + ZB)B.

                              (1 + 0.0188)2 × (1 + 0.0277)1 = (1 + Z2)3.

                              Z2 = 0.023240 = 2.324%

Par and Forward Rates                                                                      221


Notice how the product of the 0y1y and 1y1y is the two-year spot rate. This property
holds in general, because the spot curve can be calculated by taking the geometric
average of the forward rates. This is evident if we solve for the implied three- and
four-year spot rates. Using Equation 3, we can use the implied two-year spot rate we
just found to solve for the three-year spot rate:
   (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A= (1 + ZB)B.

   (1 + 0.023240)2 × (1 + 0.0277)1 = (1 + Z3)3.

   Z3 = 0.027278 = 2.73%
Or since the two-year spot rate is the product of the 0y1y and 1y1y rates, we can simply
multiply across the forward curve for three- and four-year spot rates:
   (1.0188 × 1.0277 × 1.0354) = (1+ Z3)3; Z3 = 0.27278

   (1.0188 × 1.0277 × 1.0354 × 1.0412) = (1 + Z4)4; Z4 = 0.030741
Suppose that an analyst needs to value a four-year 3.75% annual coupon payment
bond that has the same risks as the bonds used to obtain the forward curve. Using
the implied spot rates, the value of the bond is 102.637 per 100 of par value.

     Solution:
     1. B. The 1y2y is a two-year forward rate in one year. Thus, we start with the
     three-year spot rate and use the one-year spot rate to find an implied two-
     year forward rate.
     2. C. The 3y2y is a two-year forward rate in three years. Thus, we start with
     the five-year spot rate and use the three-year spot rate to find an implied
     two-year forward rate.
     3. A. The 2y1y is a one-year forward rate in two years. Thus, we start with
     the three-year spot rate and use the two-year spot rate to find an implied
     one-year forward rate.

  4. Determine the missing words in the following sentence: An implied forward
     rate represents a ____________ reinvestment rate such that no arbitrage
     opportunities exist between spot and forward rates.
     Solution:
     An implied forward rate represents a breakeven reinvestment rate such that
     no arbitrage opportunities exist between spot and forward rates.

                                 ■    Buy a three-year government bond at the 3% spot rate, and then rein-
                                      vest for two years at the expected future two-year rate.
                                 ■    Buy a five-year government bond at the 4% spot rate.
                                Solution:
                                Calculate the implied two-year forward rate in three years:
                                 (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A = (1 + ZB)B.

                                 IFR3,2 = 5.52%
                                If the investor believes that the two-year rate in three years will be greater
                                than 5.52%, then the better strategy is to buy the three-year government
                                bond and reinvest at a higher rate. If the investor believes that the two-year
                                rate in three years will be less than 5.52%, then the five-year bond should be
                                purchased. The implied forward rate represents the breakeven reinvestment
                                rate.

Because spot, par, and forward rates are interconnected, so are the shapes of the spot,
par, and forward curves. This analysis is best illustrated through an example. In an
earlier lesson, we used spot rates to compute par rates and forward rates for Canadian
and Australian government bonds. We can use these rates to build yield curves across
a range of maturities, shown in Exhibit 1.

226   Learning Module 9                         The Term Structure of Interest Rates: Spot, Par, and Forward Curves


                              We can make the following general observations:
                              1. The spot rates are positive, and the spot curve is upward sloping.
                              2. The spot and par curves are nearly identical; the par rates are slightly lower
                                 than the spot rates, and the (slight) difference between the spot and par
                                 curves is greater at longer maturities.
                              3. Forward rates are greater than the spot and par rates.
                              These observations stem from general relationships between the shapes of the
                          curves. If the spot curve is upward sloping, par rates will be near—but below—spot
                          rates, particularly at the long end of the curve. This is because the low short-term
                          spot rates result in higher bond prices, particularly for longer-term bonds, which
                          results in low par rates when we do the calculation that assumes the price is 100% of
                          par. Forward rates being above spot rates, if the spot curve is upward sloping, follows
                          from the prior lesson, which established forward rates as incremental rates of return.
                              Exhibit 6 shows the spot, par, and forward curves if the spot curve is flat, assumed
                          to be 2.50% for all maturities. When the spot rate is constant across all maturities,
                          the par and forward rates will equate to the spot rate across all maturities as well. In
                          short, a flat spot rate curve reflects no expectations of changes in future interest rates;
                          thus forward rates equal spot rates. In this particular example, government bonds
                          would pay a 2.5% coupon rate, and the bonds would be priced at par value (thus, the
                          par rate is also 2.5%).

                          Exhibit 7 shows the spot, par, and forward curves for a downward-sloping (inverted)
                          spot curve or falling spot rates as maturities lengthen. Starting from a 4% 1-year spot
                          rate, rates fall to 1.90% for a maturity of 10 years. As in the previous examples, the par
                          rates are similar to the spot rates. The inverted term structure of spot rates reflects
                          expectations of significantly lower one-year rates in future years, and this is shown
                          by the forward curve. In this example, the spot rate term structure implies a one-year
                          rate of 0.1175% expected in nine years.

                           QUESTION SET


                             1. The chart below shows a spot curve and its implied forward curve.
                                Identify the forward curve, and justify your choice.
                                            5.0

                                                  1    2    3     4   5    6    7   8    9     10
                                Solution:
                                The forward curve is represented by the line that moves from 3.0% to ap-
                                proximately 1.5% in Year 5 and then slopes dramatically higher from Year 5
                                to 6, ending at about 4.5% in Year 10.
                                When the spot curve is sloping downward (Years 1–5), forward rates will
                                be below spot rates. When the spot curve is sloping upward (Years 6–10),
                                forward rates will be above spot rates.

                             For Questions 2 and 3, refer to the spot rate data shown in Exhibit 9. It is
                             important to note that some bonds will trade at negative yield. This was prev-
                             alent among developed market sovereign bonds in the wake of the financial
                             crisis as central banks pursued accommodative monetary policy in response
                             to below-target inflation. Negative rates do not change the fundamental math-
                             ematics used in bond pricing.

  2. Calculate the implied one-year forward rate in nine years in Switzerland.
     Solution:
     The question is requesting the 9y1y forward rate. This is calculated from the
     10-year and 9-year spot rates, as follows:
      (1 + ZA)A × (1 + IFRA,B – A)B – A = (1 + ZB)B

      (1 + -0.001945)9 × (1 + IFR9,1)1 = (1 + -0.001216)10

      IFR9,1 = 0.537%
     Thus, the implied one-year forward rate in nine years for Swiss government
     bonds is 0.537%.

  3. Explain why a country with negative spot rates, such as Switzerland, may
     have positive forward rates.
     Solution:
     As shown in earlier examples, an upward-sloping spot curve (which Swit-
     zerland has) will be characterized by forward rates that are greater than spot
     rates. As the negative rates become less negative and move closer to zero,
     the more likely that forward rates will be positive with an upward-sloping
     spot curve.

  4. The following chart shows spot and forward curves for German sovereign
     bonds. Explain why the forward curve is close to identical to the spot curve
     for two and three-year maturities.

                                Spot           Par        Forward
     Solution:
     In flat term structure environments, forward rates equal spot rates. The spot
     rates in Germany for two and three-year maturities appear to be approxi-
     mately equivalent to the one-year spot rate. Thus, Germany’s term structure
     is flat for the first three years, and forward rates should be approximately
     equal to spot rates.

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. Given that Switzerland’s current five-year spot (and par) rate is nega-
   tive, any non-negative coupon will cause the Swiss government to issue debt at a
   premium to par. Issuance of debt without a coupon will minimize the size of the
   premium.

   PV = 108.07.

3. C is correct. In Example 2, we calculated the three-year Canadian par rate. The
   par rate of 0.7952% approximates the spot rate of 0.7977%, so the most important
   change affecting the three-year par rate is the change in the three-year spot rate.
   Because it does not change, the only change will be a slight move in the par rate
   toward the spot rate (to approximately 0.7968%).

4. 1. B. By using two-year and five-year rates, the difference represents the tenor
   of the implied forward rate of three years, and the shorter tenor rate reflects the
   beginning of the forward in two years.
   2. C. By using two-year and seven-year rates, the difference represents the tenor
   of the implied forward rate of five years, and the shorter tenor rate reflects the
   beginning of the forward in two years.
   3. A. By using five-year and seven-year rates, the difference represents the tenor
   of the implied forward rate of two years, and the shorter tenor rate reflects the
   beginning of the forward in five years.

5. The correct answer is A. The implied five-year forward rate in two years is the
   2y5y rate. To calculate, we use the seven-year Swiss government rate and the
   two-year Swiss government rate, as follows:
   2y5y IFR = [(1 – 0.003402)7/(1 – 0.007133)2](1/5) – 1 = 0.191%.
   Choice B represents the 5y2y implied forward rate, and Choice C represents the
   2y3y implied forward rate.

6. 1. B. This is a series of three one-year forwards, thus providing the information
   for a three-year spot rate.
   2. C. This sequence is a one-year spot rate, followed by a two-year forward rate in
   one year, followed by a three-year forward rate in three years.
   3. A. This sequence is a series of four one-year forwards.

7. The correct answer is C. The forward rates used to construct forward curves are
   derived from spot rates. Statement A is not true, because par rates are derived
   from spot rates. Statement B is not true, because par curves are derived from
   spot rates.

8. 1. B. In a normal interest rate environment with an upward-sloping yield curve,
   forward interest rates will be greater than their corresponding spot rates across

                              2. A. In an inverted spot rate environment, forward interest rates will be below
                              their corresponding spot rates.
                              3. C. A flat maturity structure of interest rates is sometimes assumed. In such an
                              environment in which spot rates are constant, this implies that future expecta-
                              tions are for interest rates to remain at a constant level. Thus, forward rates equal
                              spot rates in a flat term structure environment.

                          9. 1. A. This situation is illustrated in the German and Swiss government interest
                             rate data in which spot rates are negative while the spot rate curve is upward
                             sloping. In such instances, par rates lie above spot rates.
                             2. B. This situation is illustrated in the Canadian and Australian government
                             interest rate data in which spot rates are positive and the spot curve is normal.
                             3. C. This is a hypothetical case but can be seen by creating a flat spot rate curve.

INTRODUCTION
Prior lessons on yield measures established that a fixed-income investor’s rate of
                                                                                         1
return will equal a bond’s yield-to-maturity (YTM) under certain assumptions. In
these lessons, we explore the sources of return for fixed-income investments and
demonstrate investment returns in different scenarios, including the one embedded in
the YTM calculations. Prior lessons also established interest rate risk. We show how
investment horizon, in relation to a bond’s features, is a key determinant of interest
rate risk for investors and how different investors in the same fixed-income invest-
ment can have different returns and views on risk. Finally, we introduce Macaulay
duration, a weighted-average measure of the time to receipt for a bond’s cash flows,
and demonstrate how holding a bond for its Macaulay duration balances reinvestment
and price risks.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   There are three sources of return for fixed-rate bond inves-
          tors: (1) coupon and principal payments, (2) reinvestment of
          coupons, and (3) gain or loss on the sale of the bond if the bond is sold
          prior to maturity.
      ■   The rate of return on a fixed-rate bond investment is found by using
          the holding period, the future value of coupons received, the sale price,
          and the purchase price to calculate a compounded, annualized rate of
          return.

                                  ■   If all cash flows are received at scheduled dates, coupons are rein-
                                      vested at the same rate as a bond’s YTM, and the bond is held to
                                      maturity, an investor’s annualized compounded rate of return will
                                      equal the bond’s YTM. If any of those assumptions do not hold, the
                                      investor’s rate of return will vary.
                                  ■   Reinvestment risk and price risk are types of interest rate risk and have
                                      an inverse relationship. Reinvestment risk is the risk of decreasing
                                      reinvestment returns on cash flows, which occurs when interest rates
                                      fall. Price risk refers to declining prices and occurs when interest rates
                                      rise.
                                  ■   The longer the investment horizon, the more important reinvestment
                                      risk is relative to price risk. If an investor’s investment horizon equals
                                      the Macaulay duration of a bond, the risks equally offset each other.
                                  ■   Macaulay duration is the weighted-average time to receipt of a bond’s
                                      cash flows, where the weights of each cash flow in the calculation are
                                      each cash flow’s share of the bond’s full price (i.e., present value).
                                  ■   When the investment horizon is greater than (less than, equal to) a
                                      bond’s Macaulay duration, coupon reinvestment risk is higher than
                                      (lower than, equal to) the bond’s price risk.



                            LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                              These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                              of understanding of the learning module.

                              1. A source of risk for a buy-and-hold fixed-income investor, ignoring credit
                                 risk, is from:
                                  A. capital gain/loss on sale only.
                                  B. coupon reinvestment only.
                                  C. neither capital gain/loss on sale nor coupon reinvestment.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. Changes in interest rates during the holding period of the bond
                                 will impact returns from reinvestment of coupons.
                                 A is incorrect because for a buy-and-hold investor, there is no risk of capital
                                 gain or loss since the investor is not selling the bond prior to maturity and
                                 will get the par value of the bond at the maturity date.
                                 C is incorrect because a buy-and-hold investor’s returns are impacted by the
                                 rate earned on the reinvestment of coupons, or reinvestment risk.

                              2. A family office purchases a six-year, 5.8% annual coupon eurobond priced at
                                 par for settlement on 15 December 2031. The bond matures on 15 Decem-
                                 ber 2037. Immediately after the purchase of the bond, interest rates rise to
                                 6.5%. The family office sells the bond after three years. The family office’s
                                 total annualized return on the investment was closest to:
                                  A. 5.28%.
                                  B. 5.80%.

Introduction                                                                              237


      C. 6.50%.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The total annualized return is composed of the (1) coupon
     payments, (2) reinvestment of coupons, and (3) gain/loss on the sale. This is
     equal to 5.28%, as shown below.
     The future value of the coupons including reinvestment is
      = –FV(0.065, 3, 5.8, 0, 0) = 18.556.
     The sale price of the bond after three years is
      = –PV(0.065, 3, 5.8, 100, 0) = 98.146.
     The realized return, r, is
                  _1
               FV ​T ​
      	​r = ​(_
              ​PV ​)​ ​− 1.​

                               _1
               18.556 + 98.146 ​3 ​
      	​r = ​(  
              ____________
              ​    100     )
                           ​ ​ ​− 1.​

      r=0.0528=5.28%
     B is incorrect because it would be the return if interest rates remained at
     5.8%.
     C is incorrect because 6.5% is the interest rate at which the coupons will be
     reinvested, not the rate of return for the family office on the investment.

  3. The risk to an investor who buys a bond at par value and intends to sell it
     before the receipt of the first coupon payment, ignoring credit risk, is most
     likely from:
      A. price risk.
      B. reinvestment risk.
      C. neither price risk nor reinvestment risk.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Changes in interest rates can affect the price of the bond and,
     therefore, the returns for the investor.
     B is incorrect because if the investor intends to sell the bond before the
     receipt of the first coupon, then reinvestment risk is irrelevant because no
     coupons will be reinvested.
     C is incorrect because the investor faces price risk.

  4. Reinvestment risk and price risk of a bond offset one another if an investor’s
     investment horizon is:
      A. equal to the bond’s time-to-maturity.
      B. equal to the bond’s Macaulay duration.
      C. less than the bond’s Macaulay duration.
     Solution:
     B is correct. When the investment horizon is equal to the Macaulay dura-
     tion, the gain (loss) from coupon reinvestment is offset by the loss (gain) in
     the price of the bond from changes in interest rates.
     A is incorrect because if an investor holds a bond to maturity (ignoring
     credit risk), the investor faces no price risk but does face reinvestment risk.
     Therefore, reinvestment risk will dominate price risk.

                                 C is incorrect because if the investment horizon is less than the Macaulay
                                 duration, price risk dominates reinvestment risk.

                              5. Hightest Capital purchases a 15-year, 6.8% annual coupon bond and has an
                                 investment horizon of 7.0 years. The Macaulay duration of the bond is 9.85
                                 years. The duration gap at the time of purchase is closest to:
                                  A. 2.85.
                                  B. 5.15.
                                  C. 8.00.
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. The duration gap for a bond is the difference between its Ma-
                                 caulay duration and the investor’s investment horizon: 9.85 – 7.0 = 2.85.
                                 B is incorrect because it is the difference between the bond’s maturity and
                                 its Macaulay duration (15 – 9.85 = 5.15).
                                 C is incorrect because it is the difference between the bond’s maturity and
                                 the investor’s investment horizon (15 – 7 = 8.00).

                              6. Consider a bond that has two years remaining to maturity, a coupon of 4%

                                 into the first coupon period and a 30/360 basis, the bond’s annualized Ma-

                                 as it is 63 days into the period. Each subsequent cash flow is received one
                                 period later after the first, so time-to-receipt = 0.65 + 1, 0.65 + 2, and so on.

                              7. Consider a bond that has five years remaining to maturity, a coupon of 0%
                                 paid annually, and a yield-to-maturity of –0.38%. Assuming it is the issuance
                                 date and a 30/360 basis, the bond’s annualized Macaulay duration is closest
                                 to:
                                  A. 3.5361 years.

SOURCES OF RETURN FROM INVESTING IN A
FIXED-RATE BOND                                                                              2
                 calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a
                 fixed-rate bond;

Fixed-rate bond investors have three sources of return: (1) receipt of promised coupon
and principal payments on the scheduled dates, (2) reinvestment of coupon payments,
and (3) potential capital gains or losses on the sale of the bond prior to maturity. We
now focus on how interest rate changes affect the reinvestment of coupon payments
and a bond’s market price if sold prior to maturity.
    We start with two investors buying BRWA’s new 10-year, 6.2% (annual) coupon
eurobond, but each investor has a different time horizon for holding it. Initially, inter-
est rates are unchanged. Then, we demonstrate the impact of higher interest rates on
investors’ total return. Finally, we show the effect of lower interest rates.

EXAMPLE 1

   The first investor, Viswan Family Office (VFO), is a “buy-and-hold” investor,
   purchasing BRWA’s new 10-year, 6.2% (annual) coupon eurobond priced at
   par (settlement: 15 October 2025; maturity: 15 October 2035) and holds it to
   maturity. If the coupon payments are reinvested at 6.2%, the yield-to-maturity,
   the future value of the coupons on the bond’s maturity date, is found using
   Microsoft Excel’s FV function:
      = -FV(Rate, Nper, Pmt, Pv, Type),
   where Type indicates payment at the end (0) or beginning (1) of the period. For
   this bond,
      = -FV(0.062, 10, 6.2, 0, 0) = 82.493 per 100 of par value.

                                 While 62 (= 6.2 × 10) in total coupons is received, the excess amount,
                              20.493 (= 82.493 – 62), is the “interest-on-interest” gain from reinvesting and
                              compounding. The investor’s rate of return, expressed as a compound annual
                              growth rate, is 6.20%.

                                  r = 0.0620 = 6.20%.

                               Example 1 demonstrates that yield-to-maturity at the time of purchase equals the
                           investor’s rate of return under three assumptions: (1) the investor holds the bond to
                           maturity, (2) there is no default by the issuer, and (3) the coupon interest payments
                           are reinvested at that same rate of interest.
                               Example 2 considers the second investor, Baywhite Financial (Baywhite), which also
                           buys the 10-year, 6.2% annual coupon payment bond and pays the same price. However,
                           Baywhite has a four-year investment horizon, so coupon interest is reinvested for four
                           years, and the bond is sold immediately after receiving the fourth coupon payment.

                            EXAMPLE 2

                              Baywhite buys BRWA’s 10-year, 6.2% eurobond but sells after four years. If the
                              coupon payments are reinvested at 6.2% for four years, the future value of the
                              reinvested coupons is 27.20321 per 100 of par value.
                                  = −FV(0.062, 4, 6.2, 0, 0) = 27.203.
                                 Interest-on-interest gain from reinvesting and compounding is 2.403 (=
                              27.203 – 24.800). When the bond is sold, it has six years remaining to maturity.
                              Assuming yield-to-maturity remains 6.2%, the sale price is still 100% of par.
                                 Baywhite’s annualized rate of return is 6.20%:

                                          ​ 100 ​)​ ​− 1.​

                                  r = 0.0620 = 6.20%.

                               Horizon yield is an investor’s IRR based on the total return (reinvested coupon
                           payments plus sale price or redemption amount) and the purchase price of the bond.
                           The horizon yield on a bond investment is the annualized holding-period rate of return.
                               In Example 2, Baywhite’s horizon yield is 6.2%, which matches the original
                           yield-to-maturity even though Baywhite did not hold the bond until maturity. This
                           example shows that the realized horizon yield matches the original yield-to-maturity
                           if (1) coupon payments are reinvested at the same interest rate as the original
                           yield-to-maturity and (2) the bond is sold at a price on the constant-yield price tra-
                           jectory, implying there is no capital gain or loss when the bond is sold. Importantly,
                           capital gains (losses) arise if a bond is sold at a price above (below) its constant-yield
                           price trajectory, as shown in a prior lesson.

    A point on the trajectory represents the carrying value of the bond at that time.
The carrying value is the purchase price plus (minus) the amortized amount of the
discount (premium) if the bond is purchased at a price below (above) par value. The
constant-yield price trajectory for the investors in Example 1 and Example 2 is a flat
curve at a price of 100 as the bonds were purchased and sold at par.
    We now demonstrate the impact of higher interest rates on VFO and Baywhite by
increasing interest rates by 100 basis points (bps) immediately after investment. The
yield on the bond increases from 6.20% to 7.20%, and coupon reinvestment rates go
up by 100 bps as well.

EXAMPLE 3

  VFO, the buy-and-hold investor, purchases BRWA’s new 10-year, 6.2% (annual)
  coupon eurobond at par, and then interest rates immediately increase to 7.20%.
  The future value of the reinvested coupons at 7.20% for 10 years is
      = −FV(0.072, 10, 6.2, 0, 0) = 86.475.
      And VFO’s realized rate of return (horizon yield) is 6.43%:
                 _1
              FV ​T ​
      	​r = ​(_
              ​PV ​)​ ​− 1.​

                           _ 1
              86.475 + 100 ​10 ​
      	​r = ​(_
              ​ 100 ​)​ ​− 1.​

      r = 0.0643 = 6.43%.

    VFO benefits from the higher coupon reinvestment rate. The realized horizon
yield is 6.43%, 23 bps higher than the outcome in Example 1, when interest rates were
constant. Importantly, VFO does not incur a capital gain or loss because it holds the
bond until maturity.

EXAMPLE 4

  Baywhite buys the same BRWA eurobond at par, interest rates immediately rise
  to 7.2%, and it sells the bonds four years later. The future value of the reinvested
  coupons at 7.2% is
      = -FV(0.072, 4, 6.2, 0, 0) = 27.609.
      We must also calculate the sale price of the bond because the change in
  interest rates affects the bond’s price and, unlike VFO, Baywhite is selling it
  before maturity. We calculate the sale price after four years as
      = –PV(0.072, 6, 6.2, 100, 0) = 95.263,
      resulting in a realized four-year horizon yield of 5.28%:
                 _1
              FV ​T ​
      	​r = ​(_

      r = 0.0528 = 5.28%.

                               While Baywhite also benefits from the higher coupon reinvestment rate, it is more
                           than offset by the capital loss from the sale of the bonds at the higher yield (lower
                           price). Thus, Baywhite’s rate of return is lower than in Example 2, where the interest
                           rate remained at 6.2%.
                               We now examine the rates of return for these two investors if interest rates decline
                           by 100 bps; the yield on the BRWA bonds fall from 6.20% to 5.20% immediately after

                              1. Calculate the future value of reinvested coupons.
                                 Solution:
                                 The future value of reinvesting the coupon payments at 5.20% for 10 years is
                                  = −FV(0.052, 10, 6.2, 0, 0) = 78.715.

                                 Solution:
                                 VFO’s horizon yield is 5.98%:

                                  r = 0.0598 = 5.98%.

                                 ample 3.
                                 Solution:
                                 VFO suffers from the lower coupon reinvestment rate. The realized horizon
                                 yield of 5.98% is 22 bps lower than the result in Example 1, when interest
                                 rates were unchanged, and 45 bps lower than the result in Example 3. There
                                 is no capital gain or loss, because the bonds are held until maturity. VFO’s
                                 experience indicates that interest rate risk for a buy-and-hold investor arises
                                 entirely from reinvestment risk.

                                 The future of the reinvested coupons is
                                  = –FV(0.052, 4, 6.2, 0, 0) = 26.802.

   5. Calculate Baywhite’s horizon yield (realized rate of return).
      Solution:
      The sale price of the bond after four years is
      = –PV(0.052, 6, 6.2, 100, 0) = 105.043,
      resulting in a realized four-year horizon yield of 7.16%:

      	​r = ​(_

      r = 0.0716 = 7.16%


   6. Contrast Baywhite’s investment outcome in this scenario to Example 2 and
      Example 4.
      Solution:
      The reduction in the future value of the coupons is more than offset by Bay-
      white’s capital gain from the sale. Consequently, Baywhite’s horizon yield is
      higher than in both Example 2 and Example 4.

    As just demonstrated, interest income is the return associated with the passage of
time, so it includes the receipt of coupon interest, the reinvestment of those coupons,
and the amortization of the discount (or premium) from purchase at a price below (or
above) par value to realign the return with the market discount rate. A capital gain
or loss is the investor’s return associated with the change in the value of the security,
which for a fixed-rate bond arises from a change in the yield-to-maturity (i.e., the
implied market discount rate).
    This series of examples illustrates an important point about fixed-rate bonds: an
investor’s investment horizon is at the heart of understanding interest rate risk and
return. There are two offsetting types of interest rate risk that affect the bond investor:
reinvestment risk and price risk. The future value of reinvested coupon payments
increases when interest rates rise and decreases when rates fall. The sale price on
a bond that matures after the horizon date decreases when interest rates rise and
increases when rates fall.
    Reinvestment risk matters more when the investor has a long-term investment
horizon. A buy-and-hold investor only has reinvestment risk. Price risk matters
more when the investor has a short-term investment horizon. An investor who sells
before the first coupon is received has only price risk. Thus, two investors holding
the same bond can have different exposures to interest rate risk if they have different
investment horizons.

                                 Solution:
                                 The carrying value of a bond is the total value of the price at which the bond
                                 was purchased plus (minus) the adjustment for amortization of the discount
                                 (premium) if the bond is purchased at a price below (above) par value.

                                 The answer to A is increase. The future value of coupons has a direct rela-
                                 tionship with interest rates. Rising interest rates mean coupons are reinvest-

                                 The answer to B is decrease. The future value of coupons has a direct rela-
                                 tionship with interest rates. Falling interest rates mean coupons are reinvest-

                                 two years. Immediately after the purchase of the bond, interest rates rise to
                                 5.9%. The investor’s total return at the end of two years is closest to:
                                  A. 5.23%.
                                  B. 5.60%.
                                  C. 5.75%.
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. The investor’s total return is composed of the (1) coupons, (2)
                                 reinvestment of coupons, and (3) gain/loss on sale prior to maturity.
                                 The future value of the coupons assuming reinvestment at 5.90% is
                                  = –FV(0.059, 2, 5.6, 0, 0) = 11.5304.

                                 The realized rate of return is 5.23%:

      r = 0.0523 = 5.23%.
     B is incorrect because it is the rate of return if interest rates remain at 5.60%.

     rates fall to 6.3%. The investor’s annualized rate of return at the end of four
     years is closest to:
      A. 6.50%.
      B. 6.66%.
      C. 6.89%.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The future value of the coupon and its reinvestment at 6.30% is
      = –FV(0.063, 4, 6.7, 0, 0) = 29.441.
     The sale price of the bond after four years is
      = –PV(0.063, 3, 6.7, 100, 0) = 101.063.
     The investor’s rate of return is 6.89%:

      r= 0.0689 = 6.89%.
     A is incorrect because this is the average of the annual coupon rate and the

We now extend the prior discussion by introducing a third investor in BRWA’s 10-year,
6.2% annual eurobonds: Hightest Capital, which has an 8-year time horizon. If interest
rates remain at 6.20%, the future value of reinvested coupon interest is
   = –FV(0.062, 8, 6.2, 0, 0) = 61.807.

                           When the bond is sold, it has two years remaining to maturity. Assuming
                           yield-to-maturity remains at 6.2% and the sale price is 100, Hightest’s horizon yield
                           (realized rate of return) is 6.20%:

                           If interest rates immediately rose to 7.20% after the purchase, the future value of
                           coupons would increase:
                               = –FV(0.072, 8, 6.2, 0, 0) = 64.071.
                           And the price of the bond at the time of sale would fall:

                               r = 0.0624 = 6.24%.
                           Notice that the capital loss from the bond sale of 1.803 (= 98.197 – 100.00) is roughly
                           matched by the additional coupon reinvestment income of 2.265 from the increase
                           in interest rates. Therefore, Hightest’s total return is nearly the same as in the stable
                           rate scenario (6.24%, compared with 6.20%).
                               Now assume instead that market interest rates fall by 100 bps, to 5.20%. The future
                           value of coupons decreases while the price of the bond at the time of sale increases:
                               = –FV(0.052, 8, 6.2, 0, 0) = 59.630.

                               = –PV(0.052, 2, 6.2, 100, 0) = 101.854.
                           Hightest’s realized eight-year horizon yield is now 6.17%:

                               r = 0.0617 = 6.17%.
                           Notice that the capital gain from the bond sale of 1.854 is roughly matched by the
                           decrease in coupon reinvestment income. Again, Hightest’s total return is nearly the
                           same as in the stable rate scenario (6.17%, compared to 6.20%).
                               Hightest’s investment results, along with those of VFO and Baywhite, are summa-
                           rized in Exhibit 1. They reveal an important outcome for Hightest with the eight-year
                           horizon: Total returns and horizon yields are nearly the same regardless of interest rates.

Hightest’s investment horizon of eight years was chosen to illustrate an important
quantity for the BRWA bond and fixed-income instruments generally: Macaulay
duration, a holding period for a bond that balances coupon reinvestment gain (loss)
and price loss (gain) for a one-time instantaneous “parallel” shift in the yield curve
once the bond purchase is settled. It is named after Frederick Macaulay, the Canadian
economist who introduced the concept in 1938. Given the result for Hightest, we know
that the Macaulay duration of this BRWA bond is close to eight years.

                           As shown in Panel A, when interest rates rise, there is an immediate drop in price.
                           Then, as time passes, the bond price is “pulled to par.” The increase in the future
                           value of reinvested coupons starts small but builds over time, and the curve indicates
                           the added future value of reinvested coupons due to the higher interest rate. At the
                           Macaulay duration, the two effects offset each other: the gain on reinvested coupons
                           is equal to the loss from the increase in interest rates.
                               The same pattern is shown in Panel B, when interest rates fall. There is an imme-
                           diate increase in price, but then the “pull-to-par” effect brings the price down as
                           time passes. The impact from reinvesting at a lower rate starts small but becomes
                           significant over time. Again, the Macaulay duration indicates the point when the two
                           effects offset each other, so the gain from the decrease in interest rates equally offsets
                           the loss from coupon reinvestment at lower rates.
                               The foregoing discussion allows for statements about the general relationships
                           among interest rate risk, the Macaulay duration, and the investment horizon shown
                           in Exhibit 3:

Duration

The Macaulay duration of the BRWA bond is 7.7429 years (the calculation will be
demonstrated in the next lesson). So, Statement 1 reflects VFO’s situation with its
10-year horizon; Statement 2, Hightest, the investor with the 8-year horizon; and
Statement 3, Baywhite, the investor with the 4-year horizon.
    As shown in Equation 1, the duration gap for a bond is the difference between
its Macaulay duration and the investor’s investment horizon.
   Duration gap = Macaulay duration – Investment horizon.                           (1)
VFO, with a 10-year horizon, has a negative duration gap. Therefore, the primary risk
it faces is lower interest rates. Hightest, with the eight-year horizon, has a duration
gap of approximately zero, so it is nearly hedged against interest rate risk. Baywhite,
with the four-year horizon, has a positive duration gap and is at risk of higher rates.
Importantly, as time passes, the investment horizon is reduced and the Macaulay
duration of the bond also falls.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK

  Three investors, Rook Point Investors, Fyleton Investments, and Amy
  Investments, purchase a 5.61%, 30-year Romanian eurobond at par
  value. The bond’s Macaulay duration is 15.16 years. Rook Point’s investment
  horizon is five years, while Fyleton and Amy have investment horizons of 15
  and 30 years, respectively.

  1. Calculate the returns for the three investors for three scenarios:

     Scenario 1: Interest rates fall by 50 bps immediately after the purchase.

     Scenario 2: Interest rates stay stable at 5.61%.

     Scenario 3: Interest rates rise by 50 bps immediately after the purchase.
     Solution:
     The total returns under the various scenarios for each investor are shown in
     the table below.
     The key point to note is that when an investor’s investment horizon is
     almost equal to the bond’s Macaulay duration, the returns under various in-
     terest rate scenarios remain the same. The gain (loss) from coupon reinvest-
     ment risk is offset by the loss (gain) from the price risk.

                                            Solution:
                                            The answer to A is falling interest rates. A negative duration gap means that
                                            the bond’s Macaulay duration is lower than the investor’s investment hori-
                                            zon, which means that reinvestment risk is the dominant source of interest
                                            rate risk, from falling interest rates.
                                            The answer to B is rising interest rates. A positive duration gap means that
                                            the bond’s Macaulay duration is higher than the investor’s investment hori-
                                            zon, which means that price risk is the dominant source of interest rate risk,
                                            from rising interest rates.

                                          2. Complete the equation below with the following terms:

                                            Macaulay duration

                                            Investment horizon

                                            Time-to-maturity

                                            Duration gap = __________ – __________.
                                            Solution:
                                            Duration gap = Macaulay duration – Investment horizon.

Macaulay Duration                                                                                251


   3. An investor intends to hold a bond with eight years remaining to maturity
      for eight years. The bond’s Macaulay duration is 6.841. The investor is pri-
      marily exposed to which of the following interest rate risks:
       A. Price risk
       B. Reinvestment risk
       C. Neither price nor reinvestment risk
      Solution:
      B is correct. A buy-and-hold investor is not exposed to price risk, because
      she does not intend to sell the bond prior to maturity. However, her rate of
      return is impacted by the rate at which she can reinvest coupons.
      Alternatively, the investor’s investment horizon is eight years, whereas the
      bond’s Macaulay duration is 6.841. When the investment horizon exceeds
      the Macaulay duration, reinvestment risk dominates.




MACAULAY DURATION
                                                                                             4
              define, calculate, and interpret Macaulay duration.

The prior lesson established Macaulay duration as a holding period for a bond that
balances reinvestment and price risk. We now turn to its calculation.
    The most straightforward way to understand the Macaulay duration of a traditional
fixed-rate bond is that it is the weighted average of the time to receipt of the bond’s
cash flows, where the weights of each cash flow in the calculation are each cash flow’s
share of the bond’s full price (i.e., present value). Before we introduce the general
equation, let’s take a specific example to demonstrate the calculation of Macaulay
duration: BRWA’s 10-year, 6.2% (annual) coupon eurobond used in the previous lessons.
    Exhibit 4 illustrates the calculation of Macaulay duration at issuance, assuming
the bond was issued at par, settled on 15 October 2025, and matures on 15 October
2035. Because this is a corporate bond, we assume a 30/360 day-count basis.

                               ■      Columns 1 and 2 show the number of periods and the time to receipt of the
                                      cash flow, respectively. If the calculation is done at issuance or on a coupon
                                      date, they are equal.
                               ■      Column 3 is the cash flow per 100 of par value, and column 4 is the present
                                      value of that cash flow.
                               ■      The fifth column is the weight, or each cash flow’s share of total PV. Notice
                                      that the final payment, PMTN + FVN, of 106.2 accounts for 58% of the
                                      bond’s PV.
                               ■      The sixth column is the time to receipt of the cash flow (Column 2) mul-
                                      tiplied by the weight (Column 5). The sum of this column is the Macaulay
                                      duration, 7.7429. This is close to Hightest Capital’s investment horizon of
                                      eight years from the prior lesson, which means that Hightest has balanced
                                      its reinvestment and price risk.
                               Macaulay duration is often quoted as an annualized statistic. Since this bond pays
                           coupons annually, no adjustment is needed. If the bond were a semiannual coupon
                           bond, we would divide the Macaulay duration by 2 (two semiannual periods per year)
                           to obtain an annualized Macaulay duration. When quoted as an annualized statistic,
                           the units for Macaulay duration is years.
                               Notice how 7.7429 years is less than 10, the time-to-maturity of the bond. This is
                           because Macaulay duration is a present value–weighted average of the time to receipt
                           of the cash flows, while time-to-maturity is the time to receipt of the final cash flow.
                               The general calculation of Macaulay duration, MacDur, that also accounts for
                           partial coupon periods if the calculation is done between coupon dates is shown in
                           Equation 2.

  Macaulay Duration between Coupon Dates
  Now let’s compute the Macaulay duration for the BRWA bond between cou-
  pon dates—specifically, on 11 December 2025, 57 days after issuance. The only
  difference from the prior example is that we are 57 days in the future, so rather
  than t/T = 0 like at issuance, t/T = 57/360, and each cash flow’s time to receipt
  is 57 days earlier.

                              Comparing this example to the prior example, we see that the time to receipt of
                              each flow is lower, reflecting the fact that we are 57 days later, which increases
                              the present value of each cash flow. However, the present value weight of each
                              cash flow remains the same. The Macaulay duration (7.5845) is lower than in
                              the prior example (7.7429), reflecting the lower times to receipt.
                                  This example demonstrates an important property of Macaulay duration: it is
                              not static; it falls as time elapses and the time to receipt of each cash flow falls.

                             Besides a spreadsheet, Macaulay duration also can be calculated using the
                           DURATION function in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets:
                               =DURATION(Settlement, Maturity, Coupon, Yld, Frequency, [Basis])
                               where

                                     Settlement is the date of settlement, in DATE form

                                     Maturity is the maturity date, in DATE form

                                     Coupon is the annual coupon rate

                                     Yld is the annualized yield-to-maturity

                                     Frequency is the periodicity, typically the number of coupon payments per
                           year; it is 1 for annual, 2 for semiannual, 4 for quarterly
                                    [Basis] is the day-count convention; 0 or omitted is 30/360, 1 is act/act, 2 is
                           act/360, 3 is act/365
                              Finally, another approach to calculating Macaulay duration is to use a closed-form
                           equation derived using calculus and algebra, shown as Equation 3:

                               	​MacDur = ​{_                                }

                              PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                           1. Assuming no capital gain or loss when the bond is sold, an investor’s horizon
                              yield is equal to a bond’s yield-to-maturity at the time of investment if coupons
                              are reinvested at a rate:
                               A. lower than the bond’s yield-to-maturity at investment.

                               B. equal to the bond’s yield-to-maturity at investment.

                               C. higher than the bond’s yield-to-maturity at investment.

                           2. An investor purchases an eight-year, 6.4% annual coupon eurobond priced at
                              par (settlement: 15 June 2031; maturity: 15 December 2039) and sells it after six
                              years. Assuming interest rates rise by 100 bps immediately after purchase, the
                              investor’s rate of return at the end of six years is:
                               A. lower than 6.4%.

                               B. equal to 6.4%.

                               C. higher than 6.4%.

                           3. The carrying value of a bond purchased at a price below par is equal to the origi-
                              nal purchase price:
                               A. minus the accumulated premium amortization.

                               B. minus the accumulated discount amortization.

                               C. plus the accumulated discount amortization.

                           4. The duration gap at which reinvestment risk and price risk are equal is:
                               A. less than zero.

                               B. equal to zero.

                               C. greater than zero.

                           5. When an investor’s investment horizon is less than a bond’s Macaulay duration,
                              the investor faces downside risk if, after the purchase of the bond, interest rates:
                               A. decrease.

                               B. increase.

                               C. either decrease or increase.

                           6. An investor purchases a 12-year, 5.8% annual bond and intends to sell it after 10
                              years. The Macaulay duration of the bond is 8.97 years. If interest rates fall by 75
                              bps immediately after the purchase of the bond, the investor faces:
                               A. negative reinvestment risk.

                               B. no reinvestment risk.

                               C. positive reinvestment risk.

7. Consider a bond that has three years remaining to maturity, a coupon of 4% paid

                              SOLUTIONS
                           1. B is correct. For the horizon yield to match the original yield-to-maturity of the
                              bond, two conditions must be met:
                              (1) The coupon payments are reinvested at the original yield-to-maturity.
                              (2) The bond is sold at the constant-yield price trajectory, implying no capital
                              gain or loss when the bond is sold.
                              Since there is no gain or loss when the bond is sold, the horizon yield will be
                              equal to the yield-to-maturity if the first condition is met (i.e., the coupons are
                              reinvested at the original yield-to-maturity).
                              A is incorrect because the horizon yield will be lower than the yield-to-maturity
                              if the coupons are reinvested at a lower rate than the original yield-to-maturity,
                              assuming no capital gain or loss on sale of the bond.
                              C is incorrect because the horizon yield will be higher than the yield-to-maturity
                              if the coupons are reinvested at a higher rate than the original yield-to-maturity,
                              assuming no capital gain or loss on sale of the bond.

                           2. A is correct. The future value of reinvested coupon interest is
                               = FV(0.054,6,6.4,0,0) = 46.245.
                               The sale price of the bond at the end of six years is
                               = PV(0.054,2,6.40,100,0) = 98.202,
                               which results in a six-year horizon yield of 6.32%, which is lower than 6.40%:

                                                    ​ ​ ​− 1.​

                               r = 0.0632 = 6.32%.
                               B and C are incorrect, because interest rates have risen and the investor’s in-
                               vestment horizon is not long enough to offset the price decline with additional
                               reinvestment return.

                           3. C is correct. A bond purchased at a discount will have its price “pulled to par” as
                              it approaches maturity. Its carrying value at time t is equal to its purchase price
                              plus the accumulated discount amortization.
                              A is incorrect because a bond purchased below par is purchased at a discount,
                              not a premium.
                              B is incorrect because the accumulated discount amortization is added, not sub-
                              tracted, from the purchase price to calculate carrying value.

                           4. B is correct. Reinvestment risk and price risk equally offset each other when an
                              investor’s investment horizon equals a bond’s Macaulay duration. This is when
                              the duration gap is zero.
                              A is incorrect because a duration gap of less than zero means that Macaulay
                              duration is less than the investor’s investment horizon and that reinvestment risk
                              is higher than price risk.
                              C is incorrect because when the duration gap is greater than zero, the Macaulay
                              duration is greater than the investor’s investment horizon, so price risk is higher
                              than reinvestment risk.

5. B is correct. If the investment horizon is less than the bond’s Macaulay duration,
   then the investor’s risk is higher interest rates. For such an investor, the market
   price risk dominates the coupon reinvestment risk.
   A is incorrect because an investor faces risk due to a lower interest rate when the
   investment horizon is greater than the bond’s Macaulay duration.
   C is incorrect because when the investment horizon is less than the Macaulay du-
   ration, the investor faces risk due to higher interest rates, not lower interest rates.

6. A is correct. The investor has an investment horizon of 10 years, which is greater
   than the Macaulay duration of 8.97 years. Therefore, reinvestment risk dominates
   price risk.
   B is incorrect because the investor faces reinvestment risk because the invest-
   ment horizon is higher than the Macaulay duration.
   C is incorrect because the investor faces negative coupon reinvestment risk, not
   positive coupon reinvestment risk, since the coupons will be reinvested at a lower
   interest rate.

7. B is correct.

8. A is correct. Hightest Capital’s investment horizon is four years, which is less
   than the bond’s Macaulay duration of 5.86 years. Therefore, price risk dominates
   reinvestment risk and Hightest Capital faces price risk from rising interest rates.
   B is incorrect because the increase in interest rates is beneficial for coupon rein-
   vestment. Therefore, Hightest Capital has positive reinvestment risk.
   C is incorrect because Hightest Capital faces the risk that the price of the bond
   will fall as a result of the 50 bp increase in interest rates and therefore has nega-
   tive price risk.

Prior lessons explored two sources of interest rate risk—reinvestment risk and price
                                                                                            1
risk—and demonstrated how holding a bond for its Macaulay duration balances them.
This lesson and those that follow extend that discussion by introducing measures of
price risk. Two broad categories of such measures exist: those that assume underlying
bond cash flows are certain and measure price sensitivity to changes in a bond’s own
yield, which are covered in these lessons, and those that introduce the possibility of
a bond default and that measure price sensitivity to changes in a benchmark yield
curve, which are covered in later lessons. This lesson will illustrate how the interest
rate risk of a bond is a function of its features, including its time-to-maturity, coupon
rate, and yield.
    Most of the examples and exhibits used throughout the reading can be downloaded
as a Microsoft Excel workbook. Each worksheet in the workbook is labeled with the
corresponding example or exhibit number in the text.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Duration is a quantitative measure of interest rate risk. There
           are several duration measures, including those that measure
           a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in its own yield-to-maturity and
           assume underlying cash flows are certain (yield duration) and those
           that measure changes in a benchmark yield curve, with less certain
           underlying cash flows (curve duration).
       ■   Macaulay duration, modified duration, money duration, and the price
           value of a basis point (PVBP) are yield duration measures.

                                  ■   Modified duration is the slope or first derivative of the price of a bond
                                      with respect to its yield-to-maturity, measuring the sensitivity of a
                                      bond’s price to changes in its yield-to-maturity. Modified duration can
                                      be calculated using a bond’s Macaulay duration and yield or through
                                      approximation.
                                  ■   Money duration is an extension of modified duration and incorpo-
                                      rates the size of the bond position in currency terms. Related to this
                                      measure is the price value of a basis point, which is an estimate of the
                                      change in the price of a bond for a 1 bp change in the bond’s yield.
                                  ■   Duration can be used to estimate the change in the price of a bond
                                      in response to a change in yield, but it assumes a linear relationship
                                      between price and yield even though, in fact, the relationship is non-
                                      linear. This is most evident when estimating price changes for large
                                      changes in yield and for bonds with certain features.
                                  ■   A bond’s features, including its time-to-maturity, coupon rate, and
                                      yield-to-maturity, determine its duration. Duration, for a given bond,
                                      is not static and decreases as the bond approaches maturity.
                                  ■   All else equal, a longer (shorter) time-to-maturity, a lower (higher)
                                      coupon rate, or a lower (higher) yield-to-maturity results in higher
                                      (lower) duration or higher (lower) interest rate risk.

Introduction                                                                             265


  2. If all other characteristics of a bond are held constant, an increase in the
     bond’s yield-to-maturity will most likely result in:
      A. a decrease in the bond’s modified duration.
      B. no change in the bond’s modified duration.
      C. an increase in the bond’s modified duration.
     Solution:
     A is correct. An increase in the bond’s yield-to-maturity will result in a low-
     er modified duration because future cash flows are discounted at a higher
     rate, which reduces the present-value-weighted average of their time to
     receipt.
     B is incorrect because duration is affected by the present value of the bond’s
     cash flows, which, in turn, is affected by the bond’s yield.
     C is incorrect because an increase in the bond’s yield-to-maturity reduces
     the present value of each cash flow and hence reduces the bond’s duration.

  3. Consider a bond with an annualized modified duration of 4, a coupon of 5%,
     and a price of 95. The expected change in the price of the bond, per 100 of
     par value, for a 50 bp increase in the bond’s yield-to-maturity is closest to:
      A. 4.75.
      B. 3.80.
      C. 1.90.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The money duration is 380:
      MoneyDur = AnnModDur × PVFull.

      MoneyDur = 4.0 × 95.

      MoneyDur = 308.
     This results in a change in price of –1.90 for a 50 bp increase in the bond’s
     yield:
      ΔPVFull ≈ −MoneyDur × ΔYield.

      ΔPVFull ≈ −308 × 0.005.

      ΔPVFull ≈ −1.90.
     The change in price is negative for the increase in the yield-to-maturity.

  4. Two bonds, Bond X and Bond Y, are identical except that Bond X has a low-
     er coupon rate than Bond Y. Therefore:
      A. the bonds will have identical modified duration.
      B. Bond X will have a lower modified duration compared to Bond Y.
      C. Bond Y will have a lower modified duration compared to Bond X.
     Solution:
     C is correct. If two bonds are identical in all other respects (e.g., time-to-ma-
     turity, yield, etc.), the bond with the lower coupon rate will have the higher
     modified duration. This is because, compared to Bond Y, the present value
     of each of Bond X’s coupon cash flows will make up less of the bond’s price,
     while the contribution to the price of the bond from the face value will be
     greater.

                              5. Estimating the price value per basis point by dividing the difference in the
                                 price of a bond for a 0.0001 decrease and a 0.0001 increase by 2 ignores:
                                   A. convexity of the bond’s price–yield relationship.
                                   B. concavity of the bond’s price–yield relationship.
                                    C. symmetry in the bond’s price–yield relationship.
                                   Solution:
                                   A is correct. This formulation of the price value of a basis point does not
                                   include an adjustment for convexity. This is important because the price
                                   change for increases and decreases in yields is asymmetric, owing to the
                                   convex relationship between price and yield.

                              6. The change in the price of a bond when its yield increases by 100 bps is best
                                 described as:
                                   A. less than the change in price for a decrease in its yield by 100 bps.
                                   B. the same as the change in price for a decrease in its yield by 100 bps.
                                    C. greater than the change in price for a decrease in its yield by 100 bps.
                                   Solution:
                                   A is correct. The price–yield relationship for most bonds is convex, such
                                   that the increase in the price of a bond is greater for yield decreases than a
                                   decrease in the price for the same yield increase.

                           Recall from prior lessons that the price of a bond moves inversely with its yield. We
                           can illustrate this by pricing bonds at varying yields-to-maturity. Exhibit 1 shows
                           prices for three bonds introduced in prior lessons at yields ranging from 0% to 10%.

bonds and each bond’s yield increased from 2% to 3%, the changes in price for each
would be starkly different:

While graphs of the price–yield relationship can help in visualizing different bonds’
interest rate risk, numbers are more useful so that investors can rank bonds by their
price sensitivity to changes in yield.
    A logical numerical expression for a bond’s interest rate risk is the slope, or first
derivative, of its price–yield line. We would expect the slope of the line for the one-year
Australian bond, for example, to be relatively low, since the line is nearly flat. But we
would expect the slope of the line for the 30-year Romanian bond to be high since
that line is relatively steep. While candidates are not responsible for using calculus, we
show the steps required to find the first derivative of the price–yield line to illustrate
the logic behind the equations.
    Recall that the price, PV, of an option-free bond is the present value of the bond’s
cash flows.

      	​PV = _
             ​ PMT 1 ​+ _
                        ​ PMT 2 ​+ ... + _
                                         ​ PMT N ​+ _
                                                                                         FV
                                                    ​ N ​.

First, we take the derivative with respect to r, the yield-to-maturity:

      	​ dr ​ = _                              ​+ ... + _

                           While this gives us the change in a bond’s price for a change in yield, it does so in
                           terms of PV, but percentage change in price would be more useful. To get percentage
                           change, we divide by PV (price):

                           Macaulay duration, MacDur, introduced in prior lessons. We can substitute MacDur

                           Without the negative sign, this is known as a bond’s modified duration, or ModDur:

                                	​ModDur = ​_
                                                     MacDur
                                            (1 + r) ​.​	                                                                        (2)

                           ModDur can be annualized, like Macaulay duration, by dividing by the number of
                           coupon periods per year for the bond.
                               Since ModDur captures the relationship between a bond’s price and its yield, we
                           can use it to estimate the percentage price change for a bond given a change in its
                           yield-to-maturity, if we substitute –AnnModDur for the right side of Equation 1 and
                           multiply both sides by dr, or the change in annualized yield-to-maturity:
                                      ​ ​Full​ ≈ − AnnModDur × ΔAnnYield.​	
                                	​%ΔP V                                                                                         (3)
                           For example, if a bond’s modified duration is 5, its price will decrease by an estimated
                           5% for a 100 bp increase in yield: –5 × 0.01 = –5%. Therefore, the higher a bond’s
                           modified duration, the steeper its price–yield relationship line is and the more sensitive
                           its price is to changes in yield.
                               The percentage price change refers to the full price, which includes accrued inter-
                           est. The ≈ sign indicates that this calculation is an estimation because it is a linear
                           approximation of the nonlinear relationship between price and yield, which will be
                           covered in detail in a later lesson. The negative sign indicates that bond prices and
                           yields-to-maturity move inversely with one another.
                               Modified duration can also be obtained directly using the MDURATION function
                           in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. The inputs are the same as the DURATION
                           function to calculate Macaulay duration:
                                = MDURATION(Settlement, Maturity, Coupon, Yld, Frequency, [Basis]).

                                Modified Duration for the BRWA Bond
                                We can use Equation 2 to calculate modified duration for the five-year BRWA
                                bond for settlement at issuance and for 57 days after issuance.

                                    ModDur = 8.86184; AnnModDur = 4.43092.
                              If the annual yield on BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% semiannual coupon bond, settling
                              on 15 October 2025 and maturing on 15 October 2030, were to instantaneously
                              (right after issuance) increase by 80 bps, to 4.00%, the estimated change in price
                              would be –3.67%.
                                    %ΔPVFull ≈ –4.58676 × 0.0080 = –0.0366941.
                              If the yield-to-maturity were to instantaneously (right after issuance) decrease
                              by 80 bps, to 2.40%, the estimated change in price would be +3.67%.
                                    %ΔPVFull ≈ –4.58676 × –0.0080 = 0.0366941.
                              Notice that the estimates for price changes are equal (in absolute value) for
                              both an increase and a decrease in the yield-to-maturity. However, as we saw in
                              Exhibit 1, the price–yield relationship is not a straight line but, rather, a curved
                              or “convex” line. In a later lesson, we will add a “convexity adjustment” to account
                              for this and improve the accuracy of price change estimations.



                           Approximate Modified Duration
                           While modified duration for a fixed-rate bond can be easily obtained if the Macaulay
                           duration is already known, an alternative approach is to approximate modified duration
                           by estimating the slope of the line tangent to the price–yield curve of a bond, as shown
                           in Exhibit 2. This approach is useful for bonds with unknown Macaulay duration,
                           owing to contingency features or default risk, which will be shown in later lessons.

The quoted full price of the bond is denoted PV0. To estimate the slope, the
yield-to-maturity is changed up and down by the same amount—the ΔYield—and is
used to calculate corresponding bond prices PV+ and PV–. We can use these variables
to find the slope of the line tangent to the price–yield curve: the difference between
PV+ and PV– divided by twice the assumed change in the yield-to-maturity. To find
the slope in terms of percentage change in PV0, we further divide by PV0. This is
shown as Equation 4.

This equation approximates annualized modified duration; the frequency of coupon
payments and the periodicity of the yield-to-maturity are included in the bond price
calculations. The following example illustrates the accuracy of this approximation.

  Approximate Modified Duration for the BRWA Bond
  Consider BRWA’s 3.2% semiannual coupon payment bond for settlement 15
  October 2025, maturing 15 October 2030 and yielding 3.2%. The full price (PV0)
  is par or 100.00.
      We can raise the annual yield-to-maturity by 5 bps, from 3.20% to 3.25%
  (denoted r+), to obtain PV+ of 99.771.

                              The “exact” annual modified duration we calculated for this BRWA bond was
                              4.58675, and the “approximation” is 4.586765—virtually identical results.
                              Therefore, although duration can be calculated using the Macaulay duration
                              approach, it can also be estimated quite accurately.

                             The Macaulay duration also can be approximated by multiplying the approximate
                           modified duration by 1 plus the yield per period.

                              1. Suppose a 4%, semiannual coupon bond has an annualized Macau-
                                 lay duration of 3.589. The anticipated percentage change in the bond’s full
                                 price if the bond’s yield rises from 5% to 6% is closest to:
                                 A. 3.485%.
                                 B. 3.502%.
                                  C. 3.589%.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. The Macaulay duration in years is 3.589; therefore, the annual-
                                 ized modified duration is 3.502%:

                                 	​ModDur = ​_
                                                 MacDur
                                             (​ 1 + r)​ ​.​

                                                    3.589
                                 	​ odDur = ​_
                                 M           (​ 1 + 0.025)​​.​

                                 ModDur = 3.502.
                                 This results in an estimated percentage change in price for a 100 bp increase
                                 in yield of –3.502%:
                                 %ΔPVFull ≈ −AnnModDur × ΔAnnYield.

                                 %ΔPVFull ≈ −3.502 × 0.01.

                                 %ΔPVFull ≈ −3.502%.


                              2. True or false: Duration measures are used to measure the sensitivity of flat
                                 bond prices to changes in yields.
                                 A. True

Modified Duration                                                                        273


      B. False
     Solution:
     B is correct. Duration measures are used to measure the sensitivity of full
     prices to changes in yields. Also known as the dirty price of a bond, full
     prices include the appropriate time value of each cash flow, whereas the flat
     price does not include accrued interest.

  3. Bond C has a coupon rate of 1%, paid semiannually, and matures in five
     years. If its yield-to-maturity is –0.5%, its Macaulay duration is most likely:
      A. less than its modified duration.
      B. the same as its modified duration.
      C. greater than its modified duration.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Recall that a bond’s modified duration is equal to its Macaulay
     duration divided by 1 plus its yield-to-maturity:

      	​ModDur = ​_
                    MacDur
                  (1 + r) ​.​

     If the yield, r, is negative, the denominator will be less than 1, which results
     in a MacDur less than the modified duration.

  4. Consider a zero-coupon bond that matures in five years and is priced to
     yield 3%. The modified duration of this bond is:
      A. less than five years.
      B. five years.
      C. more than five years.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The Macaulay duration of a zero-coupon bond is its
     time-to-maturity, because a zero-coupon bond has a single cash flow with a
     present value weight of 1.0. The modified duration of this zero-coupon bond
     is less than its Macaulay duration because its yield is positive.

        Macaulay and modified durations, which are nearly four times that of the
        BRWA bond.
        The Australian bond has the least interest rate risk, because its Macaulay
        and modified durations are less than a quarter of that of the BRWA bond.

  7. Chowdhury’s portfolio manager expects interest rates to decrease from
     current levels. Which of these three bonds would most likely perform best in
     that environment, all else equal? Justify your answer.
        Solution:
        The Romanian bond would perform best. A decrease in interest rates would
        increase bond prices, with those having the greatest interest rate risk or
        duration having the highest increase.

                           POINT

                                          define, calculate, and interpret modified duration, money duration,
                                          and the price value of a basis point (PVBP)

                           Modified duration is used to measure the percentage price change of a bond given
                           a change in its yield-to-maturity. A related statistic is money duration. The money
                           duration of a bond is a measure of the price change in currency units. The money
                           duration can be stated per 100 of par value or in terms of the actual position size. In
                           the United States, money duration is commonly called “dollar duration.”
                               Money duration (MoneyDur) is the product of the annualized modified duration
                           and the full price (PVFull) of the bond, in either percent of par or the currency value
                           of the position.
                               MoneyDur = AnnModDur × PVFull.                                                (6)
                           The estimated change in the bond price in currency units is very similar to Equation
                           4. The difference is that for a given change in the annual yield-to-maturity (ΔYield),
                           modified duration estimates the percentage price change while money duration esti-
                           mates the change in currency units.
                               %ΔPVFull ≈ −MoneyDur × ΔYield                                                 (7)




                              BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% semiannual coupon bond, maturing 15 October 2030,
                              is priced to yield 3.2%. Assume it is purchased by an institutional investor for
                              settlement on 11 December 2025, so 57 days into the first coupon period (t/T
                              = 57/180).
                                  The full price of the bond is 100.504 per 100 of par value, and the annualized
                              modified duration is 4.43092. Suppose the investor has a position in the bond
                              for a par value of USD100,000,000. Consequently,
                                  ■   the market value of the investment is USD100,503,921, and
                                  ■   the money duration of the investment is USD445,324,719 (= 4.43092 ×
                                      USD100,503,921).
                                 Therefore, if the yield-to-maturity rises by 100 bps—from 3.20% to 4.20%—the
                              expected loss is approximately USD4,453,247 (= –USD445,324,719 × 0.0100).

                              A similar measure is the price value of a basis point (PVBP), an estimate of the
                           change in the full price of a bond given a 1 bp change in its yield-to-maturity. The
                           PVBP can be calculated using a formula like that for approximating modified duration.
                           Equation 8 is the formula for the PVBP. PV– and PV+ are the full prices calculated by
                           decreasing and increasing the yield-to-maturity by 1 bp.

                           The PVBP is also called the “PV01,” standing for the “price value of an 01” or “present
                           value of an 01,” where “01” means 1 bp. In the United States, it is commonly called
                           the “DV01” for the “dollar value” of 1 bp. The PVBP is particularly useful for bonds
                           for which future cash flows are uncertain, such as callable bonds. A related statistic
                           called a “basis point value” (BPV) is simply the money duration times 0.0001 (1 bp).

  For a numerical example of the PVBP calculation, again consider BRWA’s five-
  year, 3.2% semiannual coupon bond, maturing 15 October 2030 and priced to
  yield 3.2%, purchased by the institutional investor for settlement on 11 December
  2025, so 57 days into the first coupon period (t/T = 57/180).
      To determine the PVBP of this bond, calculate the new prices by increasing
  and decreasing the yield-to-maturity. First, increase the yield by 1 bp (0.01%),
  from 3.20% to 3.21%, to solve for a PV+ of 100.459400.

      	​P ​V+​ ​ = [​ _                 ) 10 ]
                    1.60                  101.60

                            ​+ ... + _
                                     ​(      ​ ​× (​ 1.01605)​57/180​ = 100.459400.​
                ​ 1.01605 ​ ​         ​ 1.01605 ​ ​

      Then, decrease the yield-to-maturity by 1 bp, from 3.20% to 3.19%, to solve
  for a PV– of 100.548465.

      	​P ​V−​ ​ = [​ _                 ) 10 ]
                    1.60                  101.60
                      ​( )1
                            ​+ ... + _
                                     ​(      ​ ​× (​ 1.01595)​57/180​ = 100.548465.​
                ​ 1.01595 ​ ​         ​ 1.01595 ​ ​

  The PVBP is obtained by substituting these results into Equation 8.
                100.548465 − 100.459400

   Exhibit 3 provides a summary of the various yield duration statistics. To recap,
they measure the instantaneous change in a bond’s price for a given change in its
own yield-to-maturity, assuming all other variables (especially, time-to-maturity) are
unchanged and the underlying cash flows are certain.

Yield Duration of Zero-Coupon and Perpetual Bonds
Because zero-coupon bonds have a single payment, the face value at maturity, the pres-
ent weighted-average time to receipt of cash flows is the same as the time-to-maturity
because that single cash flow has a present value weight of 1.0. Therefore, the Macaulay
duration of a zero-coupon bond is its time-to-maturity, and modified duration is its
time-to-maturity divided by 1 plus its yield.

                               A perpetuity or perpetual bond is a bond that does not mature, so there is no face
                           or maturity value received at time T. The investor receives a fixed coupon payment
                           forever unless the bond is called. Non-callable perpetuities are rare, but they have an
                           interesting Macaulay duration:
                               MacDur = (1 + r)/r.                                                            (9)



                           Duration of Floating-Rate Notes and Loans
                           As described in an earlier lesson, interest on floating-rate instruments varies depending
                           on the level of a market reference rate (MRR) plus a quoted margin. At predetermined
                           dates, payment amounts are reset to reflect changes in the MRR. Therefore, interest
                           rate risk arises only between reset dates, because at the next reset date, coupon pay-
                           ments will adjust to the new MRR. Therefore, the Macaulay duration for a floating-rate
                           note or bond is simply the fraction of a period remaining until the next reset date:
                                                      (​ T − t)​
                               	​MacDu ​r​Floating​ = _
                                                      ​ T ​.​	                                               (10)

                           If there are 180 days in the coupon period and 57 days have passed since the last
                           coupon, the Macaulay duration is
                                                      ​(180 − 57)​
                               	​MacDu ​r​Floating​ = _
                                                      ​ 180 ​ = 0.683333.​

                           Floating-rate instruments typically have very low duration because coupon periods
                           are typically less than six months in length. As a result, they are commonly used by
                           investors to reduce duration in fixed-income portfolios.

                            KNOWLEDGE CHECK

                              An analyst is comparing the interest rate risk of the BRWA 3.2% bond
                              maturing 15 October 2030 to a floating-rate note (FRN) that also
                              matures 15 October 2030 and has its coupon reset semiannually.
                                At the last reset, 15 October 2027, the coupon rate of the FRN was 3.2%. The
                              BRWA bond was priced to yield 3.2% at that same date.

                              1. Why would you expect the FRN to have a lower duration than the BRWA
                                 fixed-rate bond?
                                 Solution:
                                 A floating-rate instrument has a Macaulay duration that reflects the time to
                                 the next coupon reset date, while a fixed-rate instrument has a Macaulay du-
                                 ration that primarily reflects time-to-maturity but also its coupon rate, yield,
                                 and fraction of the coupon period that has passed. The maximum Macaulay
                                 duration the FRN would have is six months, while the BRWA bond has a
                                 Macaulay duration slightly lower than its maturity (five years).

     For example, for 15 December 2027, the number of days since the next cou-
     pon is 61 days. The number of days in the coupon period is 183, calculated
     using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets as
      = COUPDAYS(DATE(2027,12,15),DATE(2028,4,15),2,1).
     Therefore, the Macaulay duration is (183 – 61)÷183 = 0.6667.

                                          2. If the client believes that interest rates will rise in the future, with all else
                                             held constant, which bond investment would most likely perform best?
                                             Solution:
                                             The Australian bond would perform best. Since it has the lowest duration
                                             and PVBP, the expected loss on the investment from an increase in its yield
                                             is lower than the BRWA and Romanian bonds. The expected loss from a 100
                                             bp increase in yield on the BRWA bond, for example, is almost six times that
                                             for the Australian bond (USD219,490 versus USD1.3 million).

                                                        explain how a bond’s maturity, coupon, and yield level affect its
                                                        interest rate risk

                                     The Macaulay and modified yield duration statistics for a traditional fixed-rate bond
                                     are primarily functions of the bond’s features: its time-to-maturity, its coupon rate,
                                     its yield-to-maturity, and the fraction of the current coupon period that has elapsed.
                                     The closed-form formula for Macaulay duration, presented in a prior lesson and again
                                     here, is useful in demonstrating the characteristics of duration (the same characteristics
                                     hold for modified duration, money duration, and price value of basis point).

All else being equal,
           ■           a lower-coupon bond has a higher duration and more interest rate risk than
                       a higher-coupon bond.
          The same pattern holds for the yield-to-maturity, so,
           ■           a lower yield-to-maturity increases the weighted average of the time to receipt
                       of cash flow and thus increases duration.
    The reason is that lower coupons and lower yields increase the weight of the
maturity value or final cash flow and reduce the weight of nearer-term cash flows in
the bond price.
           ■           Longer times-to-maturity typically correspond to higher duration.
    This pattern always holds for bonds trading at par or at a premium. In the
closed-form formula, the second expression within brackets is positive for premium and
par bonds, because the coupon rate (c) is greater than or equal to the yield-to-maturity

                           (r), so (c – r) ≥ 0, whereas the denominator is always positive. Therefore, the Macaulay
                           duration is always less than (1 + r)/r, and it approaches that threshold from below as
                           the time-to-maturity increases.
                                A curious result is illustrated in Exhibit 5 for discount bonds: at some point,
                           when the time-to-maturity is high enough, the Macaulay duration will exceed (1 +
                           r)/r, reach a maximum, and then decrease. This pattern develops when the number
                           of periods (N) is large and the coupon rate is below the yield-to-maturity, so (c – r) <
                           0. Then, the numerator of the second expression within braces can become negative.
                           The implication is that for long-dated bonds trading at a discount to par, interest rate
                           risk could be lower than that of a shorter-term bond.
                                For a constant yield-to-maturity (r), the expression in braces in the closed-form
                           formula is unchanged as time passes during the period. Therefore, the Macaulay
                           duration decreases smoothly as time passes and then jumps upward after the coupon
                           is paid, which creates a “saw-tooth” pattern. This pattern for the BRWA bond with
                           a constant yield-to-maturity is illustrated in Exhibit 6. As time passes, the Macaulay
                           duration decreases smoothly but jumps upward by a small amount on coupon dates.

   2. A bond analyst is comparing Bond D, a perpetual bond with a coupon of 5%,
      with Bond E, a zero-coupon bond maturing in five years. If both bonds are
      priced to yield 6%, Bond D has:
      A. lower interest rate risk.
      B. the same interest rate risk.
       C. higher interest rate risk.
      Solution:
      C is correct. The Macaulay duration for Bond D is 1.06/0.06 = 17.667. The
      Macaulay duration for Bond E is five years. The perpetual bond, Bond D, has
      higher interest rate risk.

                                                                   Bond X           Bond Z             Bond Y


                                      Which of the three bonds most likely has the longest time to maturity?
                                      A. Bond X
                                      B. Bond Y
                                       C. Bond Z
                                      Solution:
                                      B is correct. Bond Y has the steepest price-yield line, indicating that
                                      it has the greatest modified duration and, most likely, the longest
                                      time-to-maturity.

                              4. Between coupon payments, if the yield-to-maturity does not change, the
                                 Macaulay duration of a bond:
                                      A. decreases throughout the coupon period.
                                      B. is constant throughout the coupon period.
                                       C. increases throughout the coupon period.
                                      Solution:
                                      A is correct. During the coupon period, the Macaulay duration declines
                                      smoothly until the next coupon period, at which time it jumps. This is illus-
                                      trated in Exhibit 6.

                              5. Two bonds have the same time-to-maturity and yield-to-maturity, but one
                                 is trading at a premium to par and the other at a discount. The Macaulay
                                 duration for the premium bond is most likely_________ that of the discount
                                 bond.
                                      A. lower than
                                      B. the same as
                                       C. higher than
                                      Solution:
                                      A is correct. If two bonds have the same maturity and the same yield-to-ma-
                                      turity but one trades at a premium and one trades at a discount to par, the
                                      premium bond must have a higher coupon rate. Therefore, the premium
                                      bond has the lower Macaulay duration.

                           7. The portfolio manager is interested in comparing the interest rate risk of Bond
                              Three to that of Bond Four, a floating-rate note that resets every six months. On
                              1 June 2026, both bonds were priced to yield 5%. If the yield changes from 5%
                              to 5.25% halfway through the first coupon period, which bond has the greater
                              Macaulay duration?
                               A. Bond Three

                               B. Bond Four

                               C. Neither: The Macaulay duration is the same for both bonds.

Solutions                                                                                  291




   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. The Macaulay, modified, and money duration measures, as well as
   the price value of a basis point, are all types of yield duration. The curve duration
   is not classified as a type of yield duration.

2. B is correct.

4. A is correct. No calculation is necessary, as we know that a five-year zero-coupon
   bond has a Macaulay duration of 5, which is greater than that of a coupon bond
   like Bond three. Since they have the same yields, the bond’s modified durations
   will have the same relationship as their Macaulay duration.
   Alternatively, we can calculate Bond Three’s modified duration of 3.585:

 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              calculate and interpret convexity and describe the convexity
              adjustment
              calculate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified
              change in yield, given the bond’s duration and convexity

              of these measures




INTRODUCTION
While duration is a linear approximation of the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes
                                                                                           1
in yield, the true relationship between a bond’s price and its yield-to-maturity is a
curved (convex) line. We introduce convexity as a complementary risk measure to
improve bond price change estimates based on modified duration alone to account
for this non-linear relationship. The convexity adjustment becomes more important
when considering larger moves in yield-to-maturity and longer-maturity bonds. These
lessons will also show how to estimate duration and convexity for a portfolio of bonds,
as well as highlight limitations due to underlying assumptions.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Convexity is a complementary risk metric that measures the
          second-order (non-linear) effect of yield changes on price for
          an option-free fixed-rate bond. The convexity adjustment adds to the
          linear price estimate provided by modified duration.

                                  ■    Convexity is always positive for an option-free fixed-rate bond, such
                                       that estimated price increases from a decline in yields are higher than
                                       duration alone would suggest and estimated price decreases from
                                       an increase in yields are lower than duration alone would suggest.
                                       Therefore, convexity is valuable to investors.
                                  ■    Convexity has the same relationship with bond features as duration: a
                                       fixed-rate bond will have greater convexity the longer its time-to-ma-
                                       turity, the lower its coupon rate, and the lower its yield-to-maturity.
                                  ■    Money convexity expresses convexity in terms of currency units or
                                       percent of par for a position in a bond because it is the product of a
                                       bond’s annual convexity and its full price.
                                  ■    Portfolio duration and convexity can be calculated (1) as the weighted
                                       average of time to receipt of the aggregate cash flows or (2) by using
                                       the weighted averages of the durations and convexities of the individ-
                                       ual bonds that make up the portfolio.
                                  ■    While the first method is theoretically correct, it is difficult to use in
                                       practice. The second method is commonly used by portfolio managers
                                       but implicitly assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve, which are rare.

          Annualized convexity is 16.41283 and results from the sum of Column 7
          (65.65133) divided by the square of the periods per year (two periods per
          year: 22 = 4).

        2. Identify which of the following statements is true. The convexity adjustment:
           A. is always negative for an option-free fixed-rate bond.
           B. accounts for the first-order effect of yield changes on a bond.
           C. is added to the bond price change estimate provided by modified
              duration.
          Solution:
          C is correct. The convexity adjustment is added to the price change estimate
          provided by modified duration for a given change in yield-to-maturity:

                 ​ ​Full​ ≈ (− AnnModDur × ΔYield ) + ​[_
           	​%ΔP V                                      ​12 ​× AnnConvexity × ​(ΔYield)​2​]​.​

          A is incorrect because convexity is always positive for an option-free fixed-
          rate bond.
          B is incorrect because convexity accounts for the second-order effect of
          yield changes on a bond’s price and duration accounts for the first-order
          effect.

        Questions 3 and 4 relate to the following information.
           An investor holds a GBP50,000,000 position in a 10-year, 3.50% fixed-cou-
        pon bond (semiannual) trading at par value. Annualized modified duration is
        8.376, and annualized convexity is 81.701. The investor expects interest rates
        to decline by 100 bps.

        3. The expected percentage change in the price of the bond is closest to:
           A. 7.97%.
           B. 8.01%.
           C. 8.78%.
          Solution:
          C is correct. The expected price change is calculated as follows:

                                   First we calculate money convexity:
                                   MoneyCon = AnnConvexity × PVFull.

                                   MoneyCon = 81.701 × GBP50,000,000.

                                   MoneyCon = GBP4,085,033,604.
                                   Then we calculate the money convexity adjustment:

                                   	​MoneyConv . Adjustment ≈ [​ _
                                                                 ​12 ​× MoneyConvexity × (​ ΔYield)​2​]​.​

   6. Using weighted-average duration and convexity measures to estimate bond
      portfolio interest rate risk:
      A. is difficult in practice.
      B. is the theoretically correct approach.
       C. assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Using the weighted-average duration and convexity measures
      to estimate bond portfolio interest rate risk is easy in practice, but it is not
      the theoretically correct approach (using the weighted average of time to
      receipt of the aggregate cash flows is theoretically correct). It does, however,
      implicitly assume a parallel shift in the yield curve.




BOND CONVEXITY AND CONVEXITY ADJUSTMENT

Interest rate risk, or the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in yield, is an import-
ant concept used to analyze fixed-income exposures. As a key risk metric, modified
duration measures the first-order (linear) effect on a bond’s price change given a
yield-to-maturity change. Convexity is a complementary risk metric that measures
the second-order (non-linear) effect of yield changes on price for an option-free
fixed-rate bond, as shown in Exhibit 1.

298   Learning Module 12                                     Yield-Based Bond Convexity and Portfolio Properties


                           The true relationship between a bond’s price and its yield-to-maturity is the curved
                           (convex) line that shows the actual bond price given its market discount rate. Duration
                           (i.e., money duration) estimates the change in the bond price along the straight line
                           tangent to the curved line. For small yield-to-maturity changes, there is little differ-
                           ence between the lines.
                                However, for larger yield changes, the difference becomes significant and duration
                           alone is an insufficient risk measure. In such cases, a proper assessment requires
                           capturing the non-linear price effect of convexity. By considering duration and con-
                           vexity metrics together for relatively large yield changes, the estimated bond prices
                           are substantially closer to the actual bond prices. That is, when including convexity,
                           bond prices rise more when yields decrease and fall less when yields increase than
                           when estimated using duration alone.
                                As shown in Equation 1, convexity adds to the estimate of the percentage (full)
                           price change provided when using modified duration by itself, which was used in
                           prior lessons.

                           The first expression in parentheses is the effect from modified duration. The expression
                           in brackets is the convexity adjustment: the annual convexity statistic, AnnConvexity,
                           times one-half times the change in the yield-to-maturity squared. This term is always
                           positive for an option-free fixed-rate bond, so, as noted, the bond price is higher for
                           either an increase or decrease in yield (see Exhibit 1).
                               Similar to Macaulay and modified durations, AnnConvexity can be calculated in
                           several ways: (1) using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, (2) using an approximation
                           method, and (3) using a closed-form equation derived from calculus. We will now
                           demonstrate methods 1 and 2.
                               Consider once again BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% (semiannual) coupon bond priced
                           at par for settlement on 15 October 2025 and maturity on 15 October 2030. Exhibit
                           2 is an interactive spreadsheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook that
                           shows the calculation of AnnConvexity for this bond; notice that it is very similar to
                           the one used to calculate duration. The difference is the inclusion of a new column
                           (Col. 7) for the following operation (where CF means cash flow) to calculate convexity:
                               (Time to receipt of CF) × (Time to receipt of CF + 1) × (Weight of CF) × (1 +
                               Periodic YTM)(–Periods per year).
                           Note that the intermediate result of multiplying the first two terms introduces
                           non-linearity (Time to receipt of CF2). Dividing the sum of Column 7 (96.95578) by
                           periods per year squared (22=4) results in an annualized convexity (AnnConvexity)
                           statistic of 24.2389.

    Exhibit 2 can also be viewed as a spreadsheet on the candidate learning ecosystem
online in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook.
    Alternatively, Equation 2 can be used to approximate annualized convexity
(ApproxCon). This approach is useful for bonds with uncertain cash flows, such as
those with contingency features and default risk, which will be explored in later lessons.
Note that this equation uses the same inputs as approximating modified duration.

For BRWA’s bond, first raise the annual yield-to-maturity by 5 bps, from 3.20% to
3.25%, and determine PV+. Next, lower it by 5 bps, to 3.15%, and determine PV–. These
are the new full prices (original price is PV0 = 100.00). Using Excel’s PRICE function,
   PRICE(settlement, maturity, rate, yield, redemption, frequency, [basis]),
we have the following:
   PV+ = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2030,10,15),0.032,0.0325,100,2,0)
   = 99.770965.

   PV– = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2030,10,15),0.032,0.0315,100,2,0)
   = 100.229641.
Applying Equation 2, ApproxCon is estimated to be 24.23896, which is a very close
approximation to the bond’s AnnConvexity of 24.23895 we calculated in Exhibit 2.

                           Bond features that lead to greater convexity are the same as for duration. A fixed-rate
                           bond will have greater convexity:
                               ■   the longer its time-to-maturity,
                               ■   the lower its coupon rate, and
                               ■   the lower its yield-to-maturity.
                               Another factor is the dispersion of cash flows, meaning the degree to which pay-
                           ments are spread out over time. For two bonds with the same duration, the one with
                           the greater dispersion of cash flows has greater convexity. The positive attributes of
                           convexity for an investor are shown in Exhibit 3.

                                                                                        Less convex bond

                                              price–yield curve



                                                                    Yield-to-maturity




                           The two bonds depicted in Exhibit 3 are assumed to have the same price, maturity,
                           yield-to-maturity, and modified duration, so they share the same line tangent to
                           their price–yield curves. The benefit of greater convexity arises when their yields
                           change significantly. For the same decrease in yield-to-maturity, the more convex
                           bond appreciates more in price, while for the same increase in yield-to-maturity, the
                           more convex bond depreciates less in price. Consequently, the more convex bond
                           outperforms the less convex bond in both falling and rising yield environments, so it
                           is less risky for investors.
                                This conclusion assumes the difference in convexity is not reflected in the price of
                           the more convex bond. If it is priced in, the more convex bond would have a higher
                           price (and lower yield-to-maturity). The key point is that convexity is valuable to
                           investors for risk reduction, so they must pay for it.

                            EXAMPLE 1

                              Duration and Convexity of 30-Year Romanian Bond
                              A 30-year bond issued by the government of Romania has a coupon rate of
                              4.625% (paid annually) and currently trades at a yield-to-maturity of 4.75% on
                              15 October 2025, with a maturity date of 15 October 2055.

                                   1. Use Excel’s PRICE function to calculate ApproxModDur and
                                      ApproxCon using a 5 bp increase and decrease in yield-to-maturity.
                                   2. Compare and interpret the duration and convexity measures of the
                                      30-year Romanian bond and BRWA’s 5-year bond.

     To find ApproxModDur and ApproxCon, we must first calculate PV0 and
  then, using a 5 bp increase and decrease in YTM, calculate PV+ and PV–:
      PV0 = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2055,10,15),0.04625,0.0475,100,1,0)
      = 98.022448.

      PV+ = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2055,10,15),0.04625,0.0480,100,1,0)
      = 97.247386.

      PV– = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2055,10,15),0.04625,0.0470,100,1,0)
      = 98.806567.

     The duration and convexity of the Romanian bond are significantly higher
  than BRWA’s bond primarily due to its much longer time-to-maturity (30 years
  versus 5 years), which outweighs the Romanian bond’s higher coupon rate and
  YTM, features that decrease duration and convexity.

                                     a small anticipated change in yield-to-maturity.
                                     Solution:
                                     For a small change in YTM, modified duration is a reasonable estimate of
                                     the price change risk of a bond. Since the modified duration (or Approx-
                                     ModDur) values of Bond X and Bond Y are virtually identical (8.06571 and
                                     8.06560, respectively), the estimated price change based on a small change
                                     in YTM (either positive or negative) would be nearly identical for each bond.

  4. Compare and interpret the risk measures from Questions 1 and 2 relative to
     a large anticipated change in yield-to-maturity.
     Solution:
     For a large change in YTM, duration alone does not capture the expected
     price change of a bond. The convexity adjustment accounts for the non-lin-
     ear nature of the relationship of price to YTM. Since both bonds have vir-
     tually the same duration, the higher convexity of Bond Y should result in a
     smaller percentage drop given a large increase in YTM and a larger percent-
     age increase given a large decrease in YTM. In either case, Bond Y should
     perform better than Bond X for a large change in YTM.

  5. Compare and interpret each of the following features for its effect on the
     convexity of Bond X versus Bond Y:

     a. Maturity

     b. Coupon rate

     c. YTM
     Solution:
     a. Bond Y has a longer maturity than Bond X (10 years versus 9 years),
     which would increase Bond Y’s convexity relative to Bond X.
     b. Bond X has a lower coupon rate compared to Bond Y (2.25% versus
     5.33%), which would increase Bond X’s convexity relative to Bond Y.
     c. Bond X has a lower YTM compared to Bond Y (2.25% versus 2.34%),
     which would increase Bond X’s convexity relative to Bond Y.




BOND RISK AND RETURN USING DURATION AND
CONVEXITY                                                                                3
              calculate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified
              change in yield, given the bond’s duration and convexity

We now show how to estimate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified
yield change, given the bond’s duration and convexity. As we will show, such an esti-
mate is substantially closer to the bond’s actual price change than if estimated using
duration alone, allowing for more efficient risk management.
    Continuing with our focus on BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% (semiannual) coupon bond
priced at par for settlement on 15 October 2025 and maturity on 15 October 2030, if
its yield-to-maturity changes by ±100 bps from 3.20%, then the actual prices, using
Excel’s PRICE function, would be as follows:
   PV+ = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2030,10,15),0.032,0.0420,100,2,0)
   = 95.53212.

   PV– = PRICE(DATE(2025,10,15),DATE(2030,10,15),0.032,0.0220,100,2,0)
   = 104.71035.

                           So, the actual price–yield relationship for this bond is as follows:
                               ■   100 bp increase in yield (4.20%): Price = 95.53212; %∆PVFull = –4.46788%.
                               ■   100 bp decrease in yield (2.20%): Price = 104.71035; %∆PVFull = 4.71035%.
                               The modified duration for this bond was previously found to be 4.58676, so a 100 bp
                           increase (decrease) in yield-to-maturity results in %∆PVFull ≈ –4.58676% (4.58676%).
                               We now show the enhanced precision and risk reduction achieved by adding the
                           convexity adjustment to the duration estimate when determining the BRWA bond’s
                           percentage price changes. Using Equation 1 and the AnnConvexity metric, for ±100
                           bp changes in yield-to-maturity (from 3.20%), we have the following:
                               %∆PVFull ≈ (–4.58676 × 0.0100) + [½ × 24.23895 × (0.0100)2] = –4.46556%.

                               %∆PVFull ≈ (–4.58676 × –0.0100) + [½ × 24.23895 × (–0.0100)2] = 4.70795%.
                           Exhibit 4 compares the estimated percentage changes in BRWA’s bond prices for ±100
                           bp changes in yield using duration alone and using duration plus convexity against
                           the exact changes from Excel’s PRICE function. It is clear that enhanced precision is
                           achieved by adding the convexity adjustment, because the percentage price difference
                           is less than ¼ of a basis point by adding convexity versus about 12 bps with duration
                           alone. Note that this difference would be substantially greater for larger changes in
                           yield or for longer-maturity or lower-coupon bonds.

                           Recall that money duration indicates the first-order effect on the full price of a bond
                           in currency units given a change in yield-to-maturity. Money convexity (MoneyCon)
                           captures the second-order effect in currency terms and is the annual convexity mul-
                           tiplied by the full price, as in Equation 3.
                               MoneyCon = AnnConvexity × PVFull.                                                         (3)
                           Similar to estimating the percentage change in a bond’s full price, MoneyDur and
                           MoneyCon are combined to achieve a more accurate, thus less risky, estimate of the
                           change in a bond’s full price, as shown in Equation 4.

                               	​ΔP ​V​Full​ ≈ − ​(MoneyDur × ΔYield)​+ [​ _
                                                                           ​12 ​× MoneyCon × (​ ΔYield)​2​]​.​	          (4)

                           For a money convexity example, consider again BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% semiannual
                           coupon bond, settling 15 October 2025, maturing 15 October 2030, and yielding
                           3.2%—thus, priced at par. We saw previously that annual modified duration and annual
                           convexity for this bond are 4.58676 and 24.23895, respectively.
                              Suppose the investor has a position in the bond with a par value of USD100 million
                           and the yield-to-maturity increases by 100 bps. We saw earlier that the bond’s price
                           declines to 95.53212, so the market value of the position decreases to $95,532,116 (=
                           $100,000,000 × 0.9553212), a decline of $4,467,884.
                              Estimating the market value change using MoneyDur alone results in a larger
                           decline, $4,586,759 (= $458,675,875 × 0.0100), a difference of $118,875.

    However, using Equation 3, the MoneyCon for this position is $2,423,894,503 (=
24.23895 × $100,000,000), and if we apply Equation 4, which uses both MoneyDur and
MoneyCon, to estimate the market value change, the result is a decline of –$4,465,564,
as follows:

   	​− $4, 465, 564 ≈ − ​($458, 675, 875 × 0.01)​+ [​ _

By using both MoneyDur and MoneyCon, the difference in the estimated versus the
actual changes in bond position value is only $2,320. Exhibit 5 summarizes these
results and shows the estimated and actual changes in position value for a 100 bp
decrease in yield.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK

  An investor holds a position in five-year, zero-coupon Federal Republic
  of Germany bonds settling 11 May 2025 and maturing 11 April 2030.
  The yield-to-maturity is –0.72%, stated as an effective annual rate on an Act/
  Act basis. There are five annual periods, and settlement is 30 days into the
  365-day year.

  1. Calculate the full price of the bond per 100 of par value.
     Solution:
     Because Excel’s PRICE function does not work for negative yields, the
     equation for PV of a zero-coupon bond must be used. There are five annual
     periods, settlement is 30 days into the 365-day year, and because 1 + r = 1
     + (–0.0072) = 0.9928, the full price of the bond is 103.6175 per 100 of par
     value:

  2. Calculate MoneyDur and MoneyCon for the bond position using the results
     from Question 1.
     Solution:
      MoneyDur ≈ 6.283 × EUR10,000,000 = EUR62,829,180.

      MoneyCon ≈ 44.965 × EUR10,000,000 = EUR449,647,660.


  3. Calculate the estimated price change in the investor’s position in the bond
     using MoneyDur and MoneyCon for a 50 bp decrease in yield-to-maturity.
     Solution:
      ΔPVFull ≈ –(EUR62,829,180 × –0.005) + [½ × EUR449,647,660 × (–0.005)2]
      = EUR319,767.


  4. Calculate the difference between the estimated price change and the actual
     price change given a 50 bp yield-to-maturity decrease.
     Solution:
      PVFull = PRICE(DATE(2025,6,30),DATE(2032,6,30),0.0295,0.0345,100,2,0)
      = 103.198.
     The actual increase in the bond price is 3.1984%:
      ΔPVFull = 3.1984% × $10,000,000 = EUR319,840.
     The difference between the actual and the estimated price change is EUR73
     (= 319,840 – 319,767).




PORTFOLIO DURATION AND CONVEXITY
                                                                                           4
              calculate portfolio duration and convexity and explain the limitations
              of these measures

Just as duration and convexity provide measures of the interest rate risk of a single
bond, these metrics can also be used to measure the interest rate risk of a portfolio of
bonds. There are two ways to calculate the duration and convexity of a bond portfolio:
   1. Using the weighted average of time to receipt of the aggregate cash flows

                                  ual bonds that make up the portfolio
                               The first method is the theoretically correct approach, but it is difficult to use
                           in practice. Our focus will be the second method since it is commonly used by
                           fixed-income portfolio managers. We will also highlight its limitations.
                               Suppose an institutional investor holds a two-bond portfolio consisting of $50
                           million par value each of the BRWA five-year bond and a government of Romania
                           30-year bond, with details as shown in Exhibit 6. Assume that both bonds are denom-

                               The total market value for the portfolio is $99,011,224, and the portfolio is nearly
                           evenly weighted in terms of market value between the two bonds. As noted previ-
                           ously, duration and convexity for a portfolio are calculated as the weighted average
                           of the statistics for the individual bonds, with the shares of overall portfolio market
                           value as the weights. This weighted average approximates the theoretically correct
                           portfolio duration and convexity and becomes more accurate when differences in the
                           yields-to-maturity on the bonds are smaller and when the yield curve is flat.
                               Given the portfolio weights in this simple example, portfolio duration and con-
                           vexity are calculated as follows:
                               Weighted-average modified duration = (4.58676 × 0.5050) + (15.90637 × 0.4950)
                               = 10.19004.

                               Weighted-average convexity = (24.23896 × 0.5050) + (369.64203 × 0.4950)
                               = 195.21581.
                           The main advantage of this weighted-average approach is that it is easily used as a
                           measure of interest rate risk. For instance, if yields-to-maturity on each of the bonds
                           in the portfolio increase by 100 bps, then the estimated decline in the portfolio value
                           is 9.214%.
                               %∆PVFull ≈ (–10.19004 × 0.0100) + [½ × 195.21581 × (0.0100)2] = –9.21396%.
                           However, this approach also comes with a limitation: These measures of portfolio
                           duration and convexity implicitly assume that yields of all maturities change by the
                           same amount in the same direction, a parallel shift in the yield curve. In reality, pure
                           parallel shifts are rare; rather, we frequently observe a steepening, flattening, or even
                           twisting yield curve.

  1. Calculate the weighted-average duration and convexity for the proposed
     portfolio.
     Solution:
     Given the data in Exhibit 7, the weighted-average modified duration and
     convexity are calculated as follows:
      Weighted-average modified duration = (4.58676 × 0.33762) + (15.90637 ×
      0.33094) + (9.23693 × 0.33144)
      = 9.87415.

      Weighted-average convexity = (24.23896 × 0.33762) + (369.64203 × 0.33094)
      + (93.87376 × 0.33144)
      = 161.62749.


  2. Compare and interpret duration and convexity for the proposed portfolio
     versus the current portfolio.
     Solution:
     Adding the US Treasury position would decrease both the portfolio duration
     (from 10.19004 to 9.87415) and convexity (from 195.21581 to 161.62749).
     The reduction in duration would reduce the price risk of the portfolio
     against an upward parallel shift in the yield curve, but due to the lower con-
     vexity, this reduction in risk would be lessened for large shifts.

                                 investor expects a 100 bp parallel shift downward in yields.
                                 Solution:
                                 Given an expected 100 bp parallel shift down in yields, the investor should
                                 not add the position in US Treasury bonds. Adding the position lowers both
                                 the portfolio duration and convexity, which would also reduce the expected
                                 increase in the value of the portfolio. Given the investor’s yield curve view, it
                                 should seek to increase both portfolio duration and convexity.

                                                                        ​




                              1. Calculate the weighted-average modified duration for the portfolio.
                                 Solution:
                                 The market value of the bonds are as follows:
                                  Zero-coupon: €10,000,000 × 83.18777/100 = €8,318,777.

                                  Semi-annual: €10,000,000 × 105.91556/100 = €10,591,556.
                                 Therefore, the weights are 43.991% for the zero-coupon bond and 56.009%
                                 for the semi-annual bond. As a result, the weighted-average modified dura-
                                 tion is
                                  (4.81928 × 0.43991) + (7.71210 × 0.56009) = 6.43953.


                              2. Calculate the weighted-average convexity for the portfolio.
                                 Solution:
                                 Using the weights calculated previously,
                                  Weighted-average convexity = (27.87052 × 0.43991) + (72.54897 × 0.56009)
                                  = 52.89463.


                              3. Calculate the estimated percentage price change of the portfolio given a 100
                                 bp increase in yield-to-maturity on each of the bonds.

Portfolio Duration and Convexity                                                       311


      %∆PVFull ≈ (–6.43953 × 0.0100) + [½ × 52.89463 × (0.0100)2] = –6.1751%.


  4. Based on rising inflation and tightening monetary policy, the investor ex-
     pects interest rates to rise. Given that view, which bond should the investor
     consider replacing the 10-year bond with?
      A. A 20-year bond
      B. A 15-year floating-rate bond
      C. A 10-year bond with a lower coupon
     Solution:
     B is correct. With interest rates expected to rise, the investor should choose
     a bond with lower interest rate risk. Both the 20-year bond and the 10-year
     bond with a lower coupon should have higher durations than the current
     10-year bond, all else equal, and would be expected to experience a larger
     percentage price decrease if interest rates increase. Floating-rate bonds,
     however, have low interest rate risk because coupon payments adjust to
     changing interest rates.

                               PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                           1. A 5.5% semiannual-pay fixed-coupon bond is issued at par on 1 May 2025 and
                              matures on 1 May 2029. For a 5 bps increase and decrease in yield-to-maturity,
                              PV+ and PV– are 98.245077 and 101.792534, respectively. The approximate con-
                              vexity is closest to:
                               A. 3.548.

                               B. 15.045.

                               C. 101.793.

                           2. A bond pays a semiannual fixed coupon of 4.75%. It trades at par on its coupon
                              date of 16 December 2025 and matures on 16 December 2033. The bond’s annu-
                              alized convexity statistic is closest to:
                               A. 51.670.

                               B. 53.231.

                               C. 206.681.

                           3. For changes in yield-to-maturity, the convexity adjustment is most needed to
                              account for the:
                               A. first-order effect on bond prices.

                               B. bond price risk due to small changes in yield-to-maturity.

                               C. non-linear relationship of bond prices and yield to maturity.

                           4. If the yield-to-maturity of Bond X increases by 50 bps, the expected percentage
                              price change of Bond X is closest to:
                               A. –1.792%.

                               B. –1.812%.

                               C. –1.832%.

                           5. Given a 75 bps change in the yields-to-maturity for Bonds Y and Z, the convexity
                              adjustment for Bond Z would be greater than the convexity adjustment of Bond

   convexity, the portfolio should outperform its benchmark in which of the follow-
   ing scenarios?
   A. Only when interest rates are rising

   B. Only when interest rates are falling

   C. Both when interest rates are rising and falling

9. The method of using weighted-average portfolio duration and convexity mea-
   sures to assess price risk of a bond portfolio is best characterized as:
   A. being theoretically correct.

   B. being commonly used by portfolio managers.

   C. accommodating non-parallel shifts in the yield curve.

Annualized Convexity                                                                                           51.67034


                                 3. C is correct. The convexity adjustment is a complementary risk measure to
                                    duration. It accounts for the second-order (non-linear) effect of yield changes on
                                    price. It is most useful for large yield changes, because duration provides a good
                                    approximation for small yield changes.

                                 4. A is correct. The expected price change is calculated as follows:
                                        %ΔPVFull ≈ (–3.6239 × 0.005) + [½ × 16.2513 × (0.005)2]

   = –1.79164% ≈ –1.792%.

5. C is correct. Since the convexity adjustment uses the square of the change
   in yield, it is always positive regardless of the direction of the change in
   yield-to-maturity. As a result, the convexity adjustment for Bond Z will always
   be greater than the convexity adjustment for Bond Y, given the same change in
   yields-to-maturity.

6. C is correct.
   MoneyDur ≈ 9.0036 × 5,000,000 = 45,018,000

   MoneyCon ≈ 91.0278 × 5,000,000 = 455,139,000

   ΔPVFull ≈ –(45,018,000 × 0.01) + [½ × 455,139,000 × (0.01)2] = –GBP427,423.

7. B is correct. The portfolio weights for Bonds X, Y, and Z are 0.25, 0.25, and 0.50,
   respectively. The weighted average duration and convexity measures are calculat-
   ed as follows:
   Weighted-average duration = (0.25 × 3.6239) + (0.25 × 9.0036) + (0.50 × 12.7512)
   = 9.5325.

   Weighted-average convexity = (0.25 × 16.2513) + (0.25 × 91.0278) + (0.50 ×
   179.8591)
   = 116.7493.

   %ΔPVFull ≈ (–9.5325 × 0.01) + [½ × 116.7493 × (0.01)2] = –8.9487% ≈ –8.949%.

8. C is correct. The portfolio has a weighted-average duration of 9.5325, which is
   identical to the benchmark’s duration. However, the portfolio has higher convexi-
   ty (116.7493) compared to the benchmark (103.0677). All else equal, the portfolio
   should outperform the lower-duration benchmark portfolio in both rising and
   falling interest rate environments.

9. B is correct. The weighted-average portfolio duration and convexity method
   is easy to calculate and apply in practice and is commonly used by portfolio
   managers to assess bond portfolio price risk. It does, however, implicitly assume
   parallel shifts in the yield curve. Using the weighted average of time to receipt of
   the aggregate cash flows is the theoretically correct method to calculate portfolio
   duration and convexity, but it is difficult to use in practice.

INTRODUCTION
Having covered yield-based duration and convexity measures, we now introduce
                                                                                            1
curve-based measures of a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in a benchmark yield
curve and when cash flows are uncertain. We show how the change in a bond’s full
price is estimated by combining curve-based duration and convexity sensitivity mea-
sures, discuss uses of these approximate measures by issuers and investors, and explain
their benefits and limitations. We also introduce key rate duration as a measure of
interest rate risk across the term structure. Finally, we show that benchmark yield
changes and credit spreads for issuers of lower credit quality are negatively correlated,
especially during periods of market distress, establishing the benefit of an empirical
versus analytical approach.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Yield duration and convexity estimates of interest rate risk are
           useful only for small changes in yields. Effective duration and
           effective convexity are valid for both small and large changes in yields.

                                  ■    Effective duration and effective convexity are useful for gauging the
                                       interest rate risk of bonds whose future cash flows are uncertain.
                                  ■    Effective duration and effective convexity can be used to estimate the
                                       percentage change in a bond’s full price for a given shift in the bench-
                                       mark yield curve.
                                  ■    A key rate (or partial) duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to a
                                       change in the benchmark yield at a specific maturity. Key rate dura-
                                       tion data, along with forecasted shifts in the benchmark curve, allow a
                                       portfolio to be rebalanced to improve its return.
                                  ■    The sum of weighted key rate durations of the bonds in a portfolio are
                                       equal to the effective duration of the entire portfolio.
                                  ■    Analytical duration and convexity are estimated duration and con-
                                       vexity statistics using mathematical formulas. Empirical duration and
                                       convexity are estimated using historical data that incorporate various
                                       factors affecting bond prices.
                                  ■    When deciding whether to use an empirical or analytical measure,
                                       the correlation between benchmark yields and credit spreads must be
                                       considered.

                              These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                              of understanding of the learning module.

                              1. For which of the following-fixed income instruments would an investor most
                                 likely use yield duration and convexity to measure interest rate risk rather
                                 than effective duration and effective convexity?
                                  A. 30-year fixed-rate bond
                                  B. Callable bond
                                  C. Mortgage-backed security
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. The callable bond and mortgage-backed security have embed-
                                 ded options, which yield duration and convexity cannot account for. The
                                 30-year fixed-rate bond does not, so either method could be applied.

                              2. Calculate the effective duration of a bond given the following:

                                  ■    PV0 = 102.208.
                                  ■    Price with the benchmark yield curve shifted up 25 bps: PV+ =
                                       100.004.

                                       103.891.

Introduction                                                                                                      319


  3. Calculate the effective convexity of a bond given the following:

      ■     PV0 = 102.208.
      ■     Price with the benchmark yield curve shifted up 25 bps: PV+ =
            100.004.
      ■     Price with the benchmark yield curve shifted down by 25 bps: PV– =
            103.891.
     Solution:

                         ​[​(103.891)​+ (​ 100.004)​]​− [​ 2 × (​ 102.208)​]​
                 _____________________________

      EffCon = −815.592


  4. If the benchmark yield curve shifted by 50 bps, what would be the percent-
     age change in the full price of a bond if its effective duration is 6.094 and its
     effective convexity is –230.097?
     Solution:

            ​ ​Full​ ≈ (​ − EffDur × ΔCurve)​+ [​ _
      	​%ΔP V                                     ​21 ​× EffCon × ​(ΔCurve)​2​]​

            ​ ​Full​ ≈ (​ − 6.094 × 0.005)​+ [​ _

      %ΔPVFull ≈ 3.33%


  5. The table below contains forecasts of expected changes in the benchmark
     yield curve by tenor.
                                                                       ​

     Your portfolio contains equally sized positions in Bond A and Bond B,
     which have the following key rate durations.

     Given the information and expected changes in yields, identify the bond
     that could be sold to improve returns.
     Solution:
     Bond B, because its expected price decline from the expected change in
     benchmark yields is more than twice that of Bond A.
     For Bond A, ∆PV/PV = –1.706 × 0.015 = –2.56%.
     For Bond B, ∆PV/PV = –3.195 × 0.020 = –6.39%.

                              6. Explain why yield duration and convexity are less useful for bonds with con-
                                 tingency features, such as callable bonds.
                                 Solution:
                                 Yield duration and convexity assume cash flows are received on scheduled
                                 dates. Cash flows from bonds with contingency features may not be received
                                 on scheduled dates—if, for example, a callable bond is called by the issuer
                                 following a decrease in interest rates. Therefore, yield duration and convexi-
                                 ty would not correctly measure the price sensitivity to interest rates.

                              7. When comparing analytical duration versus empirical duration, which of
                                 the following statements is correct?
                                  A. Analytical duration and convexity are estimated duration and convex-
                                     ity statistics using mathematical formulas.
                                  B. Empirical duration and convexity are estimated using historical data in
                                     non-statistical models that incorporate various factors affecting bond
                                     prices.
                                  C. Both A and B
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. Analytical duration and convexity are estimated duration and
                                 convexity statistics using mathematical formulas.
                                 B is incorrect because statistical models are primarily used to determine
                                 empirical duration and convexity.
                                 C is incorrect because B is incorrect.

                              8. True or false: Analytical duration is superior to empirical duration for bonds
                                 with credit risk.
                                 Solution:
                                 False. If government bond yields are driven lower in a market stress scenar-
                                 io, the “flight to safety” will also cause credit spreads to widen because of
                                 an increase in expected default risk. Since credit spreads and benchmark
                                 yields are negatively correlated under this scenario, wider credit spreads will
                                 partially or fully offset the decline in government benchmark yields, result-
                                 ing in lower empirical duration estimates than analytical duration estimates.
                                 Therefore, empirical duration estimates are a more accurate method of
                                 forecasting bond price changes for bonds with credit risk.




              2            CURVE-BASED INTEREST RATE RISK MEASURES

                                         explain why effective duration and effective convexity are the most
                                         appropriate measures of interest rate risk for bonds with embedded
                                         options

                           Yield duration and convexity assume a bond’s cash flows are certain. However, if a
                           bond has contingency features, such as embedded options, as with a callable (or put-
                           table) bond, then future cash flows are uncertain since option exercise depends on
                           the level of market interest rates relative to coupon interest being paid (or received).

Curve-Based Interest Rate Risk Measures                                                       321


For example, the duration of a callable bond does not reflect the sensitivity of the
bond price to a change in the yield-to-worst, since this represents only one of several
possible outcomes based on future interest rates.
    Consequently, bonds with embedded options do not have well-defined
yields-to-maturity, so Macaulay and modified durations are not appropriate interest
rate risk measures for such bonds. Rather, the appropriate measure of interest rate
risk is the sensitivity of the bond’s price to a change in a benchmark yield curve—for
example, the government par curve—known as effective duration, a curve duration
rather than a yield duration statistic.
    Exhibit 1 shows the impact of an instantaneous change in the benchmark yield
curve (ΔCurve) on the price of a callable bond compared with that on a comparable
non-callable bond. The two bonds have the same features (i.e., coupon rate, payment
frequency, time-to-maturity, and credit risk). Note that the horizontal axis is a bench-
mark yield—a point on the par curve for government bonds.

The price of the non-callable bond is always greater than that of the comparable call-
able bond. The difference is the value of the embedded call option, which is held by
the bond issuer (not the investor). When interest rates are high relative to the coupon
rate, the value of the call option is low. When rates are low, the value of the call option
is high since the issuer is more likely to exercise the option to refinance the debt at
the lower prevailing rates. The investor bears the “call risk” since if the bond is called,
the investor must reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate.
    Exhibit 1 shows that, given parallel shifts in the benchmark yield curve, when
benchmark yields are high (ΔCurve is positive), the effective durations of the callable
and non-callable bonds are very similar. But when interest rates are low (ΔCurve is
negative), the effective duration of the callable bond is lower than that of the otherwise
comparable non-callable bond, since the callable bond price does not increase as much
when benchmark yields fall; the presence of the call option limits price appreciation.
Thus, an embedded call option reduces the effective duration of the bond, especially
when interest rates are falling and the bond is more likely to be called. The lower
effective duration can be interpreted as a shorter expected life—a reduced weighted
average of time to receipt of cash flow.
    Analogous to effective duration, the second-order effect of a parallel shift in the
benchmark yield curve is measured by effective convexity, a curve convexity statistic.
In Exhibit 1, as the benchmark yield declines, the slope of the line tangent to the curve

                           for the non-callable bond steepens, indicating positive convexity. But the slope of the
                           line tangent to the callable bond flattens as the benchmark yield declines and reaches
                           an inflection point, after which the effective convexity becomes negative.
                               When the benchmark yield is high and the value of the embedded call option is low,
                           the callable and the non-callable bonds experience very similar effects from interest
                           rate changes and both have positive convexity. But as the benchmark yield declines, the
                           curves diverge, and at some point, the callable bond moves into the range of negative
                           convexity, since the embedded call option has more value to the issuer and is more
                           likely to be exercised. This situation further limits the potential price appreciation of
                           the bond arising from lower benchmark yields.
                               Exhibit 2 shows characteristics of a bond with an embedded put option.

                                                                                  ∆Curve         ∆Curve        Benchmark yield




                           A putable bond allows the investor to sell the bond back to the issuer before maturity,
                           usually at par value, protecting the investor from higher benchmark yields that would
                           otherwise drive the bond’s price below par. So, the price of a putable bond is always
                           higher than that of an otherwise comparable non-putable bond, the price difference
                           being the value of the embedded put option.
                               An embedded put option reduces the effective duration of the bond, especially
                           when rates are rising. Given a parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve, if interest
                           rates are low compared to the coupon rate, the value of the put option is low and
                           the impact of a change in the benchmark yield on the bond’s price is very similar to
                           that for a non-putable bond. But when benchmark interest rates rise, the put option
                           becomes more valuable to the investor, since the ability to sell the bond back to the
                           issuer at par limits the price depreciation as rates rise. Importantly, putable bonds
                           always have positive effective convexity.
                               Effective duration and effective convexity are also relevant for mortgage-backed
                           securities (MBSs), which arise from a residential (or commercial) loan portfolio
                           securitization and are covered in later lessons. MBS cash flows are contingent on
                           homeowners’ ability to refinance or pay off an existing mortgage with the proceeds
                           from a new mortgage. Refinancing is a common feature of mortgages in the United
                           States and some other jurisdictions that borrowers tend to exercise if interest rates fall.
                               Calculating effective duration (EffDur) is very similar to calculating approximate
                           modified duration, as shown in Equation 1.

The formula for calculating effective convexity (EffCon) is also very similar to the
formula for approximate convexity, as shown in Equation 2.
                      [(P ​V−​ ​) + (P ​V+​ ​) ] − [2 × (P ​V0​ ​) ]

                                               ​ 0​ ​)

The differences are that ΔCurve is in the denominator—since effective duration is a
curve duration statistic, it measures interest rate risk in terms of a parallel shift in the
benchmark yield curve—and that PV– and PV+ are calculated using option pricing
models. These models are covered in more detail in later modules but include such
inputs as (1) the length of the call protection period, (2) the schedule of call prices
and call dates, (3) an assumption about credit spreads over benchmark yields (which
also includes any liquidity spread), (4) an assumption about future interest rate vol-
atility, and (5) the level of market interest rates (e.g., the government par curve). The
analyst holds the first four inputs constant and then raises and lowers the fifth input
(i.e., parallel shifts) to derive PV+ and PV–, respectively.
     Although effective duration and effective convexity are the appropriate interest
rate risk measure for bonds with embedded options, they may also be useful with
option-free bonds to supplement yield duration. Importantly, small differences may
arise between a bond’s effective duration and its modified duration because when the
government par curve is shifted in the model, the government spot (i.e., zero) curve is
also shifted, but not in the same parallel manner. Thus, the change in the bond price
is not the same as it would be if its yield-to-maturity changed by the same amount
as the change in the par curve.
     In general, modified duration and effective duration on an option-free bond are
not identical. However, the difference narrows when the yield curve is flatter, the
time-to-maturity is shorter, and the bond is priced closer to par value; the difference
disappears only in the rare circumstance of a flat yield curve.
     For example, consider BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% (semiannual) coupon bond priced
at par for settlement on 15 October 2025 and maturity on 15 October 2030. Using
PV0 = 100.00 and ∆Yield = 0.0005, in an earlier lesson, we found
   PV+ = 99.771 and PV– = 100.230,
   resulting in yield duration and convexity statistics as follows:
   ApproxModDur = 4.587 and ApproxCon = 24.239.
Instead of a change in the bond’s yield-to-maturity, assume there is an upward and
downward shift of the benchmark government par curve (∆Curve) by 5 bps, which
causes spot rates to move in a slightly non-parallel manner. Using PV0 = 100.00 and
∆Curve = 0.0005 and assuming the following new prices,
   PV+ = 99.760 and PV– = 100.241,
then using Equation 1, effective duration is 4.816:

                              When the government par curve is raised and lowered by 25 bps, the new full
                              prices for this callable bond from your option valuation model are 99.050 and
                              102.891, respectively. Therefore,
                                  ■     PV0 = 101.060,
                                  ■     PV+ = 99.050,
                                  ■     PV– = 102.891, and
                                  ■     ΔCurve = 0.0025.

QUESTION SET


  1. Match each scenario to the interest rate risk measures below.
                                                       ​




                        Scenario                                 Interest rate risk measure

    A. Bond’s percentage price change given                Money duration
    a change in its yield-to-maturity
    B. Linear approximation of the bond’s                  Modified duration
    price change in currency, given a 1%
    change in yield
    C. Callable bond                                       Effective duration
                                                       ​




     Solution:
     The match for A is modified duration. Modified duration is used to estimate
     the percentage price change given a change in yield-to-maturity.
     The match for B is money duration. Money duration expresses modified
     duration in currency units, which can be used to estimate the currency unit
     change in the position of a bond.
     The match for C is effective duration. Callable bonds have uncertain future
     cash flows with respect to future interest rates. Therefore, a curve duration
     statistic, such as effective duration, would be best to measure interest rate
     risk.

  Questions 2–5 relate to the following information:
     As a member of a fixed-income team, you are asked to examine pricing data
  for a Viviyu Inc. callable bond. The current full price, the price assuming the
  benchmark yield curve shifts up 25 bps, and the price assuming the benchmark
  yield curve shifts down by 25 bps, are as follows:
      ■    PV0 = 102.208,
      ■    PV+ = 100.004, and
      ■    PV– = 103.891.

                                 Explain whether the updated data would increase or decrease the value of
                                 effective duration.
                                 Solution:
                                 There is no need to recalculate the effective duration. Since the updated
                                 PV+ value is larger than the prior one, with all else constant, the numerator
                                 would be lower; thus, effective duration would decrease.

                                  ■     PV0 = 102.208,
                                  ■     PV+ = 98.504,
                                  ■     PV– = 103.891, and
                                  ■     ΔCurve = 0.0025.

                                 the effective duration. Explain what negative effective convexity implies.

                                 Negative effective convexity implies that the bond price will decline by a
                                 greater amount with an upward shift in benchmark yield than it will in-
                                 crease with a decline in the benchmark yield.

                           DURATION AND CONVEXITY

                                               calculate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified
                                               change in benchmark yield, given the bond’s effective duration and
                                               convexity

                           As we have seen, effective duration and effective convexity are curve-based metrics
                           that are useful for gauging the interest rate risk of complex instruments—such as those
                           with embedded contingency provisions—whose future cash flows are uncertain. These
                           metrics are typically determined from bond prices derived using an option valuation
                           model, given specific (parallel) changes in the underlying benchmark government
                           yield curve.
                               Just as with yield-based interest rate risk measures, effective duration and effective
                           convexity can be used to estimate the percentage change in a bond’s full price for a
                           given shift in the benchmark yield curve (∆Curve), as shown in Equation 3.

Let’s return to BRWA’s five-year, 3.2% (semiannual) coupon bond priced at par for
settlement on 15 October 2025 and maturity on 15 October 2030. Using Equation 3
and previously derived effective duration and effective convexity,
   EffDur = 4.816 and EffCon = 26.723,
the percentage changes in the bond’s full price for ±100 bp shifts in the benchmark
government par curve are estimated as follows:
   %∆PVFull ≈ (–4.816 × 0.01) + [½ × 26.723 × (0.01)2] = –4.68%.

   %∆PVFull ≈ (–4.816 × –0.01) + [½ × 26.723 × (–0.01)2] = 4.95%.
These bond price changes compare with the previously derived estimates of –4.47%
and 4.71% for this BRWA bond when using ApproxModDur alone and ApproxModDur
and ApproxCon, respectively, with yield-to-maturity changes of ±100 bps.
    As noted earlier, the differences in results using the curve-based measures versus
the yield-based interest rate risk measures are due to slightly different bond prices
(PV+ and PV–) and, therefore, EffDur and EffCon metrics (versus ApproxModDur
and ApproxCon metrics) since a parallel shift in the government par curve produces
a non-parallel shift in spot (zero) rates and one-year forward rates.
    Curve-based interest rate risk measures are important for both issuers and inves-
tors. For example, as noted previously, for a callable bond, when the benchmark
curve shifts downward and interest rates are low relative to the bond’s coupon rate,
effective duration declines and effective convexity may even turn from positive to
negative. From an investor’s perspective, these results severely limit the bond’s price
appreciation in a declining interest rate environment. From the issuer’s perspective,
the bonds can be bought back at the call price and refinanced at lower market rates.
    As for a putable bond, when the benchmark curve shifts upward and interest
rates are high relative to the bond’s coupon rate, both effective duration and effective
convexity decline (but effective convexity always remains positive), which, from an
investor’s perspective, limits the bond’s price depreciation in a rising interest rate
environment. This is because the investor can sell the bonds back to issuer at the put
price (typically par), rather than at a discounted price, and reinvest the proceeds at
the higher prevailing market rates.
    A practical consideration in using effective duration and effective convexity is set-
ting the change in the benchmark yield curve. With approximate modified duration,
accuracy is improved by choosing a smaller yield-to-maturity change. The pricing
models used for more complex securities, such as callable bonds issued by corpora-
tions and asset-backed securities (ABSs), include assumptions about the behavior of
corporate issuers or the borrowers whose loans make up the underlying ABS assets
under different interest rate scenarios. For example, a corporate issuer’s decision
to call a bond and refinance depends in part on issuer-specific credit spreads. For
mortgage borrowers, changes in the value of the underlying asset financed will affect
the decision to refinance a mortgage and therefore call an MBS bond. Therefore,
estimates of interest rate risk using effective duration and effective convexity are not
necessarily improved by choosing a smaller change in benchmark rates. Curve-based
interest rate risk measures have become an important tool in the financial analysis of
not only traditional bonds but also financial liabilities.

                                  In discussing these results with the PM, you conclude that the negative effec-
                              tive convexity adds to the bond’s price decline when benchmark rates increase
                              and subtracts from the bond’s price rise when benchmark rates decrease. If the
                              PM’s forecast is an equal probability that the benchmark par curve will increase
                              or decrease, the PM would not invest. However, if the PM’s forecast is that the
                              probability for the benchmark decreasing is greater, such that expected gain is
                              greater than zero, she may decide to invest in the bond.


                            QUESTION SET

                              Questions 1–5 relate to the following information:
                              As a fixed-income analyst, you are asked to consider the impact of the benchmark
                              government par curve shifting upward by 200 bps on two bonds, as part of an
                              internal stress scenario. From a bond pricing model, the following information
                              on effective duration and effective convexity were obtained.
                                 Bond A: Effective duration = 9.369; Effective convexity = –353.752.
                                 Bond B: Effective duration = 8.517; Effective convexity = –321.756.

                              1. Calculate the estimated percentage change in the full price of bond A for the
                                 200 bps curve shift.
                                 Solution:

                                        ​ ​Full​ ≈ (​ − EffDur × ΔCurve)​+ [​ _

                                        ​ ​Full​ ≈ (​ − 9.369 × 0.02)​+ [​ _

                                  %ΔPVFull ≈ −25.81%.


                              2. Calculate the estimated percentage change in the full price of Bond B for the
                                 200 bps curve shift.
                                 Solution:

                                        ​ ​Full​ ≈ (​ − EffDur × ΔCurve)​+ [​ _
                                  	​%ΔP V                                     ​21 ​× EffCon × ​(ΔCurve)​2​]​.​

                                        ​ ​Full​ ≈ (​ − 8.517 × 0.02)​+ [​ _
                                  	​%ΔP V                                  ​12 ​× − 321.756 × ​(0.02)​2​]​.​

                                  %ΔPVFull ≈ −23.47%.

  3. Based on Questions 1 and 2, if both bonds were in a portfolio and a decision
     to sell one of them had to be made in light of a forecast of sharply rising
     interest rates, recommend Bond A or Bond B to sell. Justify your answer.
     Solution:
     Sell Bond A since it has the more negative percentage change in the full
     price of the bond. For every 200 bps increase in the benchmark curve, the
     full price of the bond drops 25.81%.

  4. If you were forecasting the benchmark yield curve to shift downward by 200
     basis points, recommend Bond A or Bond B to add to the portfolio in antici-
     pation of the curve shift. Justify your answer.
     Solution:
     Add Bond A, since when you calculate the percentage change in the full
     price for Bonds A and B, Bond A has the higher positive percentage change.
      %∆PVFull Bond A ≈ (–8.517 × –0.02) + [½ × –321.756 × (–0.0200)2]
      = 11.66%.

      %∆PVFull Bond B ≈ (–8.517 × –0.02) + [½ × –321.756 × (–0.0200)2]
      = 10.60%.


  5. Explain why the estimated percentage change in the price of the bond from
     a 200 bps upward shift in the benchmark yield curve is more than twice the
     estimated percentage change in the price of the bond from a 200 bps down-
     ward yield curve shift.
     Solution:
     Because effective convexity is negative, an upward shift in the yield curve
     results in a higher absolute price change than a downward shift in the yield
     curve. For the upward shift, the duration contribution is positive and con-
     vexity contribution is negative, offsetting each other.




KEY RATE DURATION AS A MEASURE OF YIELD CURVE
RISK                                                                                       4
              define key rate duration and describe its use to measure price
              sensitivity of fixed-income instruments to benchmark yield curve
              changes

As we have seen, effective duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to changes in the
benchmark yield curve if all yields change by the same amount. Key rate duration
provides further insight into a bond’s sensitivity to non-parallel benchmark yield curve
changes. Key rate duration (or partial duration) is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to
a change in the benchmark yield at a specific maturity. Such a measure is important
to isolate the price responses of bonds to changes in the rates of key maturities on
the benchmark yield curve.

                              Key rate durations define a security’s price sensitivity over a set of maturities
                           along the yield curve, with the sum of key rate durations being equal to the effective
                           duration, as shown in Equations 4 and 5:

                               	​KeyRateDu ​r​k​ = − ​_1    _    ΔPV
                                                      PV ​× ​Δ ​r​ ​​ ;​

                                                                                                              (4)

                                n

                               k=1

                               where rk represents the kth key rate. In contrast to effective duration, key rate
                           durations help identify “shaping risk” for a bond—that is, a bond’s sensitivity to
                           changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve (e.g., the yield curve becoming
                           steeper or flatter or twisting).
                               The procedure for the calculation of key rate durations is similar to that used in
                           the calculation of effective duration, but instead of shifting the entire benchmark yield
                           curve, only key points on the curve are shifted, one at a time, as shown in Exhibit 3.
                           The kth key rate, which could be a 0.5-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, or 30-year rate, is shifted up
                           (as shown in Exhibit 3) and down by 1 bp, and then new bond prices are generated
                           (PV+ and PV–) and the key rate duration at that specific maturity is calculated using
                           Equation 4. Thus, the effective duration for each maturity point shift is calculated in
                           isolation.

As for practical uses of key rate duration, the analyst may want to know how the price
of a callable bond is expected to change if short-term benchmark rates—for example,
the rate on the two-year Treasury note, with modified duration of 1.99—rise by 25 bps
but longer-maturity benchmark rates remain unchanged. Given that the yield curve
is upward sloping, this scenario represents a flattening of the curve.
    Equation 6 rearranges terms from Equation 4 to solve for ∆PV/PV (or %∆PVFull):
   _ ΔPV
   	​ PV ​ = − KeyRateDu r​ ​k​× Δ ​r​k​.​	                                                      (6)

Using Equation 6, the expected estimated price change would be -0.4975%:
   ∆PV/PV = –1.99 × 0.0025.
Now, consider the simple portfolio of government bonds shown in Exhibit 5.

Assume the portfolio is weighted by the prices of the respective 2-, 5-, and 10-year
bonds for a total portfolio value of $293 million, or $1 million × (99.50 + 98.31 +
95.43). The portfolio’s modified duration is calculated as
   5.345 = [1.991 × (99.5/293.2)] + [4.869 × (98.3/293.2)] + [9.333 × (95.4/293.2)].
Alternatively, we could calculate each key rate duration by maturity. For example, the
two-year key rate duration (KeyRateDur2) is
   0.676 = 1.991 × (99.5/293.2).
Note that the three key rate duration values sum to the portfolio duration value of 5.345.
    If we assume this portfolio represents an “index,” then a manager attempting to
outperform the index could vary (or tilt) the key rate durations to capitalize on her
view of expected changes in the shape of the benchmark yield curve, as demonstrated
in the following example.

                              the bond portfolio may need rebalancing to improve overall return, given the
                              tenor of the portfolio’s bonds, key rate duration information, and forecasted

                              Therefore, since the forecasted price change in the bonds favor Bonds B and C,
                              it would be advisable to increase the weightings for these bonds, taking more
                              from the Bond A position than the Bond D position, since Bond A is forecasted
                              to give the least gain of all the bonds.


                            QUESTION SET

                              Questions 1–3 relate to the following information.
                              The analysis you performed previously on the consideration of the impact of the
                              benchmark government par curve increasing by 200 bps on two bonds has now
                              been expanded for a more complicated scenario. You are asked to consider the
                              scenario of a non-parallel shift in the benchmark government par curve, where
                              a steepening of the curve is occurring at longer maturities. Below are the details
                              on non-parallel shifts to the benchmark government par curve:

     Relevant details on the two bonds are as follows:
                                            ​




                                       Tenor                 Key Rate Duration

    Bond A                             5 years                     2.702
    Bond B                            10 years                     3.953
                                            ​




  1. Based on the information above, identify which bond will have a greater
     percentage change in its price due to the benchmark par curve shift.
     Solution
     Bond B.
     For Bond A, ∆PV/PV = –2.702 × 0.015 = –4.05%.
     For Bond B, ∆PV/PV = –3.953 × 0.020 = –7.91%.

  2. If the values in the table above on the non-parallel yield curve shifts were
     forecasts and your portfolio contains equal positions in the two bonds,
     which of the following would be the best course of action?
      A. Sell Bond A.
      B. Sell Bond B.
      C. Sell both Bond A and Bond B.
     Solution
     C is correct. Sell both Bonds A and B, since both are expected to see price
     declines.

  3. Explain why key rate durations might be useful for a portfolio manager even
     though key rate duration values of the bonds in a portfolio sum to the port-
     folio duration.
     Solution
     Knowing the portfolio duration and overall movement of the benchmark
     yield curve can provide a quick estimate of gains or losses; however, by using
     key rate durations, a portfolio manager can over- or underweight specific
     tenors to maximize risk-adjusted return.




EMPIRICAL DURATION
                                                                                        5

               duration

The approaches taken so far to estimate duration and convexity statistics using math-
ematical formulas is often referred to as analytical duration; the measures we have
covered are summarized in Exhibit 6. Importantly, estimates of the impact of bench-
mark yield changes on bond prices using analytical duration implicitly assume that

                           However, in practice, there is another important type of duration: Fixed-income
                           professionals often use historical data in statistical models that incorporate various
                           factors affecting bond prices to calculate empirical duration estimates (see Exhibit 6).
                           These estimates are calculated over time and in different interest rate environments
                           to inform the fixed-income portfolio decision-making process.
                                For instance, during crises, investors typically sell risky assets and purchase gov-
                           ernment bonds. Such a “flight to quality” can cause government benchmark yields to
                           fall while credit spreads widen. Exhibit 7 depicts the flight to quality during the onset
                           of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of February 2020.

During such periods, we might expect analytical and empirical duration estimates to
differ. For a government bond with little or no credit risk, we would expect analytical
and empirical duration to be similar because benchmark yield changes largely drive
bond prices. Conversely, credit spreads (and liquidity spreads) would widen because
of an increase in expected default risk. Since credit spreads and benchmark yields
are negatively correlated under this scenario, wider credit spreads will partially or
fully offset the decline in government benchmark yields, resulting in lower empirical
duration estimates than analytical duration estimates (in other words, the expected
increase in a bond’s price from declining government benchmark yields is offset by a
decrease in price from widening credit spreads). Analysts must consider the correlation
between benchmark yields and credit spreads when deciding whether to use empirical
or analytical duration estimates.

EXAMPLE 4

  Viswan Family Office’s Corporate Bond Portfolio—
  Empirical vs. Analytical Duration
  In addition to equity holdings, the Viswan Family Office (VFO) manages a
  government bond portfolio and a corporate bond portfolio. Positions in the
  government bond portfolio are mainly medium-term US Treasury securities
  but also include debt of other highly rated developed-market sovereign issuers.
  About half of the corporate bond portfolio is invested in investment-grade issues,
  and the other half consists of high-yield issues, with a mix of maturities and a
  mix of North American, European, and Asian companies.
      Explain why empirical duration is likely to be a more relevant interest rate
  risk measure for VFO’s corporate bond portfolio than for its government bond
  portfolio.
      Solution:
      The government bond portfolio includes debt securities of the US government
  and other highly rated developed-market sovereign issuers. Since benchmark
  yields are the primary driver of changes in overall bond yields in this portfolio,
  the results of analytical duration and empirical duration should be broadly similar.
      The corporate bond portfolio includes a wide variety of debt securities with
  varying levels of credit quality and liquidity risk and, therefore, different credit
  and liquidity spreads.
      Correlations between benchmark yield changes and the sizes of the credit
  and liquidity spreads are negative, particularly during stressed market conditions,
  such that during such times, lower benchmark yields are more than offset by
  higher credit and liquidity spreads. So, for the lower-quality corporate bonds,
  yields increase, which makes their empirical duration significantly lower than
  their analytical duration.
      Consequently, empirical duration, not analytical duration, is the more accu-
  rate interest rate risk measure for the corporate bond portfolio.


QUESTION SET

     of the following statements is correct?
      A. Empirical duration and convexity are estimated duration and convexity

                                  B. Analytical duration and convexity are estimated using historical data
                                     in non-statistical models that incorporate various factors affecting
                                     bond prices.
                                  C. Neither A nor B
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct.
                                 A is incorrect because it is analytical, not empirical, duration and convexity
                                 that are measured using mathematical formulas.
                                 B is incorrect because it is empirical, not analytical, duration and convexity
                                 that are estimated using historical data in non-statistical models that incor-
                                 porate various factors affecting bond prices.

                              2. True or false: Empirical duration estimates provide better estimates than the
                                 analytical duration estimates for bonds that have credit risk.
                                 Solution:
                                 True. Macroeconomic factors drive government bond yields lower in a
                                 market stress scenario, and the flight to safety will cause high-yield bond
                                 credit spreads to widen because of an increase in expected default risk.
                                 Since credit spreads and benchmark yields are negatively correlated under
                                 this scenario, wider credit spreads will partially or fully offset the decline in
                                 government benchmark yields. Analytical duration, however, assumes that
                                 benchmark yields and spreads are uncorrelated. Empirical duration esti-
                                 mates are a more accurate method of forecasting for bonds with credit risk.

                              3. Identify some of the challenges that may be encountered in estimating em-
                                 pirical duration.
                                 Solution:
                                 Empirical duration estimation utilizes historical data based on multiple
                                 factors. What factors to use and not use, what weight to give the factors,
                                 and how to weight current data versus older data (e.g., the time period to
                                 measure duration) are some challenges.

                           6. The investor’s portfolio is diversified, and the fixed-income component of the
                              portfolio has bonds of various maturities, with a duration of 7.48621. What
                              would happen to the effective duration of the fixed-income component of the
                              investor’s portfolio if Bond A is added to the portfolio?
                               A. It would increase.

                               B. If would decrease.

                               C. It would stay the same.

                           7. For the two bonds under consideration, would analytical duration estimates or
                              empirical duration estimates be most appropriate in conducting your analysis?
                               A. Analytical duration estimates

                               B. Empirical duration estimates

                               C. Either type of estimate would be appropriate.

                           8. What impact would a “flight to safety” (i.e., government bond yields falling and
                              credit spreads widening) have on the analytical duration estimate of Bond A?
                               A. Decreased duration

                               B. Increased duration

                               C. No impact

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. Since Bond B is callable, it has an embedded option, and effective
   duration is the most appropriate duration measure. Effective duration also works
   on bonds without embedded options and would allow the analyst to compare the
   interest rate risk of the two bonds.

2. B is correct. Since the bond is callable, after a certain point on the yield curve,
   the issuer will exercise the call and the owner will not be able to realize additional
   gains from declines in the benchmark yield curve.

3. B is correct. Bond B is riskier since the 200 bps upward shift in the yield curve
   results in a greater percentage price decrease, owing to its negative effective
   convexity:
   %∆PVFull Bond A ≈ (–7.48621 × 0.0100) + [½ × 29.35972 × (–0.0100)2]
   = –7.33941%.

   %∆PVFull Bond B ≈ (–7.23853 × 0.0100) + [½ × –321.75618 × (0.0100)2]
   = –8.84730%.

4. A is correct. Typically, the effect of duration is much larger than the effect of
   convexity.
   %∆PVFull Bond A, Duration ≈ –7.48621 × 0.0200 = –14.97242%.

   %∆PVFull Bond A, Convexity Adjustment ≈ ½ × 29.35972 × (–0.0200)2
   = –0.58719%.

5. B is correct. Since both bonds mature in one year, key rate duration analysis
   would not give you any additional insight, since both bonds would undergo the
   same shift in the curve.

6. C is correct. Bond A has the same effective duration as the portfolio effective
   duration.

7. B is correct. Since both Bond A and Bond B are corporate bonds, they have credit
   risk, and as such, empirical duration would be the most appropriate because
   benchmark yields and credit spreads may not be positively correlated.

8. C is correct. There would be no impact on the analytical duration estimate. How-
   ever, an empirical duration estimate would be impacted. A flight to safety would
   result in an increase in the bond price due to the falling benchmark yield being
   offset by widening credit spread. This would lead to a lower empirical duration
   than analytical duration.

INTRODUCTION
Credit analysis plays a critical role in fixed-income markets. Proper evaluation and
                                                                                            1
pricing of credit risk facilitates the efficient allocation of capital. This is a dynamic
process as credit risk components are continuously re-evaluated and fixed-income
instruments repriced according to market conditions. This learning module covers
the basic principles of credit analysis. First, we introduce the concepts of credit risk
and expected loss and interpret what credit ratings mean. We compare bond issuer
creditworthiness within a given industry as well as across industries, and we explore
how financial markets price credit risk. This lesson focuses primarily on the analy-
sis of credit risk, while subsequent lessons discuss credit analysis of sovereign and
non-sovereign government issuers as well as corporate debt

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Credit risk is the risk of economic loss resulting from borrower
           failure to make full and timely payments of interest and prin-
           cipal. The key components of credit risk are the probability of default
           and the loss given default, and their product is expected loss.
       ■   Chief sources of credit risk include adverse macroeconomic condi-
           tions, a financing mismatch between resources and obligations, and
           issuer-specific factors in corporate and sovereign debt markets.
       ■   Nearly every bond issue in developed debt markets carries credit rat-
           ings classifying creditworthiness. Credit ratings enable comparisons of
           the credit risk of debt issues and issuers within and across industries.

                                  ■   Bonds or issuers with an investment-grade (IG) credit rating pose the
                                      lowest risk of default and are rated Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB– or
                                      higher by S&P and Fitch. In contrast, non-investment-grade or high-
                                      yield (HY) bonds or issuers are rated BB+ or lower by S&P/Fitch and
                                      Ba1 or less by Moody’s and represent substantial to very high credit
                                      risk.
                                  ■   Pitfalls of relying solely on credit ratings in making investment deci-
                                      sions include that rating agency decisions may lag market pricing of
                                      credit risk, overlook key financial risks, and/or involve miscalculations
                                      or unforeseen changes not fully captured in a rating agency’s for-
                                      ward-looking analysis.
                                  ■   The premium, or yield spread, at which corporate bonds trade relative
                                      to default risk-free assets widens when credit risk rises and narrows if
                                      credit risk falls.
                                  ■   Credit spread changes affect holding period returns via two primary
                                      factors: a) the basis point spread change and b) the sensitivity of price
                                      to yield as reflected by end-of-period modified duration and convexity.
                                      Spread narrowing increases holding period returns.



                            LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                              These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                              of understanding of this learning module.

                              1. Credit risk is:
                                 A. activated upon a borrower’s default.
                                 B. the spread an investor receives above the risk-free rate.
                                  C. experienced in several ways by lenders.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. Lenders are impacted by credit risk in several
                                 ways, including failure to receive principal and interest payments in a timely
                                 manner, the inability to sell collateral at a market price sufficient to meet an
                                 issuer’s obligations in the case of secured debt, or the potential incurrence of
                                 legal or other costs to collect debt. A is incorrect because while a borrower
                                 default initiates a realized loss, expected loss exists prior to the occurrence
                                 of any actual loss. B is incorrect because it refers to the credit spread, which
                                 compensates investors for assuming credit risk.

                              2. A EUR500,000 loan has the following characteristics:

                                  ■   Probability of default 5%
                                  ■   Collateral EUR100,000
                                  ■   Recovery rate 90%
                                  ■   Expected exposure EUR400,000


                                 The expected loss for this loan in event of default is:
                                 A. EUR1,500
                                 B. EUR2,000

Introduction                                                                            343


      C. EUR20,000
     Solution:
     The correct answer is A. We solve for expected loss (EL) as follows:
      EL = POD × (EE – Collateral) × (1 – RR).
     Since probability of default (POD) is 5%, expected exposure (EE) is
     EUR400,000, collateral is EUR100,000, and the recovery rate (RR) is 90%:
      EL = EUR1,500 = 0.05 × (400,000 – 100,000) × (1 – 0.9).
     B is incorrect as it fails to reduce the expected exposure by the collateral,
     while C is incorrect as it simply multiplies EE and POD.

  3. Credit ratings are:
      A. developed on behalf of investors.
      B. a symbol-based measure of the potential default risk of a bond issue or
         issuer.
      C. measures of credit risk that are used to determine bond market
         pricing.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B: Credit ratings are a symbol-based measure of the
     potential default risk of a bond issue or issuer. A is incorrect because credit
     ratings are developed on behalf of the issuer. C is incorrect because credit
     ratings are not used to determine bond prices.

  4. Which of the following statements best describes risks that are difficult to
     capture in credit ratings?
      A. Environmental risks are captured by ESG ratings rather than credit
         ratings.
      B. Debt-financed acquisitions are usually captured in credit ratings.
      C. Split ratings demonstrate that credit rating agencies may view complex
         risks very differently.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is C. A is incorrect as environmental risks may affect
     credit ratings. B is incorrect since debt-financed acquisitions are difficult to
     anticipate.

  5. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: Spreads are __________ at
     or near the top of the credit cycle, when market participants perceive credit
     risk to be at its lowest; they are __________ at or near the bottom of the
     credit cycle, when financial markets believe credit risk has reached its peak.
     Solution:
     Spreads are narrowest (or lowest) at or near the top of the credit cycle,
     when market participants perceive credit risk to be at its lowest; they are
     widest (or highest) at or near the bottom of the credit cycle, when financial
     markets believe credit risk has reached its peak.

     spreads will rise 100 bps in a recession. If an observed HY bond has modi-

                                 fied duration of 4.5 and reported convexity of 0.23, the expected change in
                                 the HY bond’s price under this scenario would be closest to:
                                 A. –4.5%.
                                 B. –4.385%.
                                  C. –4.615%.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. Bond price changes based upon modified duration,
                                 convexity, and the spread change are calculated as follows:
                                 %∆PVFull = −(AnnModDur × ∆Spread) + ½AnnConvexity × (∆Spread)2.
                                 With AnnModDur = 4.5 and reported convexity of 0.23, rescaling convexity
                                 to 23 and substituting values to solve for spread results in
                                 ∆PVFull = − (4.5 × 1.00%) + ½ (23) × (1.00%)2

                                 ∆PVFull = −4.385%.

                                         loss given default

                           Fixed-income investors face credit risk, a form of performance risk in a contractual
                           relationship. A borrower that fails to meet its promised interest and/or principal pay-
                           ment obligations under a bond or loan contract is said to be in default. A fixed-income
                           investor seeks compensation for the expected economic loss under a potential borrower
                           default over the life of the contract known as credit risk.
                               Credit risk depends upon specific factors related to the borrower itself as well as
                           general economic conditions and is subject to change over the life of the contract.
                           Credit risk exposes the lender or investor to potential losses and underperformance.
                               Traditionally, many analysts evaluated creditworthiness based on what are often
                           called the “Cs of credit analysis,” as shown in Exhibit 1:

                                      Bottom-Up Factors




Five of these criteria—capacity, capital, collateral, covenants, and character—are related
to the specific bottom-up factors applicable to an individual borrower. Capacity refers
to the ability of the borrower to make its debt payments on time. Capital addresses
other company resources available that reduce reliance on debt. Collateral refers to the
quality and value of the assets supporting the issuer’s indebtedness, while covenants
are the legal terms of debt agreements that an issuer must comply with. Character
refers to the quality of management and the willingness of repay indebtedness.
    While capacity and capital are generally quantitative metrics based on financial
statements, collateral, covenants, and character are largely qualitative measures that
analysts assess based on historical company performance, credit relationships and
the reputation of current management.
    The remaining three criteria—conditions, country, and currency—involve general
top-down factors that apply to all borrowers to a greater or lesser extent. Conditions
refers to the general economic, competitive, and business environment faced by all
borrowers that may affect their ability to service or refinance debt. Country involves
the geopolitical environment as well as the legal and political system faced by all issuers
in a jurisdiction that may affect debt payment. Currency affects issuers whose cash
flows are affected by exchange rate changes or who borrow in a currency outside of
their jurisdiction, such as sovereign issuers with foreign currency debt.
    A borrower’s inability to make timely payments may be due to several underlying
and contributing factors, but it ultimately results from a lack of sufficient cash available
to make a current debt payment. Lenders, as fixed-income investors, are impacted
by credit risk. They may lose some or all of the principal and interest due, suffering a
capital loss or income shortfall. This disruption to their cash flows may impact their
own ability to repay debt, and payment delays as well as increased legal and collection
costs may further reduce their income and margins.

                           Changes in credit risk due to issuer-based or overall economic conditions are affected
                           by the source of repayment, which differs among issuer types. Exhibit 2 shows the
                           main sources of repayment for corporate and sovereign bonds.

                           A corporation may not generate sufficient cash flow from its operations, financing
                           activities, and investments to make timely payments on its debt, increasing the risk of
                           default. Similarly, a sovereign borrower may not generate sufficient revenue through
                           taxes, incomes, and fees to make timely payments.
                               Borrowers that lack the resources to meet debt obligations as they come due
                           are often described as illiquid. An illiquid borrower is unable to raise the necessary
                           funds to fulfill a debt obligation. They may not be able to tap credit lines, sell assets,
                           or otherwise raise funding to make a timely debt payment. That is different from an
                           insolvent borrower whose assets are worth less than its liabilities. An illiquid borrower
                           just does not have, or is unable to secure, the liquidity needed to make timely payment.
                               Credit risk analysis focuses on understanding how a borrower generates cash,
                           how and when cash is used, and what events and risks may impede the borrower’s
                           ability to repay the debt. In earlier lessons, we encountered unsecured debt, where
                           the primary source of repayment is the cash flow generated by the business. In the
                           case of secured debt, the primary source of repayment remains the firm’s cash flows,
                           but it is also supported by collateral pledged by the company. The following example
                           involves an investor considering an unsecured bond versus a secured bond.

                              Risk Comparison of BRWA and VIVU Notes
                              The hypothetical car manufacturer Bright Wheel Automotive (BRWA) is an
                              investment-grade (IG) issuer with ready access to unsecured debt, while Vivivyu
                              Inc. (VIVU) is a hypothetical high-yield (HY) issuer that borrows on a secured
                              basis. Let us compare 3.2% senior unsecured and unsubordinated BRWA notes
                              to 6.5% secured unsubordinated VIVU notes. Consider BRWA’s debt profile:

        If BRWA fails to make an interest or principal payment on the note, BRWA
   is in default. Since its bonds are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations with
   pari passu and cross-default language in its bond indenture, failure to repay
   unsecured indebtedness means that all its debt obligations are in default and
   investors must rely on BRWA’s general asset pool to satisfy their obligations,
   as shown below.

                                 VIVU’s failure to make timely payments due on the note will also result in
                              default. The pari passu clause and cross-default language in its bond indenture
                              with other unsecured indebtedness also sends all VIVU debt obligations into
                              default. While all of VIVU’s debt investors have access to any unpledged assets,
                              specific pledged assets serve as a secondary source of repayment for specific
                              debt, as shown below.

                              debt including the callable notes are backed by a claim to specific long-term
                              assets pledged. As a secondary source of repayment, only when the value of the
                              pledged assets falls below the total amount of pari passu secured debt will VIVU
                              noteholders begin to suffer a credit loss.

                              BRWA, is typically well below that of a high-yield issuer such as VIVU, the
                              investor’s loss in the event of a default for secured debt is usually lower than
                              unsecured debt due to the secondary source of repayment for secured bonds.

                               We encountered the Government of Romania’s EUR1.95 billion 30-year debt issue
                           in an earlier lesson. For a sovereign government, the right to tax economic activity
                           within its borders means that the sources of repayment are the personal and corporate
                           income taxes, sales taxes, and other revenue generated by the government. In the

While many factors affect the primary and secondary sources of repayment for different
fixed-income issuers, investors seek to measure and compare credit risk among different
borrowers for similar maturities as well as across maturities for the same borrower.
    For example, consider the comparison of BRWA and VIVU notes in Example 1.
If we set aside both the VIVU maturity difference and call feature (which the issuer
may exercise any time from year three through maturity in year seven) by assuming
a similar expected maturity to the BRWA bond for the time being, compare the 6.5%
VIVU debt coupon to the 3.2% fixed rate of the BRWA bond. How can we assess
whether the additional 3.3% (= 6.5% − 3.2%) in interest adequately compensates an
investor for the additional risk? We turn to measures of credit risk, which help answer
this question in the next section.


Measuring Credit Risk
Fixed-income investors face credit risk, or the risk that an issuer does not make prom-
ised interest and principal payments. This probability-weighted shortfall known as
the expected loss (EL) for a given period has two components, as shown in Exhibit 4.

                           The first is known as the probability of default (POD), which is the likelihood that an
                           issuer fails to make full and timely payments of principal and interest. The probability
                           of default is typically an annualized measure.
                               The second component is the loss given default (LGD), or the investor’s loss
                           conditional on an issuer event of default. The loss given default combines the severity
                           of loss under a default scenario with the amount of the investor’s claim at the time
                           of default. The recovery rate (RR) represents the percentage of an outstanding debt
                           claim recovered when an issuer defaults, while the loss severity of (1 − RR) represents
                           the unrecovered portion of the claim. The size of the investor’s claim at the time of
                           default is known as the expected exposure (EE) or exposure at default (EAD). This
                           is the amount an investor may expect to lose in the case of default, which is usually
                           equal to the loan or bond face value plus accrued interest less the current market
                           value of available collateral. In most instances, in the event of default, bondholders
                           will usually recover some proportion of their investment.
                               The expected loss is shown in Equation 1:
                               EL = POD × LGD,                                                                                     (1)
                               where LGD = EE × (1 – RR).
                               The LGD can be expressed either in currency terms (e.g., EUR450,000) or as a
                           percentage of principal (e.g., 45%). The latter form of expression is more useful for
                           analysis since it allows comparison across borrowers and investments of different sizes.
                               One way to interpret the expected loss on a fixed-income security for a given
                           period is to compare it to the compensation an investor expects for taking on the
                           credit risk of a borrower over that period, which is the credit spread. Recall from an
                           earlier lesson that the G-spread is equal to yield spread in basis points over an actual
                           or interpolated government bond. This approximation may be expressed as follows:
                               Credit Spread ≈ POD × LGD.                                                                          (2)
                           Therefore, we can say that the investor is fairly compensated if the expected loss is
                           equal to the credit spread for a given period. The following example uses this infor-
                           mation to assess the expected loss versus compensation for the BRWA and VIVU
                           bonds from Example 1.

EXAMPLE 2

   Comparing Expected Loss and Credit Spreads
   Recall from Example 1 that Bright Wheel Automotive (BRWA) issued an unse-
   cured five-year bond with a 3.2% fixed coupon. The yield-to-maturity difference
   between BRWA’s five-year bond and the comparable US Treasury bond is 90 bps
   (= 3.2% – 2.3%), which reflects BRWA’s credit spread over Treasuries, known
   as the G-spread. Vivivyu Inc. (VIVU) issued a 6.5% fixed-rate bond, which the
   issuer has the right to call at a fixed price any time from three years from the
   issuance date until final maturity in seven years.

   1. Assuming the BRWA bond has a probability of default of 1% and a loss given
      default of 80%, estimate whether BRWA bond investors are adequately com-
      pensated for assuming BRWA credit risk.
      Solution:
      Using Equation 1, we may solve for BRWA’s expected loss in percentage
      terms as follows:
       EL = POD × LGD, or 0.8% = [0.01 × 80%].
      Given BRWA’s credit spread of 0.9%, we may conclude based upon the ap-
      proximation in Equation 2 that BRWA investors are fairly compensated for
      assuming the credit risk since:
       Credit Spread > POD × LGD.
      Investors earn a 90 bps spread per year and have an expected loss of 80 bps
      per year.

   2. If we assume that VIVU has issued a five-year non-callable bond, as in the
      case of BRWA, with a probability of default of 6% and a loss given default
      of 50%, compare investor compensation for assuming the credit risk of the
      6.5% VIVU debt coupon to that of the 3.2% fixed rate of the BRWA bond.
      Solution:
      Using Equation 1, we may solve for VIVU’s expected loss in percentage
      terms as follows:
       EL = POD × LGD, or 3.0% = [0.06 × 50%].
      We may calculate VIVU’s five-year credit spread by subtracting its 6.5%
      coupon from the 2.3% five-year US Treasury to solve for a G-spread of 4.2%.
      Based upon the approximation in Equation 2, we may conclude that VIVU
      investors are fairly compensated for assuming the credit risk since:
       Credit Spread > POD × LGD.
      Investors earn a 420 bps per year spread and have an expected loss of 300
      bps per year.

   3. How would the determination of the spread as well as investor’s view of the
      risk versus compensation for the VIVU bond change from Question 2 if we

                                   consider the VIVU bond’s actual maturity and call feature with the original
                                   6.5% coupon?
                                   Solution:
                                   VIVU investors face both call risk and greater maturity risk on the original
                                   bond terms versus a five-year, non-callable bond. As described in earlier
                                   lessons, bonds callable at a fixed price prior to maturity are advantageous to
                                   issuers and disadvantageous to investors, so investors expect to be compen-
                                   sated via a higher yield versus a similar non-callable bond given the uncer-
                                   tain maturity and limited price appreciation known as call risk. This op-
                                   tion-adjusted yield is the required market discount rate for which the bond’s
                                   price is adjusted for the value of the embedded option. Investors would also
                                   expect to be compensated for a longer time to maturity with a higher credit
                                   spread.

                              We may further consider the drivers of expected loss for BRWA’s unsecured
                           investment-grade debt as compared to VIVU’s secured high-yield debt in Example 2.
                           The POD is driven by an issuer’s ability to service debt based on both qualitative and
                           quantitative factors, including:
                               ■    Profitability: Stable, predictable cash flows and profits;
                               ■    Coverage: Sufficient cash flows/profits to make debt payments; and
                               ■    Leverage: Relative reliance on debt financing.
                               Higher profitability (as measured, for example, by EBIT margin) and higher cover-
                           age (EBIT to interest expense) coupled with lower leverage (debt to earnings or cash
                           flow ratios, such as debt/EBITDA or cash flow to net debt) are associated with lower
                           POD and higher credit quality. While financial ratios are one of several factors used
                           to assess credit risk, and their relative level by rating category varies widely across
                           industries and over time, Exhibit 5 provides a generic example of these relationships.

As Exhibit 5 shows, changes in profitability (EBIT margin), coverage (EBIT to inter-
est expense), and leverage (debt/EBITDA and cash flow to net debt) ratios over time
may result in ratings upgrades or downgrades as well as changing credit spreads. The
LGD for a given exposure, on the other hand, is largely a function of the nature and
seniority of a creditor’s claim in a default scenario, as shown in Exhibit 6:

                           investors expecting a greater likelihood of default seek to minimize EL by seeking
                           covenant restrictions and/or security to lower LGD.

                            QUESTION SET


                              1. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: The two com-
                                 ponents of credit risk are the _________________, typically measured over
                                 a 12-month horizon, and the _________________, which together with the
                                 recovery rate determine the _________________.
                                 Solution:
                                 The two components of credit risk are the probability of default, typically
                                 measured over a 12-month horizon, and the exposure at default (or ex-
                                 pected exposure), which together with the recovery rate determine the loss
                                 given default.

                              2. Which of the following statements best describes the difference between
                                 unsecured and secured debt obligations in the event of issuer default?
                                 A. Unsecured debtholders only have access to issuer cash flows, while
                                    secured debtholders only have access to specific pledged assets.
                                 B. Both unsecured and secured debtholders have access to unpledged
                                    assets, while only secured debtholders have access to specific pledged
                                    assets as a secondary repayment source.
                                  C. Only unsecured debtholders have access to pledged assets, while only
                                     secured debtholders have access to specific pledged assets.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. While all debtholders receive interest and principal payments
                                 from issuer cash flows, in an event of default both unsecured and secured

     debtholders have access to unpledged assets, while only secured debtholders
     have access to specific pledged assets as an additional repayment source.

  3. Which of the following factors are associated with a lower probability of
     default and higher credit quality for a corporate issuer?
      A. Higher profitability, higher coverage, and higher leverage
      B. Higher profitability, lower coverage, and lower leverage
      C. Higher profitability, higher coverage, and lower leverage
     Solution:
     C is correct. Higher profitability, higher coverage, and lower leverage are
     associated with a lower probability of default and higher credit quality for a
     corporate issuer.

  4. A bond investor analyzing Broadvue Corporation’s unsecured debt esti-
     mates a POD of 2% and an LGD of 80%. Using this information to approxi-
     mate the annual credit spread and observing an actual credit spread of 200
     bps per year, which of the following statements is correct?
      A. An investor would be fairly compensated for assuming Broadvue’s
         credit risk.
      B. An investor would be less than fairly compensated for assuming
         Broadvue’s credit risk.
      C. An investor would be more than fairly compensated for assuming
         Broadvue’s credit risk.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Since POD × LGD = 1.60% and the credit spread is 2.00%,
     Credit Spread > POD × LGD and the investor would expect to be more than
     fairly compensated for assuming Broadvue’s credit risk.




CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AND CREDIT RATINGS
                                                                                           3
              describe the uses of ratings from credit rating agencies and their
              limitations

The three major credit rating agencies—Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”),
Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”)—play a central role in the
credit markets. The rating agencies independently assess issuer credit risk on a
forward-looking basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis. For most outstanding
corporate and sovereign bonds, at least two of the agencies provide credit ratings, a
symbol-based measure of the potential risk of default of a particular bond or issuer
of debt.
    Many bond investors use credit ratings to provide direct and easy comparability of
the relative creditworthiness of all bond issuers, within and across industries and bond
types, although there is some debate about ratings comparability across the types of
bonds. Changes in credit ratings provide a broad overview of changing credit market
conditions. In individual bond or issuer cases, they may trigger covenants, changes to
debt pricing for step-up bonds, or other contractual clauses. Credit migration risk,
or downgrade risk, is the risk that a bond issuer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, or

                               migrates to a lower rating, leading investors to believe the risk of default is higher.
                               Credit ratings are also widely used to satisfy regulatory, statutory, and contractual
                               requirements.
                                   Ratings are issued on behalf of the issuer. To issue a rating, the rating agencies often
                               meet with the issuer and in some cases receive access to material non-public infor-
                               mation, such as financial projections unavailable to public investors. Rating agencies
                               monitor the ongoing performance of debt issuers once a rating is issued, adjusting
                               ratings higher as credit risk decreases or lower if a default is deemed more likely. In
                               addition, credit agencies may issue a positive or negative outlook as creditworthiness
                               improves or deteriorates but a rating change is not yet warranted.
                                   A rating agency’s forward-looking analysis may overlook or underestimate key
                               financial risks. For example, rating agencies were widely criticized for contributing to
                               the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–2009 given what came to be seen as overly opti-
                               mistic ratings on subprime mortgage-backed securities following the sharp decline
                               in housing prices. This led to regulatory attempts to reduce the dominant role of the
                               major credit rating agencies. As a result of these new rules, regulations, and legisla-
                               tion, credit rating agencies have become more transparent and reduced their conflicts
                               of interest. Additional credit rating agencies have emerged both globally and locally.
                               Some credit rating agencies are well-established in their home markets but are less
                               well-known globally, such as Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) in Canada and
                               Japan Credit Rating Agency (JCR) in Japan. The market dominance of the largest
                               credit rating agencies and the prevalence of the “issuer pay” model, however, remain
                               largely intact and unchallenged.


                               Credit Ratings
                               The three major global credit rating agencies use similar, symbol-based ratings that
                               assess a bond issue’s risk of default and the potential loss the investor may suffer.
                               Exhibit 7 compares their long-term rating scale ranked from highest to lowest. These
                               are ratings for bonds with a maturity exceeding one year. Ratings on short-term debt
                               follow a similar logic but are not shown here.

Aaa or AAA rated bonds are triple-A and are “of the highest quality, subject to the
lowest level of credit risk.” Bonds rated Baa3/BBB– or higher are called “investment
grade.” Bonds rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by S&P and Fitch,
respectively, are considered speculative credit and increasingly higher default risk. These
types of bonds are also referenced as: “low grade,” “speculative grade,” “non-investment
grade,” “below investment grade,” “high yield,” and more colloquially to specifically
emphasize their inherent riskiness, “junk bonds.” The D rating is reserved for securi-
ties that are already in default in S&P’s and Fitch’s scales. For Moody’s, bonds rated C
are likely, but not necessarily, in default. Issuers of bonds rated investment grade are
generally more consistently able to issue debt and can borrow at lower interest rates
than those rated below investment grade.
    In comparison to high-yield bonds, investment-grade bonds have a lower risk
profile, are less negatively affected by adverse economic and market conditions, and
are more appropriate for institutional portfolios that face quality restrictions.


Credit Rating Considerations
While credit rating agencies perform a useful market function by classifying bonds
based upon relative credit risk, market participants usually conduct their own analysis
rather than exclusively relying on ratings when choosing investments. Sole reliance
on credit ratings in making investment decisions includes pitfalls, such as the poten-
tial for rating agency decisions to lag market pricing of credit risk, overlook relevant
financial risks, or involve miscalculations or unforeseen changes not fully captured
in a rating agency’s forward-looking analysis. It is important for investors to perform
their own research and draw their own conclusions regarding the credit risk of a given
debt issue or issuer, particularly for investors in high-yield bonds or bonds that face
a potential downgrade.

                           Credit ratings tend to be sticky and lag market pricing of credit risk.

                               ■   Bond prices and credit spreads often move faster than rating agencies
                                   change their ratings (or ratings outlook) in response to changes in perceived
                                   creditworthiness. Credit spreads change daily, whereas bond ratings, appro-
                                   priately, change less frequently. Even over long time periods, however, credit
                                   ratings may lag changes in bond prices. Moreover, particularly for certain
                                   speculative-grade credits, two bonds with similar ratings may trade at very
                                   different credit spreads. This may result from the fact that credit ratings
                                   seek primarily to assess the expected loss, whereas for distressed debt, pric-
                                   ing is focused more on default timing and expected recovery rates.
                               ■   While ratings outlooks suggesting a possible future upgrade or downgrade
                                   are more closely aligned with market conditions, bond investors who wait
                                   for rating changes before making buy and sell decisions may underperform
                                   other investors who make portfolio decisions in advance of rating agency
                                   changes.


                           Some risks are difficult to capture in credit ratings.

                               ■   Examples include litigation risk, environmental risk, and natural disasters.
                                   Leveraged transactions, such as debt-financed acquisitions (i.e., changes
                                   in the capital structure through large stock buybacks), are often difficult
                                   to anticipate and thus to capture in credit ratings. Rating agencies may
                                   view complex risks very differently, resulting in divergent or split ratings
                                   between the agencies. For example, when WeWork Inc., a US-based real
                                   estate private start-up company with an asset light business model and neg-
                                   ative cash flow, issued unsecured debt for the first time in 2018, it was rated
                                   BB– by Fitch, B+ by S&P, and Caa1 by Moody’s.


                           Ratings may involve miscalculations or unforeseen changes not fully captured in
                           a rating agency’s forward-looking analysis.

                               ■   As mentioned earlier, credit rating agency analyses failed to anticipate
                                   the sharp decline in housing prices that led to the default of highly rated
                                   subprime mortgage bonds during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–2009.
                                   Historical examples of complex accounting fraud that supported high issuer
                                   credit ratings for companies that subsequently defaulted, include Enron and
                                   WorldCom in the United States and Wirecard AG in Germany.
                               Example 3 highlights these considerations using the example of Wirecard AG.

       Moody’s initiated its coverage of Wirecard AG by issuing a Baa3 long-term
  issuer rating in August 2019. The company’s debut public bond offering of
  EUR500 million in five-year senior unsecured debt with a fixed annual coupon
  of 0.5% was priced just below par in early September 2019.
       On 15 October 2019, Wirecard’s bond price fell below 85% of par following a
  Financial Times report alleging fraud and false accounting practices at the com-
  pany. While Wirecard denied the claims and subsequently hired an independent
  auditor, doubts remained among debt and equity investors. Despite changes at
  the company’s supervisory board and reports of a strategic investment from
  Japanese investment firm Softbank, the release of a critical independent audit in
  April 2020, delays in reporting audited financial results, and other irregularities
  contributed to ongoing investor concerns.
       With Wirecard AG’s bonds trading at a price near 80, Moody’s placed the
  company on review for downgrade on 2 June 2020, citing these concerns but
  retaining an IG issuer rating. Two weeks later, Wirecard AG bond prices plunged
  to 40 as claims of fraud and missing cash balances were confirmed in mid-June.
  On 19 June 2020, Moody’s downgraded the issuer to a sub-investment-grade
  B3 rating with a negative outlook and withdrew its credit rating altogether
  three days later, citing insufficient information to support the maintenance of
  a rating. The company filed for insolvency on 25 June 2020, and its bond price
  fell to below 20% of par value.

   Investors who bought and held Wirecard AG bonds until 19 June 2020 solely on
the basis of its IG credit rating suffered a substantial loss. The Wirecard example
highlights the challenges faced by credit rating agencies in evaluating expected loss
and adjusting credit ratings given a rapidly evolving series of events.

                              1. Which of the following choices properly ranks ratings from the
                                 three major credit rating agencies from the lowest to highest credit risk?
                                 A. B1, Ba2, Baa3
                                 B. BBB+, Ba3, B–

                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct.

                              2. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: In comparison to high-
                                 yield bonds, investment-grade bonds have a __________ risk profile and are
                                 __________ negatively affected by adverse economic and market conditions.
                                 Solution:
                                 In comparison to high-yield bonds, investment-grade bonds have a lower
                                 risk profile and are less negatively affected by adverse economic and market
                                 conditions.

                              3. Which of the following statements most accurately characterizes best prac-
                                 tices for the use of credit ratings among analysts?
                                 A. Analysts can generally rely on credit ratings and ratings outlooks to
                                    predict the market price of credit risk.
                                 B. Analysts must incorporate credit ratings into their analysis to meet
                                    regulatory requirements.
                                  C. Analysts should conduct their own credit analysis, as sole reliance on
                                     credit ratings to make investment decisions has several pitfalls.
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. A is incorrect since credit ratings tend to lag rather than pre-
                                 dict the market price of credit risk.

                              4. Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between
                                 credit ratings and market pricing of credit risk?
                                 A. Credit ratings primarily seek to assess expected loss, while market
                                    pricing of credit risk for investment-grade bonds is primarily focused
                                    on default timing and expected recovery rates.
                                 B. Credit rating outlooks tend to be more closely aligned with market
                                    conditions than credit ratings.
                                  C. Credit ratings usually capture the market pricing of credit risk associ-
                                     ated with debt-financed acquisitions.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. A is incorrect, as while credit ratings primarily seek
                                 to assess expected loss, the market pricing of credit risk for distressed bonds
                                 is primarily focused on default timing and expected recovery rates.

Factors Impacting Yield Spreads                                                                 361



FACTORS IMPACTING YIELD SPREADS
                                                                                            4
              describe macroeconomic, market, and issuer-specific factors that
              influence the level and volatility of yield spreads

Corporate bonds and other “credit-risky” debt instruments typically trade at a yield
premium, or spread, to bonds that have been considered “default-risk free,” such as
US Treasury bonds or German government bonds. Credit spreads, expressed in basis
points, widen based on issuer-specific factors, such as a decline in creditworthiness,
sometimes referred to as credit migration or downgrade risk, or market-based factors,
such as a greater risk aversion during periods of financial distress. Credit spread risk
is the risk of greater expected loss due to changes in credit conditions as a result of
macroeconomic, market, and/or issuer-related factors.


Macroeconomic Factors
Changing macroeconomic conditions and changes in the credit cycle often go in lock-
step: As the business cycle improves, credit spreads narrow and investors are willing
to assume more credit risk. A deteriorating credit cycle will cause credit spreads to
widen. Spreads are narrowest at or near the top of the credit cycle, when market par-
ticipants perceive credit risk to be at its lowest; they are widest at or near the bottom
of the credit cycle, when financial markets believe credit risk has reached its peak.
Beyond the higher coupons typically offered by high-yield bonds to compensate for
their greater risk, reasons for investing in HY bonds include the following:
   ■   Portfolio diversification – HY bonds often have lower correlation with IG
       bonds and default risk-free interest rates. Their inclusion in a fixed-income
       portfolio may therefore increase diversification and risk-adjusted return.
   ■   Capital appreciation – Economic recovery, or improved issuer-specific
       performance, often has a more sizeable positive impact on HY than IG bond
       prices. In addition to improved cash flow, other issuer-specific events that
       may drive capital appreciation include rating upgrades, mergers or acquisi-
       tions, or favorable management changes.
   ■   Equity-like return with lower volatility – While HY bond and equity prices
       tend to fluctuate in a similar way over the economic cycle, HY bond returns
       typically exhibit more stability given their larger income component versus
       stocks. Some empirical studies suggest that HY bonds offer a more attrac-
       tive risk–return profile than equities over the long term. They may also be
       preferable for yield-seeking investors with a limited ability to assume equity
       volatility.
    Credit ratings estimate expected loss by considering not only the POD but also
the LGD, establishing a clear relationship between credit ratings and bond yields. The
relationship between credit ratings and composite bond yields of different ratings and
maturities are shown in Exhibit 8.

                           Exhibit 8 shows three important relationships. First, the higher the credit rating,
                           the lower the yield for a given maturity. Investors require less compensation for the
                           risk of higher rated bonds with lower default risk. Second, in general, the longer the
                           maturity, the higher the yield, as default risk tends to rise for longer maturities. Third,
                           the yield spread difference between IG bond ratings is generally narrower than the
                           difference between IG and HY.
                               Over the cycle, HY bond spreads are more susceptible to widening under adverse
                           market conditions when investors tend to sell riskier assets and buy default risk-free
                           assets, known as a “flight to quality.” In addition, HY bonds may face liquidity risk,
                           which also widens bid–offer spreads in times of financial stress. The benefits and
                           considerations of adding HY bonds to a portfolio are addressed in Example 4.

  1. Describe the benefits and considerations of adding high-yield bonds to the
     investment portfolio under this scenario.
     Solution:
     Benefits: Investing in high-yield bonds should improve the risk-adjusted
     return of the overall portfolio in an expected environment of:

      ■   accelerating economic growth,
      ■   rising interest rates, and
      ■   falling HY default risk to a historical low.
     Considerations: The additional market risk arising from higher expected
     market volatility may temper the diversification benefit. In times of height-
     ened volatility, HY bonds may also be exposed to market liquidity risk when
     cash is needed from the portfolio (for example, to meet regular pension
     payments).

    Exhibit 9 presents a stylized view of these credit spread curve level and shape
changes for investment-grade (IG) and high-yield (HY) issuers over the economic
cycle moving clockwise across the four scenarios shown. The spread change in spread
for IG bonds is narrower than that for HY bonds. HY bonds are more sensitive to
changing macroeconomic and credit conditions.

                           There may be other systematic reasons why spreads change. Corporate bonds trade
                           primarily over the counter using broker–dealers who must commit their own capital
                           for market-making purposes. Tighter financial regulations increase the cost of holding
                           capital for trading in credit-risky bonds, particularly for large global banks that are
                           the most dominant market participants. Funding stresses also naturally translate into
                           wider credit spreads. The availability of funding is related to overall macroeconomic
                           and credit cycle conditions but may also be driven by market sentiment, such as the
                           willingness to take on risk. Additionally, in periods of heavy new issue supply, credit
                           spreads will widen if there is insufficient demand. In periods of high demand for
                           bonds, spreads will move tighter.


                           Market Factors
                           For the most liquid bonds with the lowest default risk, such as developed market
                           sovereign debt, the yield for a given maturity is a combination of real interest rates
                           plus an expected inflation rate premium. The yield spread on corporate bonds includes
                           an additional risk premium that compensates investors for credit and liquidity risks
                           as well as the potential tax impact of investing in a specific bond. Changes in any of
                           these components will alter the yield, price, and return on the bond. The total yield
                           spread over the government benchmark bond captures these risk components.
                               Market liquidity risk refers to the transaction costs associated with selling a bond.
                           This is the risk that the price at which investors can actually transact may differ from
                           the price indicated in the market through bid–ask spreads. The ability and willingness
                           of broker–dealers to make markets, as reflected in the bid–ask spread, is an important
                           determinant of market liquidity and associated risks to transact in the market.
                               Two main issuer-specific factors affect market liquidity risk. First, issuer size, or
                           more specifically the aggregate value of publicly traded debt an issuer has outstanding,
                           is an important liquidity factor. Second, the issuer’s credit quality is critical. In general,
                           the less debt an issuer has outstanding and the less frequently its debt trades, the

Factors Impacting Yield Spreads                                                              365


higher the market liquidity risk and the bid–ask spread. The lower the credit quality
of an issuer, the higher the market liquidity risk. To compensate investors for the risk
that there may not be sufficient market liquidity for them to buy or sell bonds in the
quantity they desire, the spread or yield premium on corporate bonds includes both
a market liquidity and a credit risk component.
    Typically, a bond that trades more frequently and with higher volume provides
investors more opportunity to purchase or sell the security and thus has less liquidity
risk. The difference between the bid (or purchase) and the offer (or sale) price depends
on the type of bond, the size of the transaction, and the time of execution, among other
factors. For instance, the most liquid government bonds often trade at a fraction of
a basis point between the purchase and sale prices, while less liquid corporate bonds
can have a much wider difference between the bid and offer prices.
    During times of financial stress or crisis, market liquidity can decline sharply,
causing bond prices to fall and yield spreads on corporate and other spread-based
debt to widen significantly. In most crises, not only does credit deterioration result in
wider bid–ask spreads, but it also may cause spillover effects from one fixed-income
market segment to others. For example, risk aversion among HY bond investors may
lead to significant spread widening among lower rated IG bonds as well.


Issuer-Specific Factors
Beyond macroeconomic and market factors, the expected financial performance of
individual issuers has a significant effect on both the level and volatility of yields and
yield spreads.
    In particular, factors common to all issuers include debt coverage and leverage.
Debt coverage refers to the sufficiency of a borrower’s resources or cash flows to make
necessary interest and principal payments, while leverage measures a borrower’s relative
reliance on debt versus other sources of financing. The source of repayment and use
of proceeds differ among issuer types. Corporate issuers typically invest in long-term
assets and repay debt from operating cash flow, while sovereign borrowers conduct
fiscal policy and provide public goods while collecting tax revenue as a primary source
of repayment. These factors are evaluated in detail for sovereign and non-sovereign
government as well as corporate issuers in later lessons.
    Investors often evaluate the yield and yield spread of a specific issuer’s bond using
a comparison to bonds within the same credit rating category, within the same sector
due to similar performance drivers, or to companies with a similar business model or
other common features. Example 5 illustrates the use of such a comparison to allow
an investor to distinguish between macroeconomic and issuer-specific factors.

   WeWork Yields versus B-Rated Corporates
   WeWork is a US-based real estate company that leases commercial properties
   to provide co-working spaces for firms and individuals. The company enjoyed
   a meteoric rise during its first several years of existence as a rapidly expanding
   office space lessee financed by private equity capital. Despite its asset light
   business model and negative cash flow, WeWork issued debt in April 2018, a
   privately placed USD700 million seven-year senior unsecured bond with a fixed
   coupon of 7.875% priced at par and rated Caa1 by Moody’s, B+ by S&P, and
   BB– by Fitch. The following diagram shows the relationship between the average
   five-year yield of corporate bonds with high credit risk with a similar maturity
   and WeWork’s bond yield following the issuance.

                                  We see that B-rated corporate bond yields fluctuated between 75% and 150%
                              of their April 2018 levels over the period, but WeWork’s bond yield exhibited
                              far greater volatility, reaching a yield nearly five times that of April 2018 in
                              early 2020. While a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this example, three
                              noteworthy issuer-specific events may be used to explain the relative yield
                              relationship over the period:
                                  WeWork’s Failed IPO (September 2019): The failure of WeWork’s widely antic-
                              ipated IPO was caused by weak governance and inflated growth and earnings
                              expectations, which resulted in a company valuation of USD50 billion. As the
                              failure increased WeWork’s relative reliance on existing debt versus anticipated
                              new equity, its bond yield nearly doubled, while average B-rated corporate bond
                              yields fell in a favorable macroeconomic environment through 2019.
                                  COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020): Economic shutdowns and work-from-
                              home policies had a disproportionately negative effect on WeWork’s co-working
                              business model and expected cash flows as compared to other HY issuers. The
                              company’s bonds traded at distressed prices as low as 35% of par value and were
                              downgraded to CCC+ (negative outlook) by S&P, the only credit rating agency
                              that had retained a B rating for WeWork to date.
                                  Recovery and WeWork’s IPO (October 2021): The decline in WeWork’s bond
                              yields was disproportionately large in 2021 as compared to B-rated corporate
                              yields as the economy reopened and employees returned to work. This improved
                              outlook allowed the company to revisit its plans to issue equity at a more real-
                              istic valuation. News of a possible second IPO attempt in mid-2021 caused
                              WeWork bond yields to decline. Its bonds traded at a premium when the IPO
                              was completed via a combination with special purpose acquisition company

  (SPAC) BowX, which valued WeWork at USD9 billion and raised USD1.3 billion
  in cash. WeWork’s reduced reliance on debt and improved cash flow caused its
  bond yields to trade close to those of B-rated bonds, despite its lower rating.

    This simplified WeWork example ignores duration differences and compares bonds
across sectors within a ratings category rather than within the commercial real estate
sector or among comparable asset light, negative cash companies, such as Uber. Later
fixed-income lessons will introduce greater detail in comparing issuer-specific, mac-
roeconomic, and market factors.


The Price Impact of Spread Changes
In an earlier module, we explained how bond duration and convexity are used to
approximate a bond’s price change given a change in yield-to-maturity. We now address
the source of the yield-to-maturity change. Since the yield-to-maturity on a corporate
bond consists of a government benchmark yield and a spread, a change in the bond’s
yield-to-maturity can originate in either component or a combination of the two. The
key point is that for an option-free fixed-rate bond, the same duration and convexity
statistics that apply for a change in benchmark yield also apply for a change in spread.
     Importantly, the modified duration and convexity measures give an approximate
change in the full price of a bond for a change in yield-to-maturity, regardless of the
source of the change. However, changes in the yield-to-maturity components do not
occur in isolation. In practice, the analyst is concerned with the interaction between
benchmark yield and spread changes, between changes in expected inflation and the
expected real rate, and between changes in credit and liquidity risk. For example, a
“flight to quality” described earlier can cause government benchmark yields to fall
as credit spreads widen and liquidity declines for bonds of low credit-quality issuers.
     Example 6 shows the risk/return components of a bond via a hypothetical spread
decomposition.

  Decomposition of a Romanian Eurobond Yield
  In 2019, the Government of Romania issued its first-ever 4.625% 30-year
  Eurobond, which was priced at a spread of 411.4 bps over the 1.25% Federal
  Republic of Germany bond maturing 15 August 2048. The initial yield spread
  indicated the combined credit and liquidity risk of the bond. The 4.625% Romania
  bond subsequently traded in a wide price range, reflecting the prevailing market
  assessment of its credit risk and yield spread as well as the benchmark German
  yield, as shown in the chart below:

                                  Suppose that two years after issuance, the bond was traded at 122.25/125.75
                              (bid/offer). This meant that a buyer would have to pay the offer price of 125.75
                              for the bond and a seller would receive the bid price of 122.25.
                                  Bond mid-market price = (122.25 + 125.75)/2 = 124.00.
                                  With 28 years remaining to maturity, the Romanian bond yield based on its

                              shown as:
                                  = 3.2988% − 0.2350%
                                  = 3.0638% or 306.38 bps.
                                  To further break down this spread, we can compute the liquidity spread
                              using the bid/offer prices. At the offer price, the yield is equivalent to 3.2396%:
                                                   28 _  4.625      _  100
                                  	​125.25 = ∑
                                             ​        ​​       n ​+ ​         ​
                                                   n=1 ​(1 + r)​ ​ ​(1 + r)​28​

                                  r	​ ≈ 3.2396%​.
                                  At the bid price, the yield is equivalent to 3.3588%:
                                                   28 _  4.625      _  100
                                  	​122.75 = ∑
                                             ​        ​​       n ​+ ​         ​
                                                   n=1 ​(1 + r)​ ​ ​(1 + r)​28​

                                  r	​ ≈ 3.3588%​.
                                  Therefore: Liquidity spread = 3.3588% − 3.2396% = 0.1192% or 11.92 bps.
                                  Credit spread = 306.38 bps − 11.92 bps = 294.46 bps.

    While IG debt investors are less likely to be impacted by default, they are more
focused on spread risk—that is, the effect on prices and returns from changes in
spreads. The price impact from spread changes is driven by two main factors: (1) the
modified duration of the bond and (2) the magnitude of the spread change. The effect
on return to the bondholder depends on the holding period used to calculate the return.
    In the case of a small, instantaneous change in yield spread, the price impact can
be approximated, as shown in Equation 3, by
   %∆PVFull = −AnnModDur × ∆Spread,                                                         (3)
   where AnnModDur is the annualized modified duration and PVFull is the bond’s
full price. Note that lower (higher) spreads have a positive (negative) impact on bond
prices and thus returns.
    For larger spread changes, the effect of convexity needs to be incorporated into
the approximation, as seen in Equation 4:
   %∆PVFull = −(AnnModDur × ∆Spread) + ½AnnConvexity × (∆Spread)2,                          (4)
    where AnnConvexity is annualized convexity. Care is required to ensure convex-
ity is properly scaled to be consistent with how the spread change is expressed. For
option-free bonds, convexity should be scaled so it has the same order of magnitude
as duration squared and the spread change is expressed as a decimal. For example, if a
bond has duration of 5.0 and reported convexity of 0.235, then first re-scale convexity
to 23.5, and then apply the formula. For a 1% increase in spread, the result would be
   %∆PVFull = (−5.0 × 0.01) + ½ × 23.5 × (0.01)2 = −0.048825 or −4.8825%.
The price impact of instantaneous spread changes is illustrated in Exhibit 10 using
the two semiannual coupon BRWA bonds with a price of par highlighted in the pre-
ceding lessons:

From the initial spread, in increments of 50 bps and for both wider and narrower
spreads, the new price and actual return for each spread change are calculated.
Moreover, the estimated returns without and then with the convexity term are pre-
sented. As shown, the approximation using only duration is reasonably accurate for
small spread changes, but for larger changes, the convexity term generally provides
a meaningful improvement, as in Exhibit 11.

                           Note the price change for a given spread change is higher for the longer-duration bond
                           than for the shorter-duration bond. As with yield changes, longer-duration corporate
                           bonds have “higher spread sensitivity,” meaning their prices, and returns, are more
                           volatile with respect to spread changes.
                               Additionally, investors must be compensated for greater uncertainty about an
                           issuer’s future creditworthiness in longer-dated bonds. An investor might be confi-
                           dent in assessing issuer default risk in the near term; however, investor uncertainty
                           grows over time due to factors that are increasingly difficult to forecast (e.g., poor
                           management strategy or execution, technological obsolescence, natural or man-made
                           disasters, corporate leveraging events).
                               Example 7 shows the impact on price of a bond due to changes in credit quality
                           or liquidity. Here we apply the methodology from an earlier lesson to approximate
                           modified duration and convexity. We estimated the modified duration by increasing and
                           decreasing the yield-to-maturity by the same amount (ΔYield) to calculate correspond-
                           ing bond prices PV+ and PV_ for a given initial price (PV0), as shown in Equation 5:

EXAMPLE 7

  Bond Price Sensitivity to Spread Changes
  Show the price impact on the 4.625% 30-year Romania Eurobond versus a new
  shorter-term Romania bond (details below) if the spread changes due to changes
  in credit quality and/or liquidity. Show estimated price and return changes (using
  modified duration and convexity), approximate modified duration and convexity
  versus actual price changes and returns (using the Excel PRICE function), and
  discuss the results.
      On 13 July 2021, Romania issued another EUR2 billion 1.75% Eurobond:
      ■     Coupon: 1.75% (annual)
      ■     Priced at 99.95% of par
      ■     Yield: 1.756%
      ■     Maturity date: 13 July 2030
      ■     Settlement date: 13 July 2021
      ■     Benchmark 10-year German bund yield: –0.292%
     (Note: ApproxModDur: 8.2600; ApproxCon: 79.2963.)
     The modified duration and convexity of this bond are computed using the

                                             There are two main observations from the tables above:

                                             a. The estimated price changes and returns using modified duration and
                                                convexity are quite close to actual price changes and returns, espe-
                                                cially for the shorter-duration 2030 bond. The longer a bond’s dura-
                                                tion, the greater the discrepancy between estimated and actual price
                                                changes.
                                             b. The 2049 bond is far more sensitive to spread changes than the 2030
                                                bond. The longer the duration, the more sensitive a bond’s price is to
                                                changes in credit quality and bond liquidity.

                                                                                        Spread Change (bps)

                                                                                          2030s         2049s


                               Taking on more default risk in fixed income offers higher potential return but at
                           the cost of higher volatility and less certainty of earning that return. The lower the
                           credit quality, the higher the quoted yield. The realized yield, or return, will almost
                           always differ because of changes in interest rates, coupon re-investment rates, hold-
                           ing period changes, and the credit-related risks discussed earlier. Additionally, the
                           volatility of returns will vary by rating. Example 8 shows the impact on bond prices
                           due to a credit downgrade.

                              The 3.2% BRWA senior unsecured five-year note was originally offered with

  on the legacy technology of internal combustion engines. Based on the current
  market environment, the differences in credit spread in the same industry due

  observed to be 1.0% and 2.2%, respectively.

      Using Equation 3, the price impact on the 3.20% BRWA 2030 bond can be
  estimated as:
      %∆PVFull = −(AnnModDur × ∆Spread) + ½AnnConvexity × (∆Spread)2

      = −(3.82250 × 0.01) + ½(20.2264) × (0.01)2

      = −0.037214 or −3.7214%.
      For the 6.20% BRWA 2035 bond, the price impact is estimated as:
      %∆PVFull = −(6.57882×0.022) + ½(58.43082) × (0.0220)2

      = −0.130594 or −13.0594%.
     As in the earlier examples, the negative price impact on the longer-duration
  bond is expected to be much larger due to credit migration.


QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following statements best describes the relative per-
     formance of HY bonds over the economic cycle?
      A. HY bonds often have lower correlation with IG bonds and default risk-
         free interest rates.
      B. HY bond and equity prices tend to fluctuate similarly over the eco-
         nomic cycle, but HY bond returns exhibit more stability given their
         smaller income component versus stocks.
      C. Economic recovery or improved issuer-specific performance often has
         a similar positive impact on HY and IG bond prices.
     Solution:
     A is correct. B is incorrect since HY exhibit more stability due to a higher
     income component versus stocks. C is incorrect since economic recovery or
     improved issuer-specific performance usually has a greater positive impact
     on HY versus IG bond prices.

                                 est to 7.5%?
                                 A. 1% decrease
                                 B. 1% increase
                                  C. 2% increase
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C, as shown by solving for ∆Spread in Equation 4:
                                 %∆PVFull = −(AnnModDur × ∆Spread) + ½AnnConvexity × (∆Spread)2

                                 − (4 × 0.02) + ½(25) × (0.02)2 = –0.075 or –7.5%.
                                 The spread change is inversely related to the price effect, with a spread in-
                                 crease leading to a fall in bond price. Note that since duration was 4, we had
                                 to rescale the convexity from 0.25 to 25.

      since Bond 1’s higher spread is sufficient compensation for the higher POD
      versus Bond 2.

   B. An investor should prefer Bond 2 over Bond 1, since they may earn a spread
      that is more than sufficient for assuming the credit risk.

   C. An investor should prefer Bond 1 over Bond 2, since it offers the highest
      spread relative to the expected loss.

5. Pitfalls of relying solely on credit ratings when making bond investment decisions
   may be best described as the following:
   A. Rating agencies may change their rating in response to changing market and
      credit conditions for a given issuer.

   B. Credit agencies may issue a positive or negative outlook for an issuer as
      credit risk rises or falls, but a rating change is not yet warranted.

   C. Ratings may involve miscalculations or unforeseen changes not fully cap-
      tured in a rating agency’s forward-looking analysis.

                           6. An investment-grade bond with modified duration of 7 and reported convexity
                              of 0.51 increases in price by 9.93% after a yield spread change. The value of the

   SOLUTIONS
1. Credit migration risk (or downgrade risk) is the risk that a bond issuer’s cred-
   itworthiness deteriorates, leading investors to believe the risk of default is higher
   and causing the yield spreads on the issuer’s bonds to widen and the price of its
   bonds to fall.

2. The correct answer is C.
   Here we may use Equation 1 to solve for POD:
   EL = POD × (EE – Collateral) × (1 – RR).
   Substituting in the values provided:
   USD2,500 = POD × (USD150,000)×(1 – 0.95)

   POD = USD2,500/(USD150,000 ×0.05) = 0.33 = 33%.

3. While the likelihood of default for IG borrowers is typically below that of an HY
   issuer, an investor’s loss in the event of a default for secured debt is usually lower
   than unsecured debt due to the secondary source of repayment.

4. C is correct. We can compare Bond 1 and Bond 2 by calculating the expected loss
   for each and comparing it to the annual spread:
   EL = POD × LGD

   Credit Spread ≈ POD × LGD

   Bond 1: EL = 0.938% (= 1.25% × 75%)

   Spread − EL = 6.2 bps (= 1.00% − 0.938%).

   Bond 2: EL = 0.935% (= 1.1% × 85%)

   Spread − EL = 1.5 bps (=0.95% − 0.935%).
   An investor should therefore choose Bond 1 given its higher expected return
   versus credit risk. A is incorrect as it fails to take the LGD into account. B is
   incorrect as although Bond 1 earns a 1.5 bps spread above the expected annual
   loss, it is less than the additional 6.2 bps spread above the expected loss earned by
   purchasing Bond 1.

5. The correct answer is C. While answers A and B are both true, they are not a
   pitfall of sole reliance on credit ratings when making bond investments.

6. The correct answer is A. Equation 4 estimates bond price changes based on dura-
   tion, convexity, and changes in spread:
   %∆PVFull = −(AnnModDur × ∆Spread) + ½AnnConvexity × (∆Spread)2.
   With ModDur = 7 and reported convexity 0.51, making the necessary convexity
   re-scaling and substituting in values to solve for spread results in
   0.0993 = −(7 x ∆Spread) + ½ (51) (∆Spread)2

   ∆Spread =-0.015 = -1.5%.
   Lower spreads make the first expression in the equation positive, along with the
   equation’s second convexity-based term. The answer must therefore involve a

Credit Analysis for Government Issuers
 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              explain special considerations when evaluating the credit of
              sovereign and non-sovereign government debt issuers and issues




INTRODUCTION
This learning module explores special considerations for the credit evaluation of
                                                                                            1
sovereign and other public issuers that often access fixed-income markets to finance
their activities.
    A major difference between corporate and sovereign issuers is the use of proceeds
and source of repayment of debt obligations. In contrast to corporations that fund
working capital and fixed assets to generate profits, sovereign and other government
issuers use debt to conduct fiscal policy, supply public goods and services, and fund
other government expenditures. While companies primarily rely on operating cash
flow to repay debt, governments use tax revenues and other government revenues,
such as tariffs and fees, to pay interest and principal.
    We analyze sovereign bonds using a combination of qualitative and quantitative fac-
tors to assess their ability and willingness to pay. Sovereign defaults are not uncommon,
particularly as countries transition from emerging to advanced economies. However,
in contrast to corporate issuers, sovereign bondholders are generally unable to force
governments to declare bankruptcy and liquidate assets. Non-sovereign issuers, such
as certain local governments or quasi-government entities, also issue debt to finance
their expenditures or develop infrastructure. This debt is backed by their ability to
levy local taxes or generate specific project revenue.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Governments borrow in public markets to conduct fiscal pol-
           icy and meet budgetary needs, such as the provision of public
           goods.
       ■   A sovereign government’s ability to tax private economic activity
           causes these bonds to normally have the lowest credit risk of any
           issuer in a specific country. In advanced economies, sovereign debt is
           often considered default risk-free.

                                  ■   A combination of qualitative and quantitative factors is used to ana-
                                      lyze a sovereign issuer’s ability and willingness to pay.
                                  ■   Greater central bank independence from the sovereign issuing entity
                                      reduces the likelihood that a national government will simply increase
                                      the money supply by purchasing domestic debt.
                                  ■   A key distinction for sovereign creditworthiness is whether its domes-
                                      tic currency is considered to be a reserve currency, that is, one that is
                                      fully convertible and held by foreign central banks and other investors.
                                  ■   Non-sovereign government debt is issued by local governments or
                                      quasi-government entities, backed by their tax revenue or specific
                                      project revenue.
                                  ■   The credit analysis of non-sovereign debt backed by tax revenue has
                                      similar considerations to sovereign bonds, while project-based revenue
                                      bonds are typically evaluated based upon the cash flows associated
                                      with the underlying project.



                            LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                              These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                              of understanding of this learning module.

                              1. Identify the debt type that corresponds to the correct example:

                                 A) sovereign debt, B) non-sovereign debt, C) corporate debt
                                                                       ​




                               1. Issued by an entity backed by cash
                               flow from its business operations
                               2. Issued by a country’s government,
                               backed by its ability and willingness
                               to tax
                               3. Issued by a local government
                               or entity, backed by its ability and
                               willingness to tax, or revenue from a
                               specific public project
                                                                       ​




                                 Solution:
                                 1. C is correct. Corporate debt is issued by non-government corporations
                                 to finance business operations, and payments are made from operating cash
                                 flow.
                                 2. A is correct. Sovereign debt is issued by national governments to conduct
                                 fiscal policy and finance their budgets. This debt is paid based on the gov-
                                 ernment’s ability and willingness to collect taxes from within a jurisdiction.
                                 3. B is correct. Non-sovereign debt is issued by sub-sovereign or local gov-
                                 ernments and related entities. These bonds are supported by the local taxing
                                 authority of the issuer or specific public project revenue.

                              2. The principle of sovereign immunity is related to the sovereign
                                 government’s:
                                  A. ability to pay.
                                  B. ability to tax.

Introduction                                                                             381


      C. willingness to pay.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Under the principle of sovereign immunity, national laws
     limit investors’ ability to force a sovereign government into bankruptcy or
     liquidate its assets to settle debt claims as would be the case for a corporate
     issuer.

  3. The creditworthiness of sovereign and other government borrowers is based
     upon qualitative and quantitative factors. Which of the following is not a
     quantitative factor?
      A. External stability
      B. Economic growth and flexibility
      C. Fiscal strength
     Solution:
     B is correct. The quantitative factor is actually economic growth and stabili-
     ty, not flexibility.

  4. Which of the following statements best describes characteristics of external
     strength associated with higher credit quality?
      A. A government that is able to impose and enforce capital controls
      B. A government that has established free trade agreements with neigh-
         boring countries
      C. A government whose central bank issues a reserve currency
     Solution:
     C is correct. A key distinction for sovereign creditworthiness is whether
     its domestic currency is considered to be a reserve currency, fully convert-
     ible and frequently held by foreign central banks and other investors. A is
     incorrect as capital controls may not support debt capacity. B is incorrect
     since free trade is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for establishing
     external strength.

  5. Match the following debt issuances to the correct issuer type:

     A) agency bonds, B) general obligation bonds, C) revenue bonds
                                              ​




    1. Bonds issued for building a regional
    highway toll road
    2. Bonds issued by the national
    mortgage finance corporation, under
    national law.
    3. Bonds issued by a state government
    to fund a pension deficit
                                              ​




     Solution:
     1. C is correct. Revenue bonds are issued to finance a specific public benefit
     project, mostly supported by the local/regional government. The revenue
     from the project supported by the economic base for utilization of the proj-
     ect determines its credit worthiness.
     2. A is correct. Agencies are quasi-government entities whose primary activ-
     ities are to fulfill a government-sponsored mission to provide public services
     that are often based upon a specific sovereign law or statute. In many cases,

                                 either the law or statute creating the entity authorizes it to finance its activi-
                                 ties using debt.
                                 3. B is correct. General obligation (GO) bonds are unsecured bonds backed
                                 by the general revenues of the issuing non-sovereign government. These
                                 bonds are supported by the taxing authority of the issuer, rather than the
                                 revenue from a specific project.

                              6. Which of the following is a relevant qualitative factor for assessing the sov-
                                 ereign rating for a country’s debt issue?
                                  A. Natural resources
                                  B. Trading partnership with a strong economy
                                  C. Economic diversification
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. One of the key factors for assessing the creditworthiness of a
                                 sovereign issuer’s debt is the degree of economic diversification, as well as
                                 growth potential. The economies in countries with the highest-rated sover-
                                 eign borrowers typically have an advanced and highly diversified domestic
                                 economy with strong, sustainable growth prospects. Emerging or frontier
                                 market economies, on the other hand, often depend upon a single industry
                                 or commodity and/or fewer trading partners, causing the tax revenues avail-
                                 able to these sovereign borrowers to be more susceptible to an economic
                                 downturn, key commodity price fluctuations, and/or trade interruptions.




              2            SOVEREIGN CREDIT ANALYSIS

                                         explain special considerations when evaluating the credit of
                                         sovereign and non-sovereign government debt issuers and issues

                           As outlined in earlier lessons, both sovereign and non-sovereign governments issue
                           debt to finance their activities. In contrast to corporate debt, this debt is used to
                           conduct fiscal policy and meet budgetary needs, such as providing public goods and
                           services including infrastructure, health care, and education. The primary source of
                           repayment for sovereign debt is usually taxes and other government revenue, which
                           can include fees, tariffs, and in some cases the profits of state-owned enterprises. A
                           sovereign government’s ability to tax all private economic activity under its jurisdiction
                           is the primary reason why such bonds usually have the lowest credit risk of any issuer
                           within a specific country. While sovereign bonds in the most advanced economies
                           are often considered default risk-free, those issued by emerging and frontier market
                           governments involve greater default risk.
                                Bond investors evaluate the creditworthiness of both corporate and public issuers
                           by the stability and predictability of issuer cash flows, the sufficiency of those cash
                           flows to meet required interest and principal payments, and the issuer’s relative reliance
                           on debt financing versus other available resources. The creditworthiness of sovereign
                           and other government borrowers is based upon qualitative and quantitative factors
                           unique to the public sector, as shown in the following sections.

Qualitative Factors
Sovereign government policies affecting the macroeconomy and financial markets
include monetary and fiscal policies that typically seek to create an economic envi-
ronment with positive, stable growth and stable, low inflation. Domestic and foreign
investors evaluate the creditworthiness of a sovereign issuer by considering a gov-
ernment’s taxation and spending policies and the underlying economy as a primary
source of tax revenue for repayment. Qualitative factors included in this assessment
are shown in Exhibit 1.

ernment institutions and policies in fostering political and economic stability. From
an economic standpoint, these policies range from basic legal protections, such as
maintaining the rule of law and the enforcement of property rights, to promoting a
culture of debt repayment, transparency, the consistency of financial data reporting,
and the relative ease of doing business within a jurisdiction. Political factors include
stability of domestic political institutions and the absence of conflict with neighboring
countries. These factors are often captured using a relative ranking or scoring approach.
    In addition to a sovereign government’s ability to pay, we must also consider its
willingness to pay. Willingness to pay is important for sovereign issuers because of the
principle of sovereign immunity, under which investors face limitations in forcing
a sovereign government to declare bankruptcy or liquidate its assets to settle debt
claims as would be the case for a corporate issuer. Sovereign immunity limits the legal
recourse of bondholders in many instances, preventing external creditors from fully
enforcing debt claims. In most cases, given the involvement of multiple lenders and
multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investors agree
to restructure debt to provide extended terms and/or favorable interest rates for a
specified period to recover their investment, as in the following example.

EXAMPLE 1

   Uruguay’s 2003 Sovereign Debt Exchange
   After years of economic stagnation compounded by a banking crisis resulting
   from large deposit withdrawals first by neighboring Argentines and then by its
   own residents, Uruguay was forced to float its currency in June 2002. This caused
   a large depreciation of the Uruguayan peso (UYI) which, together with the fiscal
   cost of the banking crisis, led to a sharp rise in debt that pushed the country to
   the brink of default. With the support of the IMF, in March 2003 the authorities
   announced their intention to carry out a market-friendly debt restructuring to

                              moderate short-term liquidity pressures and improve the medium-term servic-
                              ing profile of foreign currency-denominated sovereign debt. A debt exchange
                              to extend Uruguay’s bond maturities by five years was successfully agreed to in
                              May 2003 with the consent of 90% of bondholders. Although the transaction
                              was voluntary, it was deemed by analysts to be a default in substance given a
                              lack of sufficient bondholder compensation for the delayed debt payment as well
                              as the subordination of bondholders who did not participate in the exchange.

                               Fiscal Flexibility: Sovereign governments are also evaluated on how well they estab-
                           lish and maintain fiscal discipline over time and under different economic conditions.
                           The management of public finances extends from the enforceability of tax collection
                           to the prudent allocation of government budget expenditures on public goods to
                           managing sovereign debt outstanding relative to economic activity. This assessment
                           is based upon past experience in adjusting spending over economic cycles and the
                           expected effect of fiscal policy changes, as in the following example.

                            EXAMPLE 2

                              Government of Romania’s Improved Ratings Outlook
                              In October 2021, Moody’s Investors Service changed its ratings outlook on the
                              Government of Romania from negative to stable with a Baa3 issuer and senior
                              unsecured debt rating. In addition to solid economic growth prospects, Moody’s
                              cited an expectation of consistent and sustained fiscal consolidation as a reason
                              for the improved outlook. As part of Romania’s goal to become a full-fledged
                              member state after joining the EU in 2007, the government was expected to
                              prepare and implement fiscal reforms to reduce its annual deficit to below 3%
                              of GDP within three years. The incentive to reduce the deficit was strengthened
                              by the possible suspension of EU structural and investment grants in the case
                              of non-compliance.

                               Monetary Effectiveness: Monetary policy involves central bank activity directed
                           toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. Central banks
                           establish short-term interest rates and reserve requirements, and they buy and sell
                           sovereign bonds using open market operations—all to encourage stable and sustainable
                           growth amid relative price stability. At one extreme, central banks may implement
                           policy almost completely independent of government interference and influence;
                           at the other extreme, they may simply act as the agent of the government. Central
                           bank independence from the public Treasury reduces the likelihood that a sovereign
                           government will monetize their domestic debt, driving domestic inflation higher and
                           reducing the external value of the domestic currency.
                               Economic Flexibility: The economic activity under a sovereign government’s
                           jurisdiction available to tax and service debt is usually the primary source of debt
                           repayment. Key factors important in gauging creditworthiness include not only the
                           size of an economy and level of per capital income, but also the degree of economic
                           diversification and growth potential.
                               Economies in countries with the highest-rated sovereign borrowers typically
                           have an advanced and highly diversified domestic economy with strong, sustainable
                           growth prospects. Emerging or frontier market economies, on the other hand, often
                           depend upon a single industry or commodity or have fewer trading partners, causing
                           the tax revenues available to these sovereign borrowers to be more susceptible to an
                           economic downturn, key commodity price fluctuations, and/or trade interruptions.
                           In many cases, such countries have a sizable informal economy or face challenges in
                           collecting tax revenue.

Sovereign Credit Analysis                                                                    385


    External Status: External status or governance refers to how a sovereign gov-
ernment’s international trade, capital, and foreign exchange policies influence its
ability to support and service outstanding debt. Monetary policy credibility and the
exchange rate regime have a significant effect on international capital flows. A key
distinction for the creditworthiness of a sovereign government is whether its domestic
currency is considered to be a reserve currency, that is, one that is fully convertible
and frequently held by foreign central banks and other investors as a portion of their
foreign exchange reserves. When foreign investors are able and willing to hold assets
in a country’s currency in the form of cash, sovereign bonds, and other investments,
it greatly expands the government’s ability to access foreign investors using domestic
currency debt. This greater flexibility minimizes the likelihood of sovereign default
and increases a government’s ability to sustain structural budget deficits and a higher
level of debt.
    In contrast, many emerging and frontier market countries have exchange rate
restrictions, capital controls, and/or a lack of full convertibility that constrains their
ability to borrow from foreign entities by issuing bonds in foreign currencies. In cases
where such debt markets are unavailable, these countries are more likely to access
foreign currency funding from supranational organizations, such as the IMF, in order
to meet development needs or implement economic reforms.
    While a country’s internal and external strength are usually determined by its
economic growth dynamics, competitiveness, and diversification, geopolitical risk is
also often a factor to consider, as in the following example.

EXAMPLE 3

   Moldova’s IMF Credit Facility
   Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused a deterioration
   in the creditworthiness of several East European countries due to heightened
   political and economic risk. Given its proximity to the conflict and the influx
   of far more refugees on a per capita basis than its neighbors, the Republic of
   Moldova faced the greatest adverse economic impact. Rising inflation, stagnant
   growth, and a higher current account deficit due to falling exports and rising
   energy prices led Moldovan authorities to request and receive permission from
   the IMF to partially draw down an extended credit facility to meet immediate
   external obligations, such as energy purchases, in May 2022. The Moldovan gov-
   ernment received IMF approval for the temporary funding by both submitting
   a budget to meet immediate fiscal needs due to the crisis and reinforcing its
   commitment to pursue structural economic reforms in order to avert a default.

icy), economic, and external factors used to evaluate sovereign creditworthiness are

                           In practice, many of these qualitative factors are interrelated; for example, a weak legal
                           system often goes hand in hand with a limited ability to collect taxes due or enforce
                           debt contracts. The use of these qualitative factors in assessing creditworthiness is
                           best understood using an example, such as the following country comparison.

                            EXAMPLE 4

                              Moldova and Romania
                              Three decades after emerging from central planning to a market economy,
                              Romania and Moldova share linguistic, cultural, and historical ties as well as a
                              common border, but they have different sovereign credit risk profiles. Romania
                              is an investment-grade sovereign issuer (rated Baa3 by Moody’s, and BBB– by
                              S&P and Fitch), while Moldova is a non-investment-grade issuer (rated B3 by
                              Moody’s, and B– by S&P and Fitch) based in part upon the following factors:

                                  Government Institutions & Policy: While both Romania and Moldova
                                  established representative democracies following one-party rule under
                                  socialism, Romania signed an Association Agreement with the EU in
                                  1992 and formally joined in 2007, codifying its access to European mar-
                                  kets and economic integration. Moldova’s political transition was slower,
                                  and its government is still considered by many analysts to be an unstable
                                  democracy, with weak governance and institutions and widespread cor-
                                  ruption. Moldova faces economic and political hurdles in joining the EU,
                                  including an unresolved conflict within the Transnistria region as well as
                                  internal resistance to EU membership. It did not formally apply to join
                                  the EU until 2022.

                                  Given its aspiration to join the euro currency area, Romania’s fiscal and
                                  monetary policy is focused on meeting strict EU convergence crite-
                                  ria, including limiting fiscal deficits and government debt outstanding,

                                  est rates. Romania has a financial and banking system with an active,
                                  but small, domestic currency government and corporate bond market.
                                  Moldova’s financial system is less well developed, and it faces near-term
                                  fiscal and monetary challenges compounded by the Ukraine conflict as

Sovereign Credit Analysis                                                                  387


       is concentrated in short-term maturities, and its ability to borrow is
       limited, while domestic inflation is well above the central bank’s target
       despite its monetary tightening measures.
       Economy: Romania has a much larger, more diversified, and competitive
       industrial economy due to the influx of foreign direct investment from
       EU countries since its transition to a market economy as well as abundant
       natural resources. Moldova in contrast was slower to privatize its econ-
       omy following socialism, facing a limited ability to attract capital over the
       transition period with a high degree of dependence on Russia for energy
       imports. The domestic economy remains dependent upon agriculture and
       food processing (which comprise 40% of GDP).

       External Status: While both countries increased access to foreign cur-
       rency bond markets after emerging from socialism, Moldova rescheduled
       its foreign currency debt in 2002 to avoid default and remains depen-
       dent upon IMF credit facilities as outlined earlier. In contrast, Romania
       has maintained access to international capital markets, issuing foreign
       currency (EUR and USD) bonds both before and after the 2022 invasion
       of Ukraine. As Moldova is more dependent on regional trading partners,
       has less well diversified exports and fewer trading partners, it has faced
       greater trade disruption due to the war in Ukraine.



Quantitative Factors
Quantitative credit analysis seeks to estimate the likelihood that an issuer can meet
its fixed debt obligations. Unlike corporations that issue periodic financial statements
based upon generally accepted accounting principles, sovereign credit analysts must
rely on government economic data, which varies in terms of quality and timing, lacks
comparability across countries and over time, and faces periodic revision as well as
political considerations. As a result, detailed public sector financial balance sheets
tend to be of limited use in forecasting creditworthiness, with analysts focusing on a
top-down, macroeconomic approach based upon the quantitative factors shown in
Exhibit 3.

                           Financial ratios allow the comparison across sovereign issuers and over time in a
                           similar way as for corporate issuers. While the relevant numerator for such ratios is
                           often debt size or the level of periodic fixed payments as for corporate issuers, the
                           denominator is not total sales or total assets but often either government revenue
                           or domestic GDP as the primary measure of economic activity subject to taxation.
                               Fiscal Strength: Measuring a sovereign issuer’s relative fiscal strength depends upon
                           both its current and expected future debt burden, as well as the relative reliance on

                           Debt burden measures are similar to leverage and provide an indication of a govern-
                           ment’s solvency. In each case, a higher debt burden ratio is associated with lower credit
                           quality. In addition, annual fiscal surpluses or deficits as a percentage of GDP are often
                           used to measure fiscal discipline and to determine whether a country’s debt burden is
                           improving or deteriorating over time. Debt affordability, on the other hand, provides
                           a measure of debt coverage, with a higher ratio also a sign of lower credit quality.

                              Fiscal Deficits and Debt-to-GDP in the Eurozone Crisis
                              The European debt crisis of 2010 arose as several European Union member states
                              (including Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were no longer able
                              to meet their financial obligations without the assistance of other EU member
                              states, the European Central Bank, and/or the International Monetary Fund. The
                              situation stemmed largely from the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of
                              2008–09, as governments provided financial assistance to failing domestic banks
                              while their domestic economies stalled and tax revenue fell. As members of the
                              euro currency zone under the direction of the European Central Bank, these
                              countries were prevented from using monetary policy tools, such as devaluing the
                              domestic currency, in response to the crisis. As shown in the following figures,
                              relatively high pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios coupled with rising fiscal deficits
                              caused sovereign credit spreads among these countries relative to Germany, the
                              largest and most creditworthy member of the EU, to widen dramatically. Later,

  some of these EU members adopted austerity measures to improve their fiscal
  governance and obtain support from stronger EU member states, which resulted
  in tighter sovereign credit spreads over time.

    The ratios in Exhibit 4 are used by rating agencies to gauge a country’s relative
debt burden and debt affordability in a similar manner to corporate financial ratios.
Exhibit 5 shows how these fiscal strength metrics align to Moody’s sovereign ratings,
for example. In the case of Moody’s and other rating agencies, these and other financial
metrics are not considered in isolation but rather are weighted and combined with
other factors in a comprehensive credit analysis.

      While Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia in terms of GDP
  on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, Malaysia has the smallest economy
  but by far the highest per capita GDP. Despite its size relative to its neighbors,
  the Malaysian economy is a relatively high-growth, competitive export-based
  economy focused on high technology products, such as electronics and health
  care. Malaysia’s growth, competitiveness, and stability are among the economic
  factors that have earned it the highest credit rating among the five countries
  (A3 from Moody’s and A from S&P).

                              and BB+ by Standard & Poor’s), Vietnam’s stable and high growth relative to its
                              neighbors contributed to a positive outlook from Moody’s and ratings upgrades

                               External Stability: A country’s external stability depends critically upon whether
                           foreign investors are able and willing to hold assets in a country’s currency. Countries
                           with actively traded currencies where foreign entities are significant investors in
                           domestic currency assets or those whose domestic currency is held in reserve by
                           other countries tend to exhibit greater external stability.
                               Key factors influencing whether a sovereign government with a non-reserve cur-
                           rency can meet external debt obligations include its external liquidity and solvency,
                           that is, the short- and long-term ability to generate sufficient, stable foreign currency
                           cash inflows that may be used to meet interest and principal payments on external
                           debt as well as other obligations to foreign investors.

                           Quantitative measures of external stability focus on the relative size of external debt as
                           compared to available sources of repayment. These sources include broad measures,
                           such as GDP, as well as foreign currency balances (i.e., reserves), or foreign currency
                           cash flows, often measured as currency account receipts. Current account deficits
                           and surpluses based on the international trade of goods and services offset changes

in a country’s capital account through capital inflows or outflows from abroad. Many
countries with FX reserves accumulate such balances through a current account
surplus with developed countries, while others benefit from foreign currency remit-
tances from citizens working abroad. Declining or volatile foreign currency balances
or cash flows reduce a sovereign borrower’s ability to service foreign currency debt.
While quantitative ratios provide a basis for comparison, it is important to consider
a number of factors, as outlined in the following example.

  A cursory comparison of ratios based upon currency reserves among the five
  Southeast Asian countries shown above suggests that Thailand should have the
  highest external creditworthiness among the five countries. In fact, Malaysia’s
  greater economic competitiveness and lower reliance on foreign currency-de-
  nominated debt actually results in higher external creditworthiness as measured
  by rating agencies (with a Moody’s external long-term foreign currency rating
  of A3 versus Baa1 for Thailand). Despite Thailand’s higher FX reserves to GDP,
  its foreign currency credit rating is the same as that for the Philippines. This
  is due in large part to the far greater proportion of Philippine workers abroad
  sending foreign currency to the country, which in 2020 comprised nearly 10%
  of GDP in the Philippines versus less than 2% in Thailand.

    In the case of emerging and frontier market countries where commodity exports
generate the bulk of foreign currency reserves, commodity demand and prices can
be primary factors driving sovereign creditworthiness. While countries facing strong,
stable commodity demand, such as oil-producing nations, often accumulate substantial
reserves and establish sovereign wealth funds to increase economic diversification,
adverse commodity price fluctuations can contribute to sovereign default, as in the
following case.

  Zambia’s Default in 2020
  The Republic of Zambia defaulted on a USD42.5 million Eurobond payment in
  November 2020, the first sovereign default following the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Zambia is Africa’s second-largest producer of copper, which comprises 60% of
  its exports. An economic slowdown due to COVID-19 accelerated a decline in
  copper prices beginning in 2014. By November 2020, Zambia’s annual inflation
  rate climbed to 17.4%, its highest level in four years. Additionally, the national
  currency, the kwacha (ZMK), depreciated 33% against the US dollar in 2020,
  creating more pain for Zambian consumers. Zambia’s total external debt had
  more than doubled in just five years, increasing from USD4.8 billion, or 18% of

                              to just 5% due to falling prices for its copper exports. This led to the inevitable
                              default on external debt and the consequent restructuring.


                            QUESTION SET


                              1. Which of the following statements best describes debt burden ver-
                                 sus debt affordability measures?
                                  A. Debt burden measures are similar to leverage, indicating a govern-
                                     ment’s relative solvency, while debt affordability measures provide a
                                     measure of debt coverage.
                                  B. A higher interest-to-GDP measure is associated with higher credit
                                     quality, while a lower debt-to-GDP ratio signals less credit risk.
                                  C. Higher debt to revenue is associated with greater credit risk, while a
                                     higher interest-to-revenue ratio signals higher credit quality.
                                 Solution: A is correct. B is incorrect, since a higher interest-to-GDP mea-
                                 sure is associated with lower credit quality, while a lower debt-to-GDP ratio
                                 signals less credit risk. C is incorrect, as higher debt to revenue is associat-
                                 ed with greater credit risk, while a higher interest-to-revenue ratio signals
                                 lower credit quality.

                              2. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: A key distinction
                                 for the creditworthiness of a sovereign government is whether its domestic
                                 currency is considered to be a __________ currency, that is, one that is fully
                                 convertible and held by foreign central banks and other investors. When
                                 foreign investors are able and willing to hold assets in a country’s currency,
                                 it greatly ___________ the government’s ability to access foreign investors
                                 using domestic currency debt.
                                 Solution:
                                 A key distinction for the creditworthiness of a sovereign government is
                                 whether its domestic currency is considered to be a reserve currency, that
                                 is, one that is fully convertible and held by foreign central banks and other
                                 investors. When foreign investors are able and willing to hold assets in a
                                 country’s currency, it greatly expands the government’s ability to access
                                 foreign investors using domestic currency debt.

                              3. Which of the following is a key ratio to measure the fiscal strength of a sov-
                                 ereign government?
                                  A. FX reserves to GDP
                                  B. Government interest payments to GDP
                                  C. GDP to population
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. Measuring a sovereign issuer’s relative fiscal strength depends
                                 upon both its current debt burden as well as the relative reliance on debt
                                 versus other financial resources. Debt burden measures provide an indi-
                                 cation of a government’s solvency, one of which is the level of government
                                 interest payments as a percentage of GDP.

      A is incorrect. Although FX reserves to GDP is a key ratio in determining
      the creditworthiness of a sovereign government, it is an external stability
      ratio, that is, a measure of foreign currency available to service foreign cur-
      rency debt payments.
      C is incorrect. GDP to population is a key ratio in determining the credit-
      worthiness of a sovereign government, but it is related to economic growth
      and stability rather than fiscal strength.

Non-Sovereign Government Debt
While sovereign issuers comprise the largest issuers of government debt, a number
of non-sovereign government issuers, such as government agencies or regional gov-
ernments, issue debt to finance their activities as well. In the case of government
agencies, investors typically face very similar credit risk to the sovereign given either
implicit government backing in the form of a sovereign law creating the entity and
granting it powers to raise debt, or explicit backing in the form of a guarantee. In the
case of sub-sovereign issuers with their own taxation and income-generating powers,
such as regional government issuers, they benefit from the economic and political

                           governance as well as monetary and fiscal policies of the sovereign as they fall under
                           its jurisdiction; still, they have a number of features that may cause their creditwor-
                           thiness to vary significantly from that of the sovereign issuer.
                                The main types of non-sovereign government issuers include agencies, public
                           banks, supranationals, and regional governments.


                           Agencies
                           Agencies are quasi-government entities whose primary activities are to fulfill a
                           government-sponsored mission to provide public services, often based upon a specific
                           sovereign law or statute. In many cases, either the law or statute creating the entity
                           authorizes it to finance its activities using debt. As quasi-government entities, investors
                           usually assume a high likelihood of sovereign government support, and rating agencies
                           typically grant the same rating to these entities as the sovereign entity.

                              of the world’s busiest cargo airports and a major passenger hub connecting to
                              over 200 global destinations. In late 2020, following a sharp decline in passenger
                              volume during the COVID-19 pandemic, AAHK announced a two-part, USD1.5
                              billion perpetual bond issuance to fund construction of a third runway and for
                              general corporate purposes. The issuance was evenly split between bonds with a
                              2.10% fixed coupon, which AAHK has the right to buy back after 5.5 years, and
                              those with a 2.40% fixed coupon, which AAHK can repurchase after 7.5 years.
                              The bonds were rated AA, one notch down from the long-term issuer rating of
                              AAHK, which was AA+ due to the buyback option. The long-term issuer rating
                              of AAHK was based on equalization with the Hong Kong SAR government
                              sovereign rating of AA+. The assumption supporting this rating is the implicit
                              support for AAHK expected from the Hong Kong SAR government in case of
                              any financial distress of AAHK.



                           Government Sector Banks and Development Financing
                           Institutions
                           Sovereign governments often sponsor the establishment of specialized financial inter-
                           mediaries to operate in a specific market or to promote specific sovereign political,
                           economic, social, or other growth and policy objectives. Similar to agencies, these
                           institutions are usually created or supported by the sovereign government and enjoy
                           a similar rating, as in the following example:

                            EXAMPLE 10

                              Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW)
                              Established in 1948 in the Federal Republic of Germany, KfW is the largest
                              national development bank (80% owned by the German federal government
                              and 20% by the federal states). It benefits from explicit and direct statutory

  guarantee and institutional liability by the Federal Republic of Germany. It
  is regulated by the “Law concerning KfW,” exempt from corporate taxes, and
  supervised by the German Federal Ministry of Finance and the German Federal
  Financial Supervisory Authority, better known as “BaFin.” KfW bonds receive
  a zero risk weighting under bank capital rules. Its bonds are rated AAA and
  “Prime” ESG rating. During 2020 its ESG commitment was to originate at least
  33% new business in environment and climate protection initiatives and 48%
  of new domestic business volume from small and medium-sized enterprises.
  To fund this business, KfW has been the most active issuer of Green Bonds in
  the international capital markets. It issued its first Green Bond in 2013, and it
  raised 20% of its new debt through Green Bonds (EUR16.2 billion in 2021), with
  total Green Bond issuance totaling EUR47.1 billion by 2021. The proceeds of
  Green Bond issuance are deployed in projects mitigating climate change in the
  categories of renewable energies and energy efficiency.



Supranational Issuers
So-called supranational entities are organizations that are established and owned
by sovereign governments that join as members to pursue a common objective.
For example, the World Bank and its affiliates, such as the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), issue debt to assist developing countries
with projects aimed at combating poverty and pursuing sustainable economic growth.
Examples of supranational entities with a regional focus include the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and the Development Bank of Latin America (Corporacion Andina de
Fomento, or CAF) in Latin America. Another example of a supranational entity is
provided in Example 11.

EXAMPLE 11

  Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF)
  The Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF) was established by the Government
  of the Republic of Indonesia (30% shareholding) along with World Bank (20%
  shareholding), ADB (20% shareholding), and other multilateral institutions,
  like KfW (15% shareholding) and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (15%
  shareholding). IIF was established in January 2010 to help accelerate and improve
  private participation in infrastructure development in Indonesia. IIF provides
  fund-based products, such as long-term loans, and non-fund-based products,
  such as guarantees and other services relating to infrastructure projects. IIF
  applies international social and environmental protection standards to ensure
  sustainability of infrastructure development in Indonesia. IIF’s credit rating is
  BBB, equivalent to the sovereign rating of the Government of Indonesia, based
  on its strategic importance as well as the implicit support and share ownership
  of global development institutions.



Regional Government Issuers
These include provincial, state, and local governments, referred to as municipal bonds
in the US and most often as local authority bonds elsewhere, within a specific sovereign
jurisdiction. Local government finance varies widely across countries. In some cases,
such as the Netherlands, the federal government has established a public financial
institution that offers financing to municipalities while establishing a structure that

                           grants them the same credit rating as the federal government. Other countries use
                           a tax revenue sharing system across sovereign and local governments to ensure that
                           local authorities are able to meet their obligations. In contrast, in the United States,
                           municipal issuers, such as state and local governments, are rated individually and
                           typically issue either general obligation or revenue bonds.

                           General Obligation Bonds
                           General obligation (GO) bonds are unsecured bonds that are backed by the gen-
                           eral revenues of the issuing non-sovereign government. These bonds are supported
                           by the taxing authority of the issuer. Revenue bonds are issued for specific project
                           financing—for example, financing for a new sewer system, a toll road, bridge, hospital,
                           or sports arena.
                               The credit analysis of GO bonds has some similarities to sovereign debt analysis
                           (e.g., the ability to levy and collect taxes and fees to service debt) but also some dif-
                           ferences. The attractiveness of the local business climate, presence of major industries
                           and employers to establish a diversified, stable corporate tax base, implicit national
                           government support in some cases, as well as the prudent management of state or
                           local government budgets all play an important role in establishing the relative cred-
                           itworthiness of the issuer. That said, non-sovereign governments have limited juris-
                           dictional powers and no control over sovereign economic and monetary institutions,
                           as is the case for sovereign issuers. Non-sovereign issuers may face greater exposure
                           to technological change, such as declining industries, and demographic changes, as
                           in the case of the largest US municipal bankruptcy filing presented in Example 12.

                            EXAMPLE 12

                              City of Detroit Bankruptcy Filing
                              The City of Detroit became the largest US municipal bankruptcy filing in 2013
                              following a decades-long decline in automotive industry employment and a
                              shift in manufacturing jobs to lower-wage Southern states. The result was a
                              demographic shift—causing the city’s population to decline from 2 million to
                              700,000—and increased racial tensions that accelerated a population shift out of
                              the city to the suburbs. The resulting declines in the property and income tax base
                              left Detroit with a shortfall in meeting payments on its estimated USD18 billion
                              in debt outstanding. The city was unable to reach an agreement with lenders,
                              unions, and pensioners, forcing it to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection.
                              After a 17-month negotiation period with its creditors, Detroit emerged from
                              bankruptcy after selling and pledging assets and offering concessions, with
                              pensioners retaining approximately 85% of their benefits and general obligation
                              unlimited tax bondholders recovering 74 cents on the dollar for their investments.


                           Revenue Bonds
                           Revenue bonds, which are issued to finance a specific project, have a higher degree
                           of risk than GO bonds because their cash flows are dependent upon a single source of
                           revenue. The analysis of these bonds is a combination of an analysis of the project and
                           the finances around the particular project. The project analysis focuses on the need
                           and projected utilization of the project, as well as on the economic base supporting the
                           project. This analysis has similarities to that of a corporate bond in that it is focused
                           on operating results, cash flow, liquidity, capital structure, and the issuer’s ability to
                           service and repay its debt based upon cash flow projections. Similar to corporate
                           debt, a key credit measure for revenue-backed non-sovereign government bonds is
                           the debt service coverage ratio, a measure of revenue available to cover principal

Non-Sovereign Credit Risk                                                                   399


and interest payments after operating expenses. The higher the coverage ratio, the
stronger the creditworthiness. Minimum coverage ratio covenants are a common
feature of revenue bonds. Coverage and other financial ratios are covered in greater
detail in the next learning module on corporate credit risk.
    In analyzing these bonds, the inherent riskiness of the cash flows becomes increas-
ingly important. Hence, not only are the underlying capacity and ability to raise revenue
through taxes and fees material, which is important for the sovereign bond evaluation,
but also an understanding of other repayment sources. This becomes particularly
material for various non-sovereign government infrastructure bonds, which may be
issued either by supranational entities or other quasi-governmental issuers, such as
airport authorities or public utility companies (for which the national government
may be a secondary implicit source of repayment in the event of a revenue shortfall).
An example of a non-sovereign government infrastructure project is described below.

EXAMPLE 13

   Lima Metro Line 2 Finance Limited
   Lima Metro Line 2 Finance Limited (Lima Metro 2) is one of the largest infra-
   structure debt offerings in Latin America and the largest RPI-CAO-backed
   offering to date. RPI-CAOs (Retribución por Inversión – Certificado de Avance
   de Obras) are a milestone payment, government-sponsored mechanism char-
   acteristic of the Peruvian infrastructure financing program.
       The RPI-CAO regime is a payment mechanism under which the concession-
   aire, Metro de Lima Línea 2 S.A., obtains the right to receive systematic payments
   as compensation for construction costs incurred for a project. RPI-CAOs are
   obtained after construction milestones are achieved and progress reports are
   submitted to, and approved by, the Ministry of Transport and Communications
   of Peru. These USD-denominated compensation rights are guaranteed by the
   Ministry and payable to the concessionaire following a specified installment
   schedule. RPI-CAOs are not direct sovereign obligations, but investors have
   recourse to the Peruvian government if the Ministry fails to make interest and
   principal payments.
       The bonds were issued to finance the construction of two routes of the
   subway system in the city of Lima, Peru, along with the related electromechan-
   ical equipment. The project involved the construction of 35 subway stations
   and approximately 35 kilometers of tunnels and courtyards. In April 2014, the
   Ministry entered into a concession agreement with Metro de Lima Línea 2
   S.A. (a consortium comprised of ACS Iridium, Vialia [FCC], Salini Impregilo,
   AnsaldoBreda, Ansaldo STS, and COSAPI, and the project equity sponsors) for
   the construction and operation of two underground railway lines.
       In June 2015, Lima Metro 2 issued USD1,150MM in 144A/Reg S senior
   secured notes at 5.875%. The 19.1-year notes had an average life at issuance of
   12.8 years and are rated Baa1 (Moody’s); BBB (S&P); and BBB (Fitch). The notes
   drew significant interest from asset managers and local Peruvian investors, with
   these investor bases comprising the majority of the final order book.

                            QUESTION SET


                              1. Which of the following statements best describes the relationship
                                 between local government and sovereign creditworthiness?
                                  A. Local governments have limited jurisdictional powers and no control
                                     over economic and monetary institutions.
                                  B. All sovereign governments use a tax revenue sharing system across
                                     sovereign and local governments to ensure that local authorities are
                                     able to meet their obligations.
                                  C. Local governments with the power to attract and retain major indus-
                                     tries and employers are often more creditworthy than their sovereign
                                     government.
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. Local governments have limited jurisdiction and no control
                                 over national fiscal and monetary policy. B is incorrect, as some, not all, sov-
                                 ereign governments use tax revenue sharing. C is incorrect. Since local gov-
                                 ernments are subject to the economic and monetary policy of the sovereign,
                                 their rating is typically equal or below that of the sovereign government.

                              2. Ile-de-France, the regional government of Paris, issued a green bond, the
                                 proceeds of which are to be used for investments including ecofriendly con-
                                 struction and renovation of buildings, public transport to support sustain-
                                 able mobility, and renewable energy projects. The bond is backed by the tax
                                 and other revenue of Ile-de-France. This bond is an example of:
                                  A. a general obligation (GO) bond.
                                  B. a revenue bond.
                                  C. an agency bond.
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. Though the proceeds of the bond are used for specific green
                                 infrastructure development, interest and principal payments are backed by
                                 the tax and other revenue of the local government rather than any specific
                                 project revenue.

                              3. Danainfra Nasional Berhad, a special purpose vehicle of the Government of

     port infrastructure in Kuala Lumpur. Interest and principal payments are
     supported by the cash flows of the mass rapid transport system and a credit
     guarantee of the Government of Malaysia. This bond is an example of:
      A. a general obligation (GO) bond.
      B. a revenue bond.
      C. an agency bond.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The funding is for the development of a specific mass rapid
     project for Kuala Lumpur, and the repayment is supported by the revenue of
     the mass rapid transport line. While the bonds also have a sovereign guaran-
     tee to provide credit enhancement, the primary source of repayment is mass
     transit revenue.

  4. A key credit measure for revenue-backed non-sovereign government bonds
     is:
      A. the debt service coverage ratio.
      B. level of unemployment in the local area.
      C. the tax base (depth, breadth, diversification, stability).
     Solution:
     A is correct. A key credit measure for revenue-backed non-sovereign
     government bonds is the debt service coverage ratio, which measures how
     much revenue is available to cover debt payments (principal and interest) af-
     ter operating expenses. This is because the repayment ability for the bond is
     directly linked to the revenue of the specific underlying project, rather than
     the general tax revenue of the state. Many revenue bonds have a minimum
     ratio covenant; the higher the debt service coverage ratio, the stronger the
     creditworthiness.

                               A. A country with a government budget surplus, current account surplus with
                                  high economic growth, and a freely floating currency.

                               B. A country with a government budget deficit, a current account deficit with
                                  moderate economic growth and a fixed exchange rate regime

                               C. A country with a government budget deficit, a current account deficit, low
                                  economic growth, and a fixed exchange rate regime.

                                SOLUTIONS
                           1. A is correct. This country exhibits fiscal stability as evidenced by its government
                              budget surplus, high economic growth, and external strength given its current
                              account surplus and freely floating currency.

                           2.

                           A. Low unemployment                                                        Positive
                           B. Low per capita income                                                   Negative
                           C. Low per capita debt                                                     Positive
                           D. Low tax base                                                            Negative
                           E. High dependence on sales tax                                            Negative
                           F. High post-retirement obligations                                        Negative

                                A. Positive, as low unemployment indicates a more productive and
                                income-generating population with potential for higher tax revenue.
                                B. Negative, as low per capita income reduces the potential for tax collection and
                                any potential tax raise.
                                C. Positive, as low per capita debt suggests a higher debt service ratio and greater
                                capacity for additional debt, if required.
                                D. Negative, a low tax base limits the potential for tax collection and significantly
                                weakens the potential for state revenue to meet expenses and service its debt.
                                E. Negative, as the more diversified the state’s revenue stream, the higher its
                                credit quality. Overreliance on a single revenue stream creates the potential for
                                volatility in case of any economic disruption.
                                F. Negative, as high post-retirement obligations indicate further state indebted-
                                ness, reducing its ability to service its debt.

                           3. C is correct. El Salvador is expected to have the lowest credit rating due to its
                              high long-term external debt-to-GDP ratio. While the Dominican Republic has
                              lower currency reserves than El Salvador, it also has a lower external debt burden
                              and higher economic growth.

                           4. B is correct. GIC is a supranational issuer, as it is sponsored and owned by mul-
                              tiple sovereigns. Its credit rating would be assessed as a supranational based on
                              weighted sovereign ratings of the sponsoring countries and the nature of their
                              implicit support in case of financial distress.

                           5. C is correct. A key factor influencing whether a non-reserve currency sovereign
                              government can meet external debt obligations is external liquidity and solven-
                              cy, or the ability to generate sufficient, stable foreign currency cash inflows to
                              meet interest and principal payments on external debt. A is incorrect, as capital
                              controls may restrict the ability to generate FX inflows. B is incorrect, as a fixed
                              exchange rate regime may cause instability in the case of currency devaluation.

                           6. A is correct. Since Agora has high external debt to GDP and is very dependent
                              on foreign currency inflows, it should seek to diversify its sources of foreign
                              currency to avoid financial distress in case of disruption in tourism revenue
                              or immigrant repatriation. B is incorrect, as maintaining or increasing foreign
                              currency reserves is important for debt service rather than reducing FX reserves.
                              C is incorrect. While the devaluation of Agora’s exchange rate versus foreign
                              reserve currencies may make it a more affordable tourist destination, it may also

Credit Analysis for Corporate Issuers
 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              describe the qualitative and quantitative factors used to evaluate a
              corporate borrower’s creditworthiness
              calculate and interpret financial ratios used in credit analysis
              describe the seniority rankings of debt, secured versus unsecured
              debt and the priority of claims in bankruptcy, and their impact on
              credit ratings




INTRODUCTION
In this learning module, we focus on the relative creditworthiness of non-financial
                                                                                            1
corporate borrowers, building on earlier learning modules on corporate issuers as well
as the earlier fixed-income module on credit risk and its components.
    In particular, we assess a company’s activities, or its business model, and how this
affects the company’s ability to meet its debt obligations. While a company’s probability
of default (POD) and loss given default (LGD) are not directly observable, in the first
lesson we consider qualitative and quantitative factors that affect these credit risk
components. Financial statement analysis and cash flow projections are important
tools used to conduct corporate credit analysis. The second lesson applies these tools
to calculate and interpret a variety of financial ratios, including profitability, lever-
age, and coverage metrics, to assess an issuer’s probability of default. The seniority
rankings of specific debt issues and use of collateral are of particular importance in
determining credit ratings for a corporate issue and assessing the LGD in an event of
default, which is addressed in the third and final lesson.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   The credit risk of a borrower can be evaluated using qualitative
           and quantitative criteria that affect a company’s likelihood of
           default and the investor’s loss in the event of a default.
       ■   Qualitative factors important in gauging creditworthiness include a
           company’s business model, its industry, and its competitive position
           and business risks, as well as its corporate governance

                                  ■   Quantitative factors in measuring creditworthiness involve financial
                                      statement analysis and forecasts, which use profitability, liquidity,
                                      leverage, and coverage measures to gauge a company’s ability to meet
                                      its fixed debt obligations.
                                  ■   Financial ratios are a critical tool used to assess the financial health of
                                      a company, identify trends over time, and compare companies within
                                      and across industries.
                                  ■   Seniority rankings determine the priority of claims on an issuer’s
                                      assets and are important determinants of the loss given default for a
                                      specific issue. Rating agencies typically provide both issuer and issue
                                      ratings for corporate credit.
                                  ■   While an issuer credit rating captures the probability of default or
                                      expected loss of the issuer’s senior unsecured bonds, an issue rating
                                      refers to specific financial obligations of an issuer and takes such fac-
                                      tors as seniority into account.



                            LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT


                              1. Which of the following is not a characteristic of higher corporate
                                 creditworthiness?
                                  A. Lower leverage
                                  B. Higher coverage
                                  C. Lower liquidity
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. All else held equal, a company with higher liquidity
                                 has a greater ability to meet its short-term obligations, including debt inter-
                                 est and principal.

                              2. All else being equal, a borrower will have higher capacity to repay its debt in
                                 an industry where the:
                                  A. barriers to entry are higher.
                                  B. threat of substitutes is higher.
                                  C. bargaining power of buyers is higher.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is A. An industry with higher barriers to entry tend to
                                 have lower threat of new entrants and lower competition. All else being
                                 equal, a borrower in such an industry has higher capacity to support its
                                 debt.

                              3. Identify the key credit metrics used in credit analysis:

                                 EBIT margin.

                                 Debt/EBITDA.

      A. Company X
      B. Company Y
      C. Company Z
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. Compared to Company X, Company Y has similar
     leverage metrics but better profitability and coverage. Compared to Compa-
     ny Z, Company Y has similar profitability and coverage but better leverage
     ratios. Also, when viewing all the metrics, Company Y has either the same
     value or better than the other two companies. Therefore, Company Y has
     the lowest credit risk among the three companies.

                                  B. issuer credit rating only.
                                  C. issuer and issue credit rating.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. An issuer rating usually applies to its senior unse-
                                 cured debt and is meant to address an obligor’s overall creditworthiness.
                                 All senior unsecured bonds are treated as one class and rank pari passu ir-
                                 respective of maturity. Therefore, both the issuer and the issue credit ratings
                                 are the same.

                                         describe the qualitative and quantitative factors used to evaluate a
                                         corporate borrower’s creditworthiness

                           A company’s creditworthiness depends primarily on its ability to generate profits and
                           cash flow sufficient to meet interest and principal payments. Analysts rely on both
                           qualitative and quantitative factors to evaluate both the likelihood of corporate default
                           as well as an investor’s loss in the event of a default. While several different analytical
                           models measure credit risk, here we focus on broad qualitative and quantitative factors.

                           company’s business model and the industry within which it operates, as well as the
                           competitive forces and business risks it faces. These factors are summarized in Exhibit 1.

Financial analysts evaluating a company’s business model, its industry, and its competi-
tive position and business risks from a debtholder’s perspective must not only consider
whether a firm generates an acceptable return over its cost of capital, but also whether
the timing and size of cash flows are sufficient to adequately cover debt obligations.
    Established firms with a business model characterized by stable and predictable cash
flows, low business risk, and less-competitive pressures have a higher capacity to use
debt in their capital structure and a lower likelihood of default than those firms with
lower and less stable cash flows, higher business risk, and/or greater competition. In
contrast to an equity analyst’s valuation of all future cash flows, fixed-income analysts
often focus on how a company’s creditworthiness may change over time given the
finite nature of short- and long-term debt claims, as shown in the following example.

   Qualitative Factors Affecting BRWA Creditworthiness
   Bright Wheel Automotive (BRWA), a hypothetical auto manufacturing firm
   mentioned in an earlier lesson, has a product line based on traditional internal
   combustion engine (“ICE”) technology. Having introduced its first electric vehicle
   (EV) two years ago, which comprises 5% of current revenue, BRWA’s manage-
   ment has ambitious plans to convert over half of its models to all-electric over
   the coming decade, while adopting hybrid (ICE and electric) technology for its
   remaining fleet over the same period. BRWA’s debt profile as an investment-grade
   corporate issuer is as follows:

                                   Qualitative factors, including BRWA’s business model, industry, and compe-
                              tition and business risk, affect the creditworthiness of its outstanding 150-day
                              commercial paper, five-year notes and fifteen-year notes.
                                   BRWA’s planned shift to a mostly EV-based product line over the next decade
                              mirrors changes announced by other global automobile producers as policymak-
                              ers seek to reduce vehicle emissions in the wake of climate change. The impact
                              of BRWA’s business model, industry, and competitive forces and business risk
                              on its outstanding debt may be described as follows:

                                   Business Model: BRWA’s established customer base and acclaimed ICE
                                   vehicle lineup have enabled it to maintain stable revenue growth and
                                   profitability to date, but the company’s technology and products must
                                   evolve over time to meet EV market demand. This business model change
                                   results in higher business risk.

                                   Industry and Competitive Environment: BRWA faces growing competi-
                                   tion within a fragmented global auto industry, with some competitors
                                   moving faster in establishing EV market share. Competition will intensify
                                   as other traditional ICE producers pursue a similar EV strategy amid
                                   potentially lower barriers to entry for pure EV companies, such as Tesla
                                   and software technology companies.

                                   Business Risk: The execution risk of the EV strategy significantly increases
                                   BRWA’s business risk. This is because the EV technology platform is not
                                   based on ICE technology, but rather on the integration of batteries, hard-
                                   ware, and software, increasing the bargaining power of BRWA’s supplier
                                   base.
                                  Consider BRWA’s debt outstanding as follows:

                                   Commercial Paper: Commercial paper investors face little to no exposure
                                   to BRWA’s long-term business strategy given the very short tenor of this
                                   debt. Investors will primarily focus on the company’s liquidity position
                                   based upon its existing ICE revenue base when assessing credit risk.

                                   Five-Year Notes: Investors in BRWA’s medium-term bonds face growing
                                   exposure to the greater competitive pressures and business risk associ-
                                   ated with BRWA’s EV strategy, but the company expects to generate most
                                   of its revenue from its traditional ICE customer base when the bond
                                   matures.

Assessing Corporate Creditworthiness                                                        413


       Fifteen-Year Notes: Investors in BRWA’s long-term bonds face the greatest
       risk to the company’s EV strategy and the associated competitive pres-
       sures and elevated business risk, as the company will make later interest
       and principal payments from cash flows that depend upon a successful
       EV transition.

    The BRWA debt issues highlighted in Example 1 are for general, unsecured claims
where company cash flows are the primary source of repayment. Secured debt, on
the other hand, designates specific company assets as collateral as a secondary source
of interest and principal payments. While the quality of a company’s assets is an
important factor for both unsecured and secured debt, secured lenders prefer to have
tangible (or hard collateral) rather than intangible (or soft collateral) assets promised
or pledged to secure debt. The value of collateral is most relevant for companies with
lower credit quality and of greatest importance to creditworthiness when a borrower’s
POD rises to a level where the collateral is necessary to protect the exposure. Tangible
assets are identifiable physical assets like property, plant and equipment, inventory,
cash, and marketable securities, whereas intangible assets include patents, intellec-
tual property rights, and goodwill. The use of collateral and secured debt can either
reduce the cost of borrowing versus unsecured alternatives or offer corporate issuers
access to debt markets that may otherwise not be available at all, as in the case of the
following example.

EXAMPLE 2

   Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines Secured Debt
   In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL)
   suspended its cruise operations in March 2020. Given the uncertainty surround-
   ing the length and severity of the health crisis, RCL took immediate steps to
   enhance liquidity, preserve cash, and obtain additional financing.
       The first of several RCL financings in that year took place in May 2020,
   when the company initiated a private offering of $3.3 billion in senior secured
   notes due in 2023 and 2025. The notes were secured by 28 of Royal Caribbean’s
   fleet of over 60 vessels and also included material intellectual property of the
   company. RCL used the proceeds of the bond to repay a $2.35 billion 364-day
   senior secured term loan agreement, with the remainder of the bond proceeds
   available for general corporate purposes. While the continued suspension of
   cruises due to the ongoing pandemic led to subsequent RCL convertible bond
   and equity issuances later in the year, the initial issuance of secured debt at
   the outset of the COVID-19 crisis represented a cost-effective alternative for
   the company to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility in the near term by
   pledging its tangible assets as collateral. Despite the increase in RCL’s POD due
   to the pandemic, investors were willing to provide debt financing in part due to
   the reduced LGD of the secured notes.

    Corporate governance is an important qualitative factor to consider when evalu-
ating corporate creditworthiness. While the assessment of an individual borrower’s
character is a common element of consumer credit analysis, it is more difficult in
practice to evaluate management’s character and the expected treatment of debthold-
ers for a publicly owned corporation or one that is privately held by investors and
private equity firms. Unlike equity investors with voting rights on important company
matters, debtholders seek to specify the use of debt proceeds as well as any borrower
restrictions at the time of issuance.

                               Highly rated issuers of unsecured debt are usually able to raise debt proceeds
                           for general corporate purposes with few restrictions that usually include affirmative
                           covenants only, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, maintaining
                           current lines of business, insuring and maintaining company assets, and paying taxes.
                           Credit analysts must evaluate management signals to make appropriate judgments
                           about the treatment of debtholders versus shareholders and the potential for dilution.
                               For high-yield issuers of secured debt, investors usually impose additional restric-
                           tions to protect bondholders if an issuer’s financial condition deteriorates, including
                           covenants restricting dividends or additional debt as well as financial covenants.
                           Management’s past track record in the treatment of bondholders is an important
                           consideration. For example, if management pursued business or financial strate-
                           gies that resulted in major credit rating downgrades—such as an overleveraged
                           debt-financed acquisition, a large debt-financed special dividend to shareholders, or
                           a major debt-financed stock buyback program—credit analysts should look closely
                           at the borrower’s character.
                               As in the case of equity analysts, credit analysts should also evaluate accounting
                           policies. Aggressive accounting policies mask the performance and the risk of the
                           underlying business and are potential warning flags to the true character of the busi-
                           ness and its leaders. Examples may include the use of significant off-balance-sheet
                           financing, the preference for capitalizing versus immediately expensing items, and
                           early and premature revenue recognition. Perhaps the most important red flag is
                           changing auditors or CFOs frequently. These potential warning flags, as well as any
                           evidence of fraud or malfeasance, may signal other behaviors or actions that may
                           adversely impact an issuer’s creditworthiness. A well-known example of accounting
                           fraud is provided below in Example 3.

                            EXAMPLE 3

                              Wirecard AG’s Accounting Fraud
                              Wirecard AG, a German payments firm that processed credit card and online
                              payments, enjoyed a meteoric rise following its 2005 listing on the Frankfurt
                              Stock Exchange. It joined the DAX index of the 30 most valuable companies
                              in Germany and reached a peak market capitalization of over EUR27 billion in
                              2018 before filing for insolvency in June 2020.
                                  A qualitative analysis of its management strategy and accounting policy in
                              the years prior to insolvency raises the following red flags about the company’s
                              character:
                                  After Wirecard received a banking license in 2006, it showed a significant
                              revenue growth and a rapid international expansion through acquiring legitimate
                              existing businesses, such as Citibank’s Asia-Pacific credit card processing arm.
                                  Wirecard’s opaque and overly complex business model masked rapidly rising
                              revenue and profit figures, giving rise to market rumors of suspicious transac-
                              tions and money laundering.
                                  While the company claimed thousands of small and medium-sized busi-
                              ness customers and dozens of partners globally as sources of revenue growth,
                              just three third-party partner companies provided a large share of Wirecard’s
                              reported revenue and most of its profits. Additionally, many of the firm’s assets
                              were held through external offshore trust accounts.
                                  Wirecard used its bank subsidiary as a lender to fintech partner companies,
                              as evidenced by the following excerpt from its half-year financial report dated
                              30 June 2019:

      “Wirecard does not only provide risk management, technology, and bank-
  ing services (to its fintech partner companies) but also sometimes provides the
  financing based on detailed individual assessments and suitable security mea-
  sures – often in the form of cash securities. This enables the Group, on the one
  hand, to increase the added value from its cooperation with FinTech companies
  and, on the other, to also significantly increase interest income.”
      The company filed for insolvency in June 2020 when auditors could not
  confirm the existence of EUR1.9 billion in cash, which comprised the bulk of
  Wirecard’s profits. It was later discovered that Wirecard’s revenue was depos-
  ited in escrow accounts held by third-party trustees, rather than paid to the
  company itself.
      After Wirecard was declared insolvent with debts of EUR3.2 billion, its share
  price immediately fell by over 70% and the price of its unsecured bonds fell to 20
  cents per EUR. CEO Markus Braun was arrested and later charged with fraud,
  breach of trust, and accounting manipulation following a criminal investigation.
  It was the biggest accounting fraud and bankruptcy in Germany’s post-World
  War II corporate history.


Quantitative Factors
Financial statement modeling and forecasting are a quantitative expression of analyst
expectations for a company’s future performance. Model inputs are based on an under-
standing of a company’s fundamental business drivers and an assessment of future risks
and opportunities. These inputs are derived using a top-down, macroeconomic or a
bottom-up, issuer-specific approach at the company level. In contrast to equity models,
which seek to value a firm’s stock based upon all cash flows available to shareholders,
quantitative credit analysis aims to estimate the likelihood that a company can meet
its debt obligations in the future. Exhibit 2 summarizes key quantitative factors used
to measure a corporate issuer’s credit risk.

416   Learning Module 16                                                     Credit Analysis for Corporate Issuers


                           Top-down analysis typically begins with a macroeconomic forecast, gauging a com-
                           pany’s growth relative to GDP, addressing a firm’s addressable market and market
                           share, and assessing the likelihood and impact of possible adverse events that may be
                           incorporated in a scenario analysis. For example, the economic cycle has a relationship
                           with the timing and severity of the credit cycle; thus, the credit cycle’s expected impact
                           on a specific company or industry is commonly used to gauge credit risk on a macro
                           level. Bottom-up analysis involves forecasting key revenue drivers and balance sheet
                           positions, while a hybrid approach might combine expected cyclicality with chang-
                           ing bottom-up features to forecast a company’s cash flows. The goal of quantitative
                           analysis is to identify key factors that drive a corporate issuer’s POD and how they
                           change over the credit cycle. These include the following factors:
                                  Profitability: Strong and stable earnings are important in generating the
                                  cash flows that are a primary source of debt repayment. Analysts gauging a
                                  company’s ability to make periodic fixed debt payments typically focus on
                                  operating profits and recurring revenues as opposed to non-recurring or
                                  one-time gains. Macro factors, such as an expected economic downturn for
                                  cyclical companies or a declining market share, can adversely impact future
                                  profitability.
                                  Leverage: Financial leverage measures a company’s relative reliance on debt
                                  financing in its operations. Measures of leverage typically compare the total
                                  level of debt to a firm’s resources as gauged by assets, capital, or a measure
                                  of profitability or cash flow. Given the fixed nature of debt claims, debt
                                  investors prefer lower leverage—that is, more resources per unit of debt—
                                  while equity investors usually benefit from more debt and higher financial
                                  leverage.
                                  Coverage: Lenders gauge creditworthiness by comparing periodic income
                                  measures or cash flows to debt service (interest and principal), interest, or
                                  debt-like payments, which include leases. Greater coverage means that debt
                                  investors benefit from higher income or cash flows from which fixed debt
                                  obligations can be paid.
                                  Liquidity: Debtholders evaluating near-term debt obligations for issuers with
                                  less stable cash flows often consider the availability of short-term resources
                                  to pay interest or principal. While a firm may be solvent (i.e., have assets in
                                  excess of liabilities and equity), it may nevertheless fail to meet its fixed obli-
                                  gations if it lacks cash or assets that can be readily converted into cash, such
                                  as marketable securities. Measures of liquidity also include committed bank
                                  facilities if a corporate borrower has the contractual right to draw down
                                  cash for the period in question.
                               The calculation and interpretation of these quantitative factors using financial ratios
                           is addressed in the next lesson. While investors in senior unsecured investment-grade
                           debt are almost solely focused on POD, high-yield investors in companies that use
                           subordination in their debt structure and/or collateral as a secondary source of
                           repayment also consider historical LGD rates and other factors in assessing credit
                           risk, which is the subject of the third lesson.

                           The use of financial ratios based upon the quantitative factors outlined in the prior
                           lesson allows credit analysts to assess the relative financial health of a company, identify
                           trends over time, and compare companies within and across industries with a focus
                           on profitability, coverage, and leverage. Common financial ratios used to evaluate a
                           corporate issuer’s credit risk are outlined in Exhibit 3.

                           In general, credit risk analysis using profitability, coverage, and leverage ratios seeks
                           to establish a firm’s ability to service cash flows from operating activities, as opposed
                           to asset disposals or financing activities. Cash flow measures used in credit analysis,
                           such as free cash flow (FCF, or net income less working capital increases, investment
                           in fixed assets, and net interest paid), funds from operations (FFO, or net income
                           from continuing operations, depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax, and
                           other non-cash items), or retained cash flow (RCF, or net cash flow from operating
                           activities less dividends paid) are more conservative than others because they make
                           certain adjustments for cash used in managing and maintaining the business or dis-
                           tributed to shareholders. Debt and interest expense measures used in credit analysis
                           also may be adjusted for operating leases, debt-like fixed lease payments, and/or other
                           fixed off-balance-sheet obligations that impact a company’s ability to service its debt.
                               These measures and the ratios developed based upon these measures are non-IFRS
                           in the sense that they do not have official IFRS definitions; the concepts, names, and
                           definitions given should be viewed as one usage among several possible, in most cases.
                               EBIT Margin: Credit analysts focus on EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to
                           determine a company’s operating performance prior to capital costs and taxes, since
                           interest expense is paid before income taxes are calculated. In some cases, EBITDA
                           (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense) is used
                           as a broader measure, which adds back (non-cash) depreciation and amortization
                           expense. Higher EBIT margins increase profits available to service debt.
                               EBIT to Interest Expense: This measures the degree to which operating profit cov-
                           ers periodic interest payments, with a higher coverage ratio representing less credit
                           risk. In some cases, the numerator is changed to include depreciation and amorti-
                           zation (EBITDA) as well as rental expense (EBITDAR), while the denominator may
                           be increased to include lease payments or reduced by interest earned on marketable
                           securities and cash.
                               Debt to EBITDA: Leverage ratios are often expressed with debt either in the
                           numerator or denominator, so care must be taken to reflect whether a greater or
                           lesser number reflects increased leverage. For example, a higher debt-to-EBITDA
                           ratio represents higher leverage, and debt may be adjusted to reflect operating leases
                           or off-balance-sheet commitments. Rating agencies often use it as a trigger for rating

actions, and banks reference it in loan covenants. A higher ratio indicates more leverage
and thus higher credit risk. Note that this ratio can be very volatile for companies with
high cash flow variability, such as those in cyclical industries and with high operating
leverage (fixed costs).
    Retained Cash Flow (RCF) to Net Debt: Use of cash flow rather than earnings
measures is also common in measuring leverage, while here the debt measure is
reduced by available cash. A higher RCF to net debt measure implies lower leverage.
    While financial ratios used in credit analysis vary across industries, the values of
financial ratios themselves for a given rating or level of credit quality may also range
widely across industries due to different business models, competitive pressures, and
other factors.
    Credit analysts use financial modeling to evaluate how these ratios might change
over time as revenue drivers change, as in the following example:

EXAMPLE 4

   Bowstream Corporation Credit Risk Assessment
   A credit analyst has created a financial statement model to evaluate the credit
   risk of Bowstream Corporation, a mid-sized, investment-grade consumer dura-
   bles company. While Bowstream’s most recent financial results show a solid
   10% sales growth and a robust 35% operating profit margin, the analyst would
   like to assess Bowstream’s performance under a downside scenario where the
   company’s production and interest costs rise due to inflation amid slower sales
   growth. Model assumptions used for Bowstream’s sales growth, cost of goods
   sold as a percentage of sales, interest rates, and debt growth over the next five
   years are as follows:

      Under this scenario, Bowstream faces declining profitability (as EBIT margin
  falls), weaker debt coverage (lower EBIT-to-interest expense), and increased
  leverage (a higher debt to EBITDA and lower RCF to net debt), which is likely
  to lead to wider credit spreads and a potential ratings downgrade.

    In order to measure these changes, analysts often compare existing and projected
ratios to industry and credit rating peers to determine expected future credit quality
changes as categorized by expected rating. For example, consider the following com-
parisons based upon Moody’s ratings methodology and these ratios for consumer

                           debt equally ranked and issued by one main operating entity. Other companies and
                           industries, due to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., media companies or conglomer-
                           ates) or regulation (e.g., banks and utilities), have more complex debt structures. Firms

debt with different seniority levels.


Seniority Rankings
A seniority ranking refers to the priority of payment, with the most senior or
highest-ranking debt having the first claim on the cash flows and assets of the issuer.
The level of seniority affects the value of an investor’s claim in the event of default
and restructuring. Secured debt involves a debtholder claim—a pledge from the
issuer—to certain assets and their associated cash flows. This collateral reduces the
lender’s potential loss in the event of default, as the lender may take possession of
and sell these assets to offset their losses. Seniority rankings involving secured and
unsecured debt are shown in Exhibit 4.

Secured versus Unsecured Debt
First mortgage and first lien debt are ranked highest among secured creditors in terms
of priority of repayment. First mortgage debt or loan refers to the pledge of specific
property (e.g., a power plant for a utility). First lien debt or loan refers to a pledge of
certain assets that could include buildings but might also include property and equip-
ment, licenses, patents, brands, or inventory. As the name implies, second lien secured
debt has a secured interest in the pledged assets that ranks below first lien debt in
both collateral protection and priority of payment. Most second lien loans are senior
secured obligations of the borrower, which rank above junior secured obligations.
    Unsecured bondholders have only a general claim on an issuer’s assets and cash
flows. In the event of default, unsecured debtholders’ claims rank below (i.e., get paid
after) those of secured creditors under what is known as the priority of claims.

                               The highest-ranked unsecured debt is senior unsecured debt. It is the most
                           common type of corporate bond, ranking below senior secured debt but above sub-
                           ordinated debt. Other, lower-ranked debt includes subordinated debt and junior
                           subordinated debt. Among the various creditor classes, these obligations have the
                           lowest priority of claims and frequently have little or no recovery in the event of
                           default (i.e., an LGD of 100%).
                               Different seniority rankings satisfy the needs and demands of both issuers and
                           investors. Issuers seek to optimize their cost of capital—in some cases offering secured
                           debt to meet investor requirements, as in the earlier Royal Caribbean example, and in
                           other cases offering subordinated debt, which is less costly than equity and non-dilutive.
                           The seniority of debt drives decisions in the case of bankruptcy or liquidation. Senior
                           creditors with a secured claim have the right to the value of specific assets before any
                           other claim. If the value of the pledged property is less than the amount of the claim,
                           then the difference becomes a senior unsecured claim. Senior unsecured creditors
                           take priority over all subordinated creditors, who in turn have the right to be paid in
                           full before shareholders receive any compensation. Example 5 shows differences in
                           repayment seniority.

Seniority Rankings, Recovery Rates, and Credit Ratings                                                       427


       While the 6.5% notes are senior secured debts, the 10.0% notes are unsecured
   subordinated debt.
       In an insolvency or a restructuring event, the 6.5% notes rank highest in the
   payment priority as they are backed by certain specified assets as a secondary
   source of repayment. If the value of the collateral falls short of the total amount
   of pari passu secured debt, the balance will rank pari passu with senior unsecured
   creditors in insolvency or restructuring.
       The 10.0% subordinated notes rank below senior secured and senior unse-
   cured debt in the priority of claims, but above junior subordinated debts (if any)
   and shareholders. These notes have among the lowest priority of claims in an
   event of default and often have the lowest recovery rate.



Recovery Rates
All creditors at the same debt seniority level are treated as one class; thus, a senior
unsecured bondholder whose debt is due in 30 years has the same pro rata (pari
passu) claim in bankruptcy as one whose debt matures in six months. Defaulted debt
often continues to trade near the expected recovery rate for bonds expected to enter
bankruptcy or liquidation. Recovery rates vary by seniority ranking based upon the
priority of claims.
    Historical default data provide statistically meaningful recovery rates by seniority
ranking. Exhibit 5 shows recovery rates by seniority ranking for North American
non-financial companies. For example, as shown in Exhibit 5, investors recovered
45.9% of the value of defaulted senior secured debt in 2019 but only 31.3% of defaulted
senior unsecured issues that year.

                           Recovery rates also vary depending upon when they occur in the credit cycle. When
                           the economy is strong or improving, robust markets exist for the resale of collateral
                           and recovery rates are therefore higher. Conversely, when the economy is weak or
                           weakening, lenders’ ability to liquidate assets at or near the original value is dimin-
                           ished and recovery rates fall.
                               Importantly, these recovery rates are averages, with high variability across indus-
                           tries and companies within a given industry. Factors include the composition and
                           proportion of debt across an issuer’s capital structure. An abundance of secured debt
                           will lead to smaller recovery rates on lower-ranked debt. Understanding recovery rates
                           is important because they are a key component of credit analysis and risk, as shown
                           in the following knowledge check.

KNOWLEDGE CHECK: EXPECTED LOSS


   1. The one-year forward default rate for an issuer in the automotive
      industry is expected to be 0.8%. What is the expected percentage credit loss
      of the issuer’s bonds under the historical recovery rate assumptions (see
      Exhibit 5)?
                                            ​




         Senior secured bond                                   58%
         Senior unsecured bond                                 46%
         Subordinated bond                                     23%
                                            ​




      Solution:
      Recall from an earlier lesson that:
      Expected loss (EL) = POD × LGD

      Senior secured bond: EL = 0.008 × (1 – 0.58) = 0.00336 = 0.336%

      Senior unsecured bond: EL = 0.008 × (1 – 0.46) = 0.00432 = 0.432%

      Subordinated bond: EL = 0.008 × (1 – 0.23) = 0.00616 = 0.616%

     The priority of claims in bankruptcy under which the highest-ranked creditors
get paid out first, followed by the next level, and so on, is a well-established legal
standard. However, creditors with lower seniority and even shareholders may receive
consideration without more senior creditors being satisfied in full, since bankruptcy
resolution takes time. By compensating subordinated debt holders, senior debt holders
can accelerate the bankruptcy process.
     During bankruptcy, legal and accounting fees can be substantial, and the company
value may decline as key employees and customers leave and competitors actively gain
market share. Claimants therefore have an incentive to negotiate and compromise,
leading to creditors with lower seniority and other claimants receiving more consid-
eration than they are legally entitled to.
     While a bias in the United States toward reorganization and recovery of compa-
nies in bankruptcy exists, elsewhere it is more common to liquidate companies in
bankruptcy and maximize value to bank lenders and other senior creditors. Since
bankruptcy and bankruptcy laws are very complex and can vary greatly by country,
it is difficult to generalize how creditors will fare under a default scenario.


Issuer and Issue Ratings
Rating agencies typically provide both issuer and issue ratings for corporate debt.
Terminology used to distinguish between issuer and issue ratings includes corporate
family rating (CFR) and corporate credit rating (CCR), or issuer credit rating and indi-
vidual issue credit rating. An issuer rating usually applies to its senior unsecured debt
and addresses an obligor’s overall creditworthiness. On the other hand, an individual
issue rating refers to specific financial obligations of an issuer and takes such factors
as seniority into account. While the probability of default (POD) for an issuer and
its issues may be the same due to cross-default provisions, issuer ratings may differ
due to loss given default (LGD) differences because of seniority, subordination, and
sources of repayment. This rating adjustment methodology is known as notching.

                              rate family rating (CFR), while the new unsecured debt issue was rated B2. The
                              company’s senior secured notes, on the other hand, were rated three notches
                              higher, or Ba2, due to the vessels and intellectual property used as collateral, as
                              described in Example 2.

                               While POD and LGD are the primary factors in assigning ratings, another factor
                           considered by rating agencies is structural subordination, which can arise when a
                           corporation with a holding company structure has debt at both its parent holding
                           company and operating subsidiaries. Operating subsidiary debt is serviced by the cash
                           flow and assets of the subsidiaries before funds can be passed (“upstreamed”) to the
                           holding company to service parent level debt.
                               Different payment priorities and possible higher (or lower) LGDs give rise to a
                           rating agency notching process where issue credit ratings are moved up or down
                           from the issuer rating. Generally, the higher the senior unsecured rating, the smaller
                           the notching adjustment due to a lower perceived risk of default. That is, the need to
                           “notch” the rating to capture the potential difference in loss severity is greatly reduced.
                           For lower-rated credits, however, the risk of default is greater and thus the potential
                           LGD difference in loss from a lower (or higher) priority ranking carries greater weight
                           in assessing an issue’s credit riskiness. Thus, the rating agencies will typically apply
                           larger rating adjustments. Rating agencies differ in their approaches, as discussed in
                           Example 7 below.

                            EXAMPLE 7

                              Different Approaches to Credit Ratings
                              While all the major rating agencies consider POD and EL in assigning their
                              credit ratings, which ultimately reflect the agencies’ forward-looking opinion of
                              the relative level of credit risk, nuanced differences exist between credit rating
                              agencies.
                                  For example, Moody’s defines credit risk as “the risk that an entity may not
                              meet its contractual financial obligations as they come due and any estimated
                              financial loss in the event of default or impairment.” In so doing, the rating
                              agency considers recovery as a rating factor in evaluating the creditworthiness
                              of debt (especially for speculative-grade debt). In other words, its rating scale
                              principally reflects EL.
                                  On the other hand, S&P Global Ratings assigns credit ratings that primarily
                              reflect POD. The agency issues separate recovery ratings in addition to rating
                              specific debt issues. These recovery ratings consider the relative seniority and
                              loss severity of particular issues in the event of default. S&P may also consider
                              recovery ratings in making its notching adjustments.

      Fitch Ratings takes a similar approach to S&P. Fitch assigns Issuer Default
  Ratings (“IDRs”) reflecting a POD view. Notching adjustments then apply to
  issue ratings by considering recovery expectations for specific issues.

QUESTION SET


  1. A company with the following simplified balance sheet faces im-
     pairment on its net current assets (other than cash) of USD90. Identify the
     potential recovery of the company’s debt according to the priority of claims
     in an event of default:
                                              ​




    Assets                              USD       Liabilities & Equity          USD

                                                  Secured bank loans (secured
    Cash                                 40       by cash collateral)            30
    Net Current Assets (other than
    Cash)                               100       Unsecured bonds                90
    Net Fixed Assets                     60       Subordinated bonds             10
                                                  Common shares                  40
                                                  Retained earnings              30
    Total Assets                        200       Total Liabilities & Equity    200
                                              ​




      A. Shareholders and subordinated debtholders receive zero recovery,
         while unsecured bondholders receive partial recovery.
      B. Unsecured debtholders receive zero recovery as the impairment equals
         the amount of unsecured debt outstanding.
      C. Subordinated and unsecured bondholders both face partial recovery,
         as the impairment is greater than the sum of these bonds outstanding.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The seniority ranking of the capital structure is as follows:
     Secured bank loans > Unsecured bonds > Subordinated bonds > Equity
     The USD90 impairment will initially be absorbed by the company’s most
     junior claim, equity (including common shares and retained earnings), with
     a total equity value of USD70 (40 + 30 = 70).
     The remaining USD20 (USD90 – USD70) impairment balance will be borne
     by the next junior claim, subordinated bonds. As subordinated bonds total
     just USD10, they have zero recovery.
     The remaining USD10 impairment is allocated to the unsecured bonds. The
     USD10 impairment reduces the recovery to USD80 (USD90 – USD10). The
     USD30 bank loans secured by cash collateral are unaffected, as the cash
     collateral value of USD40 fully covers this loan.

  2. State true/false to the following statement and explain your reasoning:
     Notching is the rating adjustment process whereby the credit rating of a
     corporate issuer can be moved up or down from the sovereign credit rating.
     Solution:
     False. Notching is the rating adjustment process whereby the credit rating of
     a bond can be moved up or down from the issuer credit rating.

                              3. Why is the probability of default likely to be the same for all unsubordinated
                                 bonds of an issuer?
                                 Solution:
                                 Cross-default provisions exist where an event of default on one bond trig-
                                 gers default on all outstanding debt, implying the same default probability
                                 for all issues. However, issue ratings may differ due to LGD differences.

                              4. An issuer credit rating assigned by the rating agencies reflects the:
                                  A. recovery rate of a specific debt of the issuer.
                                  B. expected credit loss of all the issuer’s outstanding debt.
                                  C. probability of default of the issuer’s senior unsecured debt.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. An issuer credit rating usually applies to the issuer’s
                                 senior unsecured debt and is meant to address the issuer’s overall creditwor-
                                 thiness in the form of probability of default (and for some rating agencies,
                                 both probability of default and expected recovery).

  PRACTICE PROBLEMS


The following information relates to questions
1-9
   The following questions are related to Mojofon Holdings:
   Mojofon Holdings specializes in the design, manufacturing, and marketing of its
   own branded smartphones. An evolving sector, the smartphone market is dom-
   inated by few large firms who together have close to 70% of the global market.
   Mojofon’s global market share is consistently around 3%, and it is positioned as a
   niche player.
   An industry assessment leads to the following observations:
   ■   Competition of the smartphone industry is intense, driven by consistent
       technology upgrades and new models with short product life cycles. The
       large investment and marketing budgets of dominant players have sustained
       high industry concentration.
   ■   New entrants positioned as niche producers of “cult” models like Mojofon
       consistently compete for market share.
   ■   Customers are “price-takers,” as smartphones are seen as a necessity. Pricing
       is usually set by the top three producers, and small firms have little pricing
       power. Surveys show that customers defer new phone purchases unless they
       have damaged their phones or there is a leap in technology.
   ■   Core mobile phone technology, such as semiconductor chips and mobile
       operating licenses, are concentrated among few key suppliers that command
       large profit margins at the expense of phone manufacturers.
   ■   Smartphone shipment has seen low growth in recent years due to market
       saturation and high penetration, limited technological advancement, and
       an economic slowdown. There are signs the sector is maturing. Industry
       concentration is increasing, with the top five firms accounting for 60–70% of
       global shipment and industry profit.

1. Based on her smartphone industry assessment, the credit analyst concludes that
   Mojofon’s debt service capacity is low because:
   A. the threat of substitutes is low.

   B. the threat of new entrants and bargaining power of customers are low.

   C. the industry rivalry and the bargaining power of suppliers are high.

2. Based on the overall industry assessment, the credit analyst concludes that the
   credit conditions for Mojofon will most likely:
   A. tighten because the sector is maturing, and industry concentration is
      increasing.

   B. remain unchanged because Mojofon’s market share is constant despite low
      industry growth.

                               C. expand since niche market entrants are consistently seizing market share
                                  from dominant firms.

                           3. Which of the following will most likely reduce Mojofon’s near-term default risk?
                               A. A new policy to increase dividends on a steady basis

                               B. A three-year strategy to pursue acquisitions funded by debt

                               C. Proactive management of debt maturity by issuing longer-term bonds

                           4. The credit analyst studies the key financial information of Mojofon and that of its
                              peers below:

                                                                          Mojofon                Peer Average
                                                                                                 Current Year

                               Debt/capital for Mojofon for the current year is closest to:
                               A. 37.5%.

                               B. 50.0%.

                               C. 100.0%.

                           5. The outstanding bonds of Mojofon contain a covenant that requires its EBITDA/
                              Interest coverage ratio to be above 3.0. Based on coverage ratio analysis, Mojofon
                              most likely:
                               A. has improved its coverage ratio.

                               B. is in breach of this bond covenant.

                               C. has lower credit risk than its peers.

                           6. Based on the financial information, Mojofon’s credit risk is:
                               A. below that of its peers.

                               B. similar to that of its peers.

                               C. above that of its peers.

7. Mojofon’s capital structure consists of the following:

         Type                                                    Amount

         Senior secured bonds                                       50
         (pledged by collateral valued at 60)
         Senior unsecured bonds                                     35
         Subordinated bonds                                         15
         Common equity                                             100

   Mojofon’s bonds all contain a cross-default provision. If the company is to default
   on one of its senior unsecured bonds:
   A. the secured bonds are likely to have full recovery.

   B. the credit loss on senior unsecured bonds will be the same as that on subor-
      dinated bonds.

   C. the subordinated bonds will rank below shareholders, who may dictate how
      recovery is to be distributed.

8. Half of Mojofon’s senior unsecured bonds are issued by its major operating
   subsidiary, which contributes over 90% of the group’s cash flow and assets, and
   the remainder of the group’s senior unsecured bonds are issued by the holding
   company that relies on dividend upstreamed by its subsidiaries. There is no
   cross-guarantee between the holding company and the subsidiary. In an event of
   default, it is most likely that:
   A. the unsecured bonds issued by the holding company will have a higher
      recovery rate.

   B. the unsecured bonds issued by the operating subsidiary will have a higher
      recovery rate.

   C. the recovery rate will be the same for all senior unsecured bonds since they
      rank pari passu with each other.

9. Mojofon’s S&P issuer credit rating is B+. Its S&P subordinated bond issue rating
   is most likely:
   A. BB –.

   B. B+.

   C. B –.

                           Industry rivalry                           High                      Low

                               Industry rivalry and bargaining power of suppliers are all high intensity, implying
                               low capacity to support debt.

                           2. The correct answer is A. If the industry is maturing with low growth and the
                              market becomes further concentrated among a few dominant firms, credit condi-
                              tions for smaller smartphone producers will most likely tighten.

                           3. The correct answer is C. Extending debt maturity proactively will help extend
                              Mojofon’s debt maturity profile and reduce near-term default risk. B is incorrect,
                              as debt-funded acquisitions reduce future cash flow certainty and increase credit
                              risk. A is incorrect since increasing the dividend is a shareholder-friendly action
                              that increases leverage and credit risk.

                           4. The correct answer is B. Debt/capital = Debt / (Debt + Equity)
                              = 100/(100 + 100) = 0.5 or 50% for Mojofon for the current year.

                           5. The correct answer is B. EBITDA/Interest coverage for Mojofon for the current
                              year = 20/8 = 2.5. The corresponding ratio for the prior year = 27/5 = 5.4. There-
                              fore, Mojofon’s coverage ratio has deteriorated, and the company has breached its
                              coverage ratio covenant (>= 3.0). On the other hand, EBITDA/Interest among its
                              peers = 55/10 = 5.5, which is much better than that of Mojofon. Based on cover-
                              age ratio analysis, Mojofon has higher, not lower, credit risk than its peers.

                           6. The correct answer is C. Despite the better profit measure, EBITDA margin, ver-
                              sus its peers, Mojofon’s cash flow measures, leverage, and coverage ratios are all
                              considerably worse than its peers. Therefore, it has higher credit risk.

                           7. The correct answer is A. Senior secured bonds rank the highest in the priority of
                              claims, and their recovery depends on the value of the asset collateral. Since the
                              value of asset collateral (60) exceeds the amount of secured bonds outstanding
                              (50), the secured bonds are likely to have full recovery in an event of default.
                              Senior unsecured bonds have higher priority over subordinated bonds, which in
                              turn have higher priority over common equity in insolvency.

                           8. The correct answer is B. Senior unsecured bonds issued by the holding company
                              are said to be structurally subordinated to those issued by the major operating
                              subsidiary. Debt at the operating subsidiary will be serviced by the cash flow and
                              assets of the subsidiary first before any funds can be upstreamed to the holding
                              company to service debt at that level.
                              Since the operating subsidiary accounts for over 90% of the group’s cash flow and
                              assets but only half of the group’s senior unsecured debt, the holding company
                              debt can only be serviced after the operating subsidiary debt is paid in full. The

   unsecured bonds issued by the subsidiary will most likely have higher recovery.

9. The correct answer is C. An issuer credit rating is the rating applied to a com-
   pany’s senior unsecured debt. The rating agency will usually apply a notching
   adjustment to the lower-ranked subordinated debt, whose rating should therefore
   be lower than that of the senior unsecured debt.

INTRODUCTION
Asset-backed securities (ABS) are securities backed by and repaid from a pooled group
                                                                                           1
of loans or receivables. Creating securities that are repaid from particular types of
loans or receivables transfers risk, provides flexibility to issuers and investors, and
efficiently allocates capital. In a securitization, cash flows from a designated pool of
assets are redistributed by a special purpose issuer to pay interest and principal to
investors in a predetermined manner. Thus, ABS transactions create an entire new
subordination structure on the designated pool of assets. Securitization takes place
around the world — in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. This first of three Fixed-Income
Learning Modules describes the benefits of securitization, the securitization process,
and typical securitization structures.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Securitization benefits investors by redistributing payment
          risks, enhancing the predictability of payments, diminish-
          ing the impact of unexpected changes in payment patterns (such as
          defaults, prepayments, or payment extensions), helping investors
          match risk, return and maturity needs, and reducing risk through vari-
          ous credit enhancements.
      ■   Securitization enables issuers to operate more efficiently on a risk-ad-
          justed basis by removing assets and lending risks from their balance
          sheets (thereby reducing their leverage), expanding their capacity to
          originate loans and to secure lower funding costs.
      ■   Securitization enhances financial market efficiency, improving overall
          liquidity in the financial system and reducing liquidity risk.

                                  ■   Several parties participate in a securitization, including the original
                                      corporate issuers of the assets (for example, loans, receivables, leases,
                                      or debt) to be securitized; a special purpose entity (SPE) created to
                                      buy/own these corporate assets, create new assets from them, and
                                      sell the new assets to investors; the servicer of the underlying loans or
                                      debt; and other (third-party) entities (for example, accountants, attor-
                                      neys, and underwriters).
                                  ■   When an original issuer elects to securitize assets, it first establishes
                                      an SPE to which it sells the assets. The SPE then issues and sells to
                                      investors securities backed by these assets. Interest and principal pay-
                                      ments on the assets are used to pay the investors in the new securities.
                                  ■   The separate legal entity structure of the SPE is designed to protect
                                      the underlying assets from any claims by creditors of the issuer should
                                      the issuer go into financial distress. However, ABS investors should
                                      evaluate the legal considerations of the actual jurisdiction where they
                                      purchase an ABS, since legal frameworks vary by country.



                            LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                              These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                              of understanding of this learning module.

                              1. Which of the following asset-backed securities (ABS) is most complex?
                                  A. Covered bonds
                                  B. Pass-through securities
                                  C. Collateralized mortgage obligations
                                 Solution
                                 C is correct. Collateralized mortgage obligations enhance the predictability
                                 of payment patterns of pass-through securities by redistributing the cash
                                 flows in the pool across the different tranches according to a preset sched-
                                 ule. A is incorrect because covered bonds are the simplest securitization
                                 structure. The issuer segregates (but retains) the underlying loans/assets and
                                 then uses the segregated loans/assets as collateral for the covered bonds it
                                 issues. B is incorrect because pass-through securities, while true securitiza-
                                 tions (meaning that the pool of assets is removed from the balance sheet and
                                 transferred into a separate and independent legal entity), are not as complex
                                 as collateralized mortgage obligations.

                              2. Which of the following legal documents in the securitization process de-
                                 scribes the structure of the securitization, including the priority of payments
                                 and the credit enhancements to be used?
                                  A. Prospectus
                                  B. Notes issued by the SPE
                                  C. Purchase agreement between the seller of the collateral and the SPE
                                 Solution
                                 The correct answer is A. The prospectus describes the structure of the secu-
                                 ritization, including the priority and amount of payments to be made to the
                                 servicer, administrators, and the ABS holders, as well as the credit enhance-
                                 ments used in the securitization. B is incorrect because the notes issued by
                                 the SPE are the actual asset-backed-securities (ABS), not legal documents

Introduction                                                                              441


     supporting the securitization process. C is incorrect because the purchase
     agreement between the seller of the collateral and the SPE outlines the rep-
     resentations and warranties that the seller makes about the assets sold.

  3. Identify the role that corresponds to each of the following participants in a
     securitization:
                                                ​




    1. Seller            A. The entity that issues the ABS
    2. Servicer          B. The entity that wishes to increase liquidity, lower funding
                         costs, and operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted basis
    3. SPE               C. The entity that collects payments from borrowers
                                                ​




     Solution

      1. B is correct. By removing assets and lending risks from their balance
         sheet, the seller can operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted basis.
         And, by selling the assets to an SPE, investors can rely on the default
         risk associated with collecting payments from customers, rather than
         the seller’s credit quality and default risk. As a result, in aggregate, the
         funding cost of a securitization may be lower than that of a corporate
         bond issue.
      2. C is correct. Loan servicing refers to administering any aspect of a
         loan, including collecting payments from borrowers, notifying bor-
         rowers who may be delinquent, and recovering and disposing of
         the underlying asset if the borrower does not make the payments as
         scheduled.
      3. A is correct. The SPE purchases the assets from the seller and then
         issues and sells ABS backed by the pool of securitized assets.

  4. Identify the benefit of securitization that corresponds most closely to each
     of the following parties: (A. Economies and Financial Markets, B. Issuers, C.
     Investors):
                                                ​




    1. By removing assets and lending risks from their bal-
    ance sheet, _________ can operate more efficiently on
    a risk adjusted basis. Ultimately, securitization enables
    ___________ to expand lending origination beyond their
    balance sheets.
    2. Securitization allows __________ to tailor interest rate
    and credit risk exposures to suit their specific risk, return,
    and maturity needs.
    3. Securitization creates tradable securities with higher
    liquidity than that of the original, thereby making
    ___________ more efficient, improving overall liquidity and
    reducing liquidity risk
                                                ​

                               a risk adjusted basis. Ultimately, securitization enables
                               ___________ to expand lending origination beyond their
                               balance sheets.

                               and credit risk exposures to suit their specific risk, return,
                               and maturity needs.
                               3. Securitization creates tradable securities with higher        B. Issuers
                               liquidity than that of the original, thereby making
                               ___________ more efficient, improving overall liquidity and
                               reducing liquidity risk
                                                                           ​




                                  1. A is correct. Securitization creates tradable securities with higher
                                     liquidity than that of the original, thereby making economies and
                                     financial markets more efficient, improving overall liquidity and
                                     reducing liquidity risk
                                  2. C is correct. Securitization allows investors to tailor interest rate and
                                     credit risk exposures to suit their specific risk, return, and maturity
                                     needs.
                                  3. B is correct. By removing assets and lending risks from their balance
                                     sheet, issuers can operate more efficiently on a risk adjusted basis.
                                     Ultimately, securitization enables issuers to expand lending origination
                                     beyond their balance sheets.




              2            THE BENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION

                                         explain benefits of securitization for issuers, investors, economies,
                                         and financial markets

                           The securitization process pools and transfers the ownership of cash flow generating
                           assets, such as loans or receivables, from the original lender into a specially created
                           legal entity. The pool of assets are the securitized assets, also called the reference
                           portfolio or collateral. In turn, that legal entity issues securities backed by these pooled
                           assets to investors and uses the cash flows to pay interest and repay the principal to
                           investors. Securitization creates a direct link between investors and borrowers for
                           many types of loans and receivables, and it provides benefits for issuers and investors
                           as well as economies and financial markets. The steps of the securitization process
                           are outlined in Exhibit 1.

There are several different types of securitized products. In order of increasing com-
plexity, the following products are examples of ABS.
   ■   Covered bonds are the simplest securitization structure. The issuers, mainly
       European banks, create a specific pool of mortgage loans on the balance
       sheet of the bank and segregate it from other bank assets. This pool then
       serves as collateral (“cover”) for bonds issued by the bank. Should the issu-
       ing bank default on a covered bond issue, investors can use the collateral
       underlying the pool to receive payment. Covered bonds are not considered
       full securitizations because the underlying assets are not transferred to a
       separate independent SPE but rather remain on the issuing bank’s balance
       sheet. Moreover, covered bond investors receive payment directly from the
       bank and not from the cash flow generated by the specific pool of mortgage
       loans.
   ■   Pass-through securities are true securitizations: The specific pool of assets
       is removed from the balance sheet and transferred into a separate and
       independent legal entity. That legal entity then issues securities backed by
       these pooled assets. The investors in these securities receive the principal
       and interest payments from the assets (often loans) in the pool as they are
       “passed through” the legal entity. Pass-through securities pass through the
       payments proportionally across the different tranches and redistribute the
       payment risks to investors seeking differing levels of risk exposures. The
       payments investors receive vary and depend directly on the overall credit
       risk of the pool and payment patterns.
   ■   Bonds with structural enhancements enhance the predictability of pay-
       ment patterns of pass-through securities by redistributing the cash flows in
       the pool across specified tranches according to a preset schedule. The set
       payment schedule mitigates the impact of unexpected changes in payment
       patterns, such as defaults, prepayments, or extended repayment periods.
       Additionally, tranches are subordinated with lower tranches assuming
       greater risks of defaults and changes in repayment patterns than higher
       tranches. They may further mitigate and redistribute the potential credit
       risk of a risky pool of securitized loans by adding various types of credit
       enhancements to further reduce the risk investors are exposed to.
   ■   Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are ABS backed by a pool of mort-
       gages. A distinction is sometimes made between MBS and ABS backed by
       non-mortgage assets. This distinction is common in the United States and is
       shown in Exhibit 2.

                                                                          Equity ($10)

                           Subordination, or tranching, in the securitization transaction involves creating more
                           than one bond class or tranche, and the bond classes differ in how they receive cash
                           flows from the underlying pool of assets. The bond classes are classified as senior
                           bond classes or subordinated bond classes, and this structure is also referred to as
                           a senior/subordinated structure as seen in Exhibit 3. The subordinated bond classes
                           are sometimes called “non-senior bond classes” or “junior bond classes.” Since all
                           investors in a securitization are paid from the same underlying cash flow pool, the
                           tranching dictates the order of payments made to investors and the order in which
                           losses are absorbed by the investors.


                           Benefits to Issuers
                           Traditionally, banks underwrite loans to allow borrowers to finance various purchases
                           and direct investments. These bank loans, which typically remain on the balance sheet
                           of the bank until the loans are fully repaid, are relatively illiquid.
                               Banks act as the intermediary between borrowers and investors. If they can sepa-
                           rate loan origination from loan financing, they can improve their profitability, earning
                           origination fees and reducing capital requirements for loans that are sold to investors,
                           as shown in Exhibit 4. As we learned in the example on asset-backed commercial
                           paper (ABCP) in an earlier learning module, by removing assets and lending risks

from their balance sheet, banks sell illiquid assets and operate more efficiently on a
risk-adjusted basis. Selling assets also generates fee income. Ultimately, securitization
enables banks to expand lending origination beyond their balance sheets.

Without ABS as an investment instrument, investors wanting to gain exposure to
private debts would have to directly underwrite loans, hold some combination of bank
debt and common equity, or purchase loans from bank outright. Direct debt under-
writing requires specialized skills in credit evaluation, origination, underwriting, and
servicing, and one has to assume the operational costs and business risks of banking.
ABS investment breaks down the wide range of skills and risks and redistributes them
to appropriate parties.


Benefits to Investors
Securitization provides a direct conduit between borrowers and investors, allowing
investors to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their specific risk,
return, and maturity needs. Securitization transactions allow issuers to design risk–
return characteristics to satisfy the risk tolerance of investors.
    Although few institutional or individual investors have the specialized resources
and expertise needed to originate, monitor, and collect the payments from the
underlying loans and receivables, many can invest in securities backed by such loans
or receivables. The ABS that are created by pooling these loans and receivables have
characteristics similar to those of a standard bond.
    For example, a pension fund with a long-term horizon can use securitized debt
to achieve higher returns, match asset maturities to anticipated liability payout
dates, and increase diversity in its asset pool while maintaining the option to adjust
holdings quickly and cost-effectively. Thus, holding securitized debt helps pension
fund investors increase exposure to the risk–return characteristics of a wider range
of underlying assets.

EXAMPLE 1

   Benefits of Securitized Debt for Long-term Investors
   Pawas Singhvi, an investment manager for a defined benefit pension fund at a
   large manufacturer, is discussing investment options and expectations with a new
   associate, Kevin Epstein. Epstein asks why Singhvi holds a significant portion of
   fund assets in securitized debt. Singhvi explains that a number of parameters and
   expectations influence the investments selected for the pension fund, starting
   with asset and income diversification. The fund seeks safe, diversified assets and
   income streams, which offer low risk. Anticipated pension payments or outflows

                              from the fund drive the need for liquid and stable investments, which mature
                              or can be sold easily to match the timing of required cash outflows. Any fund
                              investments must be highly rated.
                                  Because pension payouts take place over many years into the future, pension
                              assets must be invested long-term, too. And the fund’s assets must grow over
                              time in order to produce promised pension payments at the levels required in
                              the future. While public, government-issued debt is highly rated and typically
                              safe, it alone may not produce sufficient returns to meet future obligations. By
                              contrast, holding investment-grade, publicly traded, securitized debt, which can
                              be traded, allows us to garner higher returns and to respond quickly to changes
                              in market sentiment, risk sensitivity, or funding needs at low transaction costs.



                           Benefits to Economies and Financial Markets
                           Securitization creates tradable securities with higher liquidity than that of the origi-
                           nal loans on the bank’s balance sheet, and trading securities in the secondary market
                           allows investors to determine equilibrium prices—thereby making financial markets
                           more efficient. Securitization also improves overall liquidity in the financial system
                           and reduces liquidity risk.
                               An important benefit of securitization is that it provides an alternative means of
                           funding business operations beyond traditional financing tools, such as bonds, preferred
                           equity, and common equity. Companies can use securitization to reduce their funding
                           costs by pooling securitizable assets (often receivables and loans), which increases
                           their return on capital versus borrowing though traditional financing methods.
                               Securitization is beneficial to financial markets. Corporate issuers can facilitate
                           the process of selling their products by extending credit to their customers, usually
                           through their financing subsidiary. These subsidiaries specialize in financing and leas-
                           ing and often issue much of the corporation's consolidated debt, selling receivables
                           either to a bank or directly to an SPE. The company can then securitize these loans,
                           receiving cash from the SPE that then sells them to investors. A company can use these
                           proceeds to fund financing for new customers and sell even more of their product. If
                           the company instead kept these loans to customers on their own balance sheet, they
                           would have to issue additional debt. That would increase their leverage, increase their
                           overall financing and funding costs, and reduce their credit quality. Securitizing loans
                           for their products allows companies to directly tap the financial markets and move
                           loans off their balance sheet. They can thus capture the benefits of a cheaper source
                           of funding without reducing the company’s overall credit quality.
                               Securitizations may involve any number of revenue-generating assets owned by
                           companies from a variety of industries. Securitization provides efficiencies to the entire
                           system, benefiting many parties. Manufacturers are able to outsource debt servicing,
                           consumers benefit from reduced costs, and investors benefit from diversified invest-
                           ment opportunities. The following are some interesting examples of securitizations.

                            EXAMPLE 2

                              Examples of Securitizations
                              Notes securitized by music royalties and licensing agreements (which allow places
                              such as restaurants or retail stores to play popular music) have been issued. In
                              2019, the performing-rights company, SESAC, issued securitized bonds backed
                              by its music royalties and licensing agreements with more than 30,000 artists,
                              including Adele, Bob Dylan, Kesha, Gabriel Mann, and R.E.M. The largest piece
                              of the securitization was a fixed-rate note, worth $530 million with a weighted

The Benefits of Securitization                                                                447


   average life of 6.7 years. The note offered a yield of 5.25%. The smaller portion
   of the deal was a floating-rate note, worth $30 million with a weighted average
   life of 4.9 years, which was not publicly offered. This type of offering is known
   as a “whole-business securitization.” This type of bond usually is backed by such
   assets as restaurant franchise agreements or other unusual assets and typically
   pays higher rates than more traditional ABS tied to consumer debt.
        In 2021, Yum! Brands, the parent company of such fast-food chains as KFC,
   Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, issued USD2.3 billion in notes securitized by cash
   flows from franchised Taco Bell locations through a special purpose subsidiary,
   Taco Bell Funding.

    Although securitization brings many benefits to economies, it is not without risks.
Broadly, these risks fall into two categories: risks that relate primarily to the timing of
the ABS’s cash flows, such as contraction risk and extension risk, and risks related to
the inherent credit risk of the loans and receivables backing the ABS. Later modules will
address how securitization structures reduce these risks. Some of these risks are widely
attributed to have precipitated the turmoil in financial markets during 2007–2009.

      1. By removing assets and lending risks from their balance sheet, banks
         can sell illiquid assets and operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted
         basis.
      2. Selling assets also generates fee income.
      3. Ultimately, securitization enables banks to expand lending origination
         beyond their balance sheets.

   2. Identify two benefits of securitization to investors.
      Solution

      1. Securitization allows investors to tailor interest rate and credit risk
         exposures to suit their specific risk, return, and maturity needs.
      2. Securitization allows investors to gain exposure to a wider range of
         imperfectly correlated assets to build more efficient and diversified
         portfolios.

   3. Matching asset maturities to anticipated liability payout dates and increas-
      ing diversity in an asset pool while maintaining the option to adjust holdings
      quickly and cost-effectively is most likely a benefit to:
      A. issuers.
      B. investors.
       C. economies and financial markets.
      Solution
      The correct answer is B. Matching asset maturities to anticipated liability
      payout dates and increasing diversity in an asset pool while maintaining the
      option to adjust holdings quickly and cost-effectively is most likely a benefit
      to investors. For example, a pension fund with a long-term horizon can use
      securitized debt gains to achieve higher returns, match asset maturities to

                           Securitization requires that several legal and regulatory conditions are satisfied and
                           involves multiple parties to facilitate the transaction and ensure that these conditions
                           are met. This section describes a typical securitization process, the parties, and their
                           roles.

An Example of a Securitization
Let’s revisit Bright Wheel Automotive (BRWA), the hypothetical car manufacturer
introduced earlier. BRWA’s financing company subsidiary provides loans to BRWA
customers with the vehicles serving as collateral. These fixed-rate loans represent an
asset to the company with maturities averaging four years. They are fully amortizing
with the principal repaid in 48 monthly payments (12 months × 4 years). The borrow-
ers make equal payments each month consisting of interest payment and principal
repayment, as shown in Exhibit 5.

BRWA’s financing subsidiary decides whether to extend credit to customers, and it
also services the loans. Loan servicing refers to administering any aspect of a loan,
including collecting payments from borrowers, notifying borrowers who may be
delinquent, and recovering and disposing of a vehicle if the borrower does not make
the payments as scheduled. If a customer defaults, BRWA can seize the car and sell
it to recoup the remaining principal on the loan. The role of the servicer can vary: In
this example, the issuer continues to service the loan, but at other times, the servicing
may be provided by another entity.
     The following is an illustration of how these loans can be securitized. In this
simplified example, the costs and fees associated with the securitization are ignored.
Exhibit 6 shows a summary of the terms for a securitization transaction where BRWA
sold car loans to a hypothetical SPE named Car Loan Trust (CLT), which then uses
the loans as collateral for ABS it issues.

                                                      (BRWA), sold by BRWA to CLT, purchased by CLT, and fully
                                                      transferred from BRWA to CLT.
                                                      There are 45,000 loans in the outstanding pool, with an average

                           Maturity Date:             [Four Years from Settlement Date]
                           Security:                  The Notes are secured obligations of CLT.
                           Business Days:             Frankfurt.

                           Assume that BRWA wants to raise EUR1,000 million and faces two choices. One is to
                           issue a four-year corporate bond; the other is to issue an ABS backed by the car loans.
                           BRWA seeks to achieve the lowest possible interest rate relative to its benchmark
                           interest rate, where the difference is the credit spread.
                               Unlike banks and finance companies, car manufacturers are more capital-intensive.
                           Tying up capital on their balance sheet to finance car purchases may be a suboptimal
                           use of their capital. Selling off loans frees up capital and recognizes profits that can
                           finance the core business.
                               First, BRWA sets up a separate legal entity called Car Loan Trust (CLT), a special
                           purpose entity (SPE), sometimes also called a special purpose vehicle (SPV) or a special
                           purpose company, to which it sells the EUR1,000 million worth of car loans. CLT, a
                           legally independent and bankruptcy-remote entity from BRWA, acquires these loans
                           from BRWA and becomes the ultimate owner of the loans. The separate legal entity
                           structure ensures that if BRWA, the originator of the loans, files for bankruptcy, the
                           loans backing the ABS that are issued by BRWA are secure within CLT, the SPE, and
                           BRWA’s creditors cannot have any claim on them. Creating the required separate and
                           bankruptcy-remote legal structures for the SPE and fully transferring the loans from
                           the issuer to the SPE can be a complicated process that varies across jurisdictions.
                               Exhibit 7 reflects BRWA’s business: (1) selling cars financed by loans, (2) BRWA
                           sells to CLT EUR1,000 million worth of car loans, and (3) BRWA receives from CLT
                           EUR1,000 million in cash.

Exhibit 9 shows (6) how the monthly payments made by BRWA’s customers, which
include both interest payment and principal repayment, go to the special purpose
entity CLT, which then (7) directs the agreed periodic cash payments to the investors
in the ABS. Exhibit 9 also summarizes the full set of steps in a typical securitization.
It shows the parts played by all parties, including the company wanting to securitize
its assets, the issuer (SPE), as well as customers and investors.

                           Parties to a Securitization
                           The three main parties to a securitization are:
                               ■   the seller of the collateral, sometimes called the depositor (BRWA in our
                                   example);
                               ■   the SPE that purchases the loans or receivables and uses them as collateral
                                   to issue the ABS, CLT in our example (the SPE is often referred to as the
                                   issuer in the prospectus because it is the entity that issues the securities);
                                   and
                               ■   the servicer of the loans (BRWA’s financing subsidiary in our example).
                               Other parties, such as independent accountants, lawyers/attorneys, trustees,
                           underwriters, rating agencies, and sometimes financial guarantors, are also involved
                           in these transactions. Since these parties are different from the seller of the collateral,
                           they are referred to as third parties to the securitization.
                               Besides the standard bond indenture and its covenants, two additional legal doc-
                           uments play an important role in the securitization process. One is the purchase
                           agreement between the seller of the collateral (the original lender) and the SPE, which
                           outlines the representations and warranties that the seller makes about the assets sold.
                           These representations and warranties assure investors about the quality of the assets,
                           an important consideration when assessing the risks associated with the ABS. The
                           other is the prospectus, which describes the structure of the securitization, includ-
                           ing the priority and amount of payments to be made to the servicer, administrators,
                           and the ABS holders, as well as the credit enhancements used in the securitization.
                               A trustee or trustee agent is known as a “disinterested trustee” and is typically a
                           financial institution that safeguards the assets after they have been sold to the SPE,
                           holds the funds due to the ABS holders until they are paid, and provides periodic

The Securitization Process                                                                  453


cash flow reports to ABS holders as agreed to in the terms of the prospectus. These
reports are the only source of information for investors to update the credit standing
of the ABS.


The Role of the SPE
The legal protection the SPE creates for the originator or issuer and the investors in
an ABS transaction plays a pivotal role in securitization. Without an SPE, securitiza-
tions would not be possible. Securitization can be a cheaper way to raise funds than
a corporate bond issue secured by the same collateral because the SPE is not affected
by the bankruptcy of the seller of the collateral.
    In a securitization, the courts in most jurisdictions have no discretion to change
seniority because the bankruptcy of the originating company does not affect the SPE.
Hence removing assets from the balance sheet into an SPE is an important decoupling
of the credit risk of the entity needing funds from the SPE and the bond classes issued
by it. This explains why the SPE is structured as a bankruptcy-remote entity and why
the legal separation from the issuer and the SPE is critical.
    The only credit risk that the investors face is the risk that the borrowers whose
loans are included in the SPE default on their loans. The SPE’s ability to make cash
payments to the security holders remains intact if the borrowers make the interest
payments and/or the principal repayments on their loans.
    In many countries, the creditors are protected in the recognition of the securiti-
zation as a true sale, where all rights of the lender are irrevocably, unqualifiedly, and
fully transferred to the SPE according to the laws of the jurisdiction. The SPE has full
legal ownership of the securitized assets, which are de-recognized from the seller’s
balance sheet. Note that it is possible that transfers made to bankruptcy-remote vehi-
cles, such as an SPE, can be challenged as fraudulent transactions or conveyances in
court and if so determined, potentially unwound.
    It is also important to note that not all countries have the same legal framework.
Impediments with respect to ABS issuance have arisen in some countries where the
concept of trust law is less well developed. Thus, investors should evaluate the legal
considerations that apply in the jurisdictions where they purchase ABS.

QUESTION SET

   Questions 1 to 4 are based on the following example:
      Ahbaling Industries (Ahbaling), a manufacturer of industrial machine
   tools based in Johor, Malaysia, has SGD500 million of corporate bonds out-
   standing. These bonds have a credit rating below investment grade. Ahbaling
   has SGD400 million of receivables on its balance sheet that it would like to
   securitize. The receivables represent payments Ahbaling expects to receive for
   machine tools it has sold to various customers in Europe. Ahbaling’s finance
   subsidiary sells the receivables to Ahbaling Trust, an SPE. Ahbaling Trust then
   issues ABS, backed by the pool of receivables, with the following structure:

                              1. Identify the correct order for the following steps related to securitizing
                                 receivables of Ahbaling Industries:
                                                                        ​




                                                   A. Investors buy securities based on their preferred level of
                                                   risk and return.
                                                   B. Ahbaling pools SGD400 million in receivables.
                                                   C. Ahbaling sells machine tools on credit.
                                                   D. ABS are issued.
                                                   E. Segregated receivables are sold to Ahbaling Trust.
                                                                        ​




                                 Solution
                                                                        ​




                               Step 1              C. Ahbaling sells machine tools on credit.
                               Step 2              B. Ahbaling pools SGD400 million in receivables.
                               Step 3              E. Segregated receivables are sold to Ahbaling Trust.
                               Step 4              D. ABS are issued.
                               Step 5              A. Investors buy securities with their preferred level of risk
                                                   and return.
                                                                        ​




                              2. If Ahbaling Industries issues SGD400 million in corporate bonds one year
                                 from now:
                                  A. the new bonds will be senior to the ABS.
                                  B. the ABS will be senior to the new bonds.
                                  C. seniority will not apply between the new bonds and the ABS.
                                 Solution
                                 The correct answer is C. Since the new bonds are issued by Ahbaling
                                 Industries and the ABS are issued by Ahbaling Trust, two distinct entities,
                                 seniority will not apply.

                              3. Investors considering the purchase of the ABS bonds will rely most on:
                                  A. the financial health of Ahbaling Trust.
                                  B. the financial health of Ahbaling Industries.
                                  C. the default risk associated with collecting payments from Ahbaling
                                     customers.
                                 Solution
                                 The correct answer is C. As long as Ahbaling’s customers make the interest
                                 payments and/or principal repayments on their loans, Ahbaling Trust will
                                 be able to make cash payments to the ABS investors. The legal implication
                                 of setting up Ahbaling Trust is that investors contemplating the purchase
                                 of any ABS backed by the cash flows from the pool of Ahbaling receivables
                                 will evaluate the default risk associated with collecting the payments from
                                 the machine tool customers. The credit quality and default risk of Ahbaling
                                 Industries are no longer directly relevant.

                              4. Identify the most important reason why the ABS issued by Ahbaling Trust
                                 offers a lower interest rate than the existing Ahbaling Industries corporate
                                 bonds outstanding.
                                  A. Ahbaling Industries’ existing bonds are rated below investment grade.

      B. Ahbaling Trust would not be affected if Ahbaling Industries files for
         bankruptcy.
      C. The ABS issued by Ahbaling Trust are secured by collateral, the receiv-
         ables purchased from Ahbaling Industries.
     Solution
     The correct answer is C. A secured bond is secured by collateral and is
     considered less risky than an unsecured bond without collateral backing,
     and accordingly, has a lower credit spread than an unsecured bond. A is
     incorrect because the credit rating on Ahbaling Industries’ existing bonds
     does not dictate the interest rate on the ABS issued by Ahbaling Trust. B
     is incorrect because even though Ahbaling Trust, as a separate legal entity,
     would not be affected if Ahbaling Industries files for bankruptcy, this is not
     the most important reason that the ABS require a lower interest rate.

                              PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                           1. Which of the following benefits of securitization is most likely to be important
                              for investors?
                               A. Increased efficiency

                               B. Reduced liquidity risk

                               C. The ability to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures



                           The following information relates to questions
                           2-4
                               AR&C Limited leases private jets to corporations in North America for a fixed
                               term of five years. AR&C retains ownership of the jets. The corporations make
                               equal interest payments each month. If a customer defaults, AR&C can repossess
                               the jet. AR&C has been in business for approximately fifteen years and has a B3
                               credit rating, meaning that its debt is non-investment grade. AR&C has CAD500
                               million in leases on its balance sheet, which it wants to securitize into ABS.

                           2. Determine which of the following is the best next step for AR&C.
                               A. AR&C issues and sells securities backed by the pool of leases.

                               B. AR&C sets up a separate legal entity to which it sells the CAD500 million in
                                  leases.

                               C. AR&C discontinues servicing the leases, shifting this responsibility to a
                                  special purpose company.

                           3. Which shape best represents the cash payments for the Leases?

                                        AR & C                        1.                          Customers

   SOLUTIONS
1. The correct answer is C. Securitization provides a direct conduit between bor-
   rowers and investors. It also allows investors to tailor interest rate and credit risk
   exposures to suit their specific risk, return, and maturity needs. A is incorrect
   because securitization creates efficiency for issuers and financial markets more
   directly than for investors. Securitization allows issuers to sell illiquid assets and
   operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted basis. Moreover, because securitiza-
   tion creates tradable securities with higher liquidity than the original underlying
   assets, it makes financial markets more efficient. B is incorrect because securi-
   tization improves overall liquidity in the financial system and reduces liquidity
   risk, which benefits participants in financial markets.

2. The correct answer is B. In order for these assets (leases) to be securitized, they
   must be held in a separate legal entity structure distinct from AR&C. The sepa-
   rate legal entity structure ensures that if AR&C, the originator of the leases, files
   for bankruptcy, the leases backing the ABS that are issued by the separate legal
   entity are secure there, thus AR&C’s creditors cannot have any claim on them. A
   is incorrect because if AR&C issues the securities, the leases remain on AR&C’s
   balance sheet and thus could still be accessible to AR&C’s creditors in the event
   of a bankruptcy. C is incorrect because servicing the leases must continue wheth-
   er or not by AR&C or another entity, but servicing the leases is separate from
   securitizing them.

3. The correct answer is B. As shown in the diagram below, the SPE (in rectangle
   9 above), pays AR&C for the leases (as noted in shape 3 above). A is incorrect
   because shape 2 above represents the sale of the leases (as shown in the diagram
   below), not the payment for them, and C is incorrect because shape 5 above
   represents payments from the investors for the ABS sold by the SPE (as shown in
   the diagram below).

4. The correct answer is C. The SPE purchases the leases from AR&C and uses them
   as collateral for the ABS, which it issues and sells to the investors. A is incorrect
   because AR&C is the seller of the collateral, not the SPE. C is incorrect because

                               the diagram does not show clearly who services the leases, but it does show that
                               the entity in shape 9 is the SPE.

                           5. The correct answer is B. An important benefit of securitization is that it provides
                              an alternative means of funding business operations beyond traditional financing
                              tools, such as bonds, preferred equity, and common equity. A is incorrect be-
                              cause securitization improves overall liquidity in the financial system and reduces
                              liquidity risk. C is incorrect because securitization allows companies to directly
                              access the financial markets and move loans off their balance sheet.

                           6. The correct answer is A. The ABS that are created by pooling loans and receiv-
                              ables have characteristics similar to those of a standard bond. B is incorrect
                              because it is a correct statement. Holding securitized debt helps pension fund
                              investors increase exposure to the risk–return characteristics of a wider range of
                              underlying assets. C is incorrect because it is a correct statement. Securitization
                              transactions allow issuers to design risk–return characteristics to satisfy the risk
                              tolerance of different investors.

                           7. The correct answer is C. Since the SPE, which owns the loans, is bankruptcy
                              remote from the seller of the collateral, the bankruptcy of the seller of the collat-
                              eral will not affect the holders of securities issued by the SPE and backed by the
                              collateral. The only credit risk that the investors face is the risk that the borrowers
                              whose loans are included in the SPE default on their loans.

                           8. The correct answer is A. The SPE is often referred to as the issuer in the prospec-
                              tus because it is the entity that issues the securities to investors. B is incorrect
                              because the seller of the collateral, also called the depositor, is the party that orig-
                              inally aggregated the assets and sold them to the SPE. C is incorrect because the
                              servicer has an administrative function and is the entity that collects payments
                              from borrowers.

INTRODUCTION
Prior Learning Modules have shown the funding technique of securitization can
                                                                                         1
be backed by diverse types of assets, including loans and receivables as well as res-
idential or commercial mortgages. A unifying principle in all asset-backed security
(ABS) structures is that their underlying cash flows can be reconfigured into various
tranches, each with its particular payment pattern to investors and associated risks.
The advantage of this targeted partitioning includes a reduction in the variability of
cash flows and the reallocation of risks, such as default and early repayment across
specific tranches, with associated returns. Overall, ABS securitization provides risk
transfer, flexibility to issuers and investors, and efficiency of capital allocation.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Covered bonds are issued by financial institutions as senior
          debt obligations. Backed by a segregated pool of assets typ-
          ically consisting of commercial or residential mortgages, or public
          sector assets, these assets remain on the issuer’s balance sheet.
      ■   Non-mortgage ABS are securitizations that remove the pool of assets
          from the original issuer’s balance sheet. They are generally collat-
          eralized by non-amortizing loans, such as credit card receivables,
          that retain their original loan value during a specific period of their

                                      life before the stated maturity date, known as the lockout or revolv-
                                      ing period. During this time, principal that is repaid is reinvested to
                                      replenish the collateral pool.
                                  ■   Collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a generic term describing
                                      securitization backed by diversified collateral pools of non-mortgage
                                      debt (such as bonds or loans) that redistribute segmented cash flows
                                      to investors. The CDO’s tranches receive the cash flows according to
                                      an order of priority, with senior claims having lower bond-like pay-
                                      outs and junior claims receiving potentially higher but more variable
                                      returns.
                                  ■   The most common CDO structure is a collateralized loan obligation
                                      (CLO) and is subject to uniquely complex non-linear risks in cases of
                                      collateral defaults.
                                  ■   Credit tranching, which involves creating distinct senior and subordi-
                                      nated bond classes (“tranches”), offers credit protection for the more
                                      senior bond classes in a securitization. Senior bond classes are paid
                                      from the underlying asset pool before subordinated tranches; subordi-
                                      nated bond classes absorb any cash flow losses resulting from defaults
                                      in the asset pool before senior tranches.
                                  ■   Creating a set of bond classes allows investors to choose the level of
                                      risk, expected maturity, and the associated returns they prefer. Each
                                      bond class created in a securitization is typically rated based on both
                                      the quality of the underlying collateral and the seniority of the class.

                              1. Which of the following types of descriptive information is typically
                                 excluded from an ABS term sheet?
                                  A. Conditions for early amortization
                                  B. Market values of the tranche notes
                                  C. Aggregate amount of collateral pool assets
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. The term sheet typically provides the face value of
                                 the tranche notes at the time of the transaction, not their market value. Both
                                 A and C are incorrect as these items are typically included in the term sheet.

                              2. After the lockout period for ABS with non-amortizing collateral, how are
                                 the cash flows for loan repayments directed?
                                  A. All of the principal is reinvested to acquire additional loans.
                                  B. Part of the principal is reinvested if the collateral pool is depleted.
                                  C. No principal is reinvested, and all is distributed to different tranches.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. When the lockout period is over and the amortiza-
                                 tion period starts, any principal that is repaid will not be reinvested in new
                                 loans but will be distributed to the different tranches.

                              3. The prevailing CDO structure is the:
                                  A. CLO.

Introduction                                                                             463


      B. CMO.
      C. Structured finance CDO.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is A. Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have a col-
     lateral pool composed of loans. B is incorrect because while similar, CMOs
     are based on mortgages. C is incorrect because it is based on a portfolio of
     other CDOs.

  4. Which of the following statements about CLOs is accurate?
      A. The CLO replicates the firm’s capital structure.
      B. Purchases of a CLO’s collateral are funded by issuing equity.
      C. A CLO’s junior tranche earns a potentially higher yield than compara-
         ble corporate bonds.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is A. Fundamentally, a CLO replicates the capital
     structure of the firm. B is incorrect because CLO collateral purchases rely
     on funds obtained from the issuance of debt. C is incorrect because it is the
     senior of mezzanine tranches that earn a potentially higher yield than com-
     parable corporate bonds.

  5. Which of the following aspects of their transaction structures is most likely
     shared by solar ABS, CLOs, and covered bonds?
      A. A pre-funding period
      B. An unstable collateral pool
      C. A diversity of default exposures
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. All these ABS lack a stable initial asset pool and re-
     quire ongoing collateral management. A is incorrect because a pre-funding
     period is used by solar ABS post transaction to acquire additional qualifying
     assets that meet certain eligibility criteria. C is incorrect because covered
     bonds have only one bond class with its associated default exposure in its
     cover pool.

  6. Which internal credit enhancement involves creating bond classes that
     differ in how they share any losses resulting from defaults in the collateral
     pool?
      A. Subordination
      B. Overcollateralization
      C. Cash collateral accounts
     Solution:
     The correct answer is A. Subordination or credit tranching in the securitiza-
     tion transaction involves creating more than one bond class or tranche, and
     the bond classes differ in how they share any losses resulting from defaults
     in the collateral pool. B is incorrect because overcollateralization is an inter-
     nal credit enhancement in which the collateral underlying the transaction is
     larger than the face value of the issued bonds, so that even if defaults are in
     the pool, the transaction has sufficient cushion to continue paying principal
     and interest payments on the bonds. C is incorrect because it is a type of
     external, not internal, credit enhancement.

                              7. Which of the following statements about covered bonds is incorrect?
                                  A. The LTV on the mortgages included in the transactions must meet
                                     certain standards to be eligible for inclusion in the pool.
                                  B. Covered bond transactions typically involve collateral underlying the
                                     transaction that is less than the face value of the issued bonds.
                                  C. Redemption regimes exist to align the covered bond’s cash flows with
                                     the original maturity schedule in the event of default of a covered
                                     bond’s sponsor.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. Covered bond transactions typically involve collat-
                                 eral underlying the transaction, which exceeds the face value of the issued
                                 bonds referred to as overcollateralization. A is incorrect because it is a
                                 correct statement. The loan to value (LTV) on the mortgages included in the
                                 transactions must meet certain standards to be eligible for inclusion in the
                                 pool. If a mortgage fails to meet the LTV criteria, it is replaced with another
                                 mortgage that meets the criteria. C is incorrect because it is a correct state-
                                 ment. Redemption regimes exist to align the covered bond’s cash flows as
                                 closely as possible with the original maturity schedule in the event of default
                                 of a covered bond’s financial sponsor.

                                 schedule?
                                  A. Soft-bullet covered bonds
                                  B. Hard-bullet covered bonds
                                  C. Conditional pass-through covered bonds
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. For hard-bullet covered bonds, if payments do not
                                 occur according to the original schedule, a bond default is triggered and
                                 bond payments are accelerated. A is incorrect because soft-bullet covered
                                 bonds delay the bond default and payment acceleration of bond cash flows
                                 until a new final maturity date, which is usually up to a year after the origi-
                                 nal maturity date. C is incorrect because conditional pass-through covered
                                 bonds convert to pass-through securities after the original maturity date if
                                 all bond payments have not been made.

                           Covered bonds, which we touched on in earlier readings, are senior debt obligations
                           issued by a financial institution and backed by a segregated pool of assets that typically
                           consist of commercial or residential mortgages, or public sector assets. Covered bonds
                           that are backed by ships and commercial aircraft have also been issued.

    The covered bond (or Pfandbrief in German) originated over 250 years ago in
Prussia and has been adopted by issuers in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Each country
or jurisdiction specifies eligible collateral and structures permissible in the covered
bond market, and the European Union is taking steps to harmonize these elements
among its member states. Exhibit 1 provides a typical structure for a covered bond
transaction.

Covered bonds are similar to ABS. However, the loans remain on the issuer’s balance
sheet and are ringfenced into a separate cover pool. The investors in the covered bonds
have dual recourse in case of bankruptcy: first on the ringfenced loans in the cover
pool that underlie the covered bond transaction, and second on the unencumbered
assets of the issuing institution.
    Covered bond transactions financing environmental remediation projects and
investments in renewable energy production and infrastructure are increasingly popular.
The cover pools for these green covered bonds are largely made up of mortgages to
green buildings, which can be identified through various green building certification
standards.
    Typical covered bond terms issued by Commercial Finance Partners are found
in Exhibit 2. The mortgages underlying the transaction remain on its balance sheet.

                           Covered bonds usually consist of one bond class per cover pool. Another important
                           feature lies in the dynamic nature of the cover pool. The assets in the pool are mon-
                           itored by a third party for performance and adherence to underwriting standards.
                           Moreover, the covered bond issuer must replace any prepaid or non-performing
                           assets (i.e., assets that do not generate the promised cash flows) to ensure sufficient
                           cash flows until the maturity of the covered bond.
                               Covered bonds offer two additional tools to mitigate the risks of investors. First,
                           covered bond transactions typically involve collateral underlying the transaction which
                           exceeds the face value of the issued bonds, referred to as overcollateralization. For
                           instance, Germany requires that all covered loan collateral pools are overcollateral-
                           ized by at least 2% of the economic value of the outstanding covered bonds and some
                           German issuers voluntarily overcollateralize their covered bond issues. Second, the
                           loan to value (LTV) on the mortgages included in the transactions must meet certain
                           standards to be eligible for inclusion in the pool. If a mortgage fails to meet the LTV
                           criteria, it is replaced with another mortgage that meets the criteria.
                               Redemption regimes exist to align the covered bond’s cash flows as closely as
                           possible with the original maturity schedule in the event of default of a covered
                           bond’s financial sponsor. For example, in the case of hard-bullet covered bonds, if
                           payments do not occur according to the original schedule, a bond default is triggered
                           and bond payments are accelerated. Soft-bullet covered bonds delay the bond default
                           and payment acceleration of bond cash flows until a new final maturity date, which
                           is usually up to a year after the original maturity date. Conditional pass-through
                           covered bonds, in contrast, convert to pass-through securities after the original
                           maturity date if all bond payments have not yet been made.
                               Covered bonds have remained a relatively stable and reliable source of funding over
                           time because of their dual recourse nature, strict eligibility criteria, dynamic cover pool,
                           and redemption regimes in the event of sponsor default. As a result, covered bonds
                           usually carry lower credit risks and offer lower yields than otherwise similar ABS.

                            EXAMPLE 1

                              Comparing Covered Bonds and ABS at Banks
                              “Ultimately, covered bonds and ABS are complements, not substitutes. ABS
                              are a vehicle for packaging and selling exposure to private credit risk, with the
                              promise of the higher returns that holding such risk entails. Covered bonds are
                              a means for banks to raise long-term funding at a lower cost than if they issued
                              unsecured debt. The assets underlying a covered bond simply enhance the issu-
                              er’s promise to pay back the loan and are not intended to offer exposure to the
                              underlying pool of assets. “These differences between the two instruments are
                              reflected in their payment structure: ABS typically pay floating interest rates and
                              pass through any early payments; covered bonds typically pay a fixed interest
                              rate and mature on a fixed date, like any other type of bond.
                                  “Although there may be disadvantages to banks selling the loans that they
                              originate, there are also advantages. Securitization increases the financial system’s
                              capacity to lend in a way that covered bonds do not. By moving loans off the
                              originating bank’s balance sheet, securitization reduces the amount of capital

  (reserves) that the bank must hold to back its loans. As a result, banks can make
  more loans with the same amount of capital. Covered bonds, which keep the
  loans on the banks’ balance sheets, do not offer this benefit.”

QUESTION SET


  1. Determine whether the following statement is true or false, and ex-
     plain your reasoning.

     In covered bond transactions, loans in the cover pool stay on the issuer’s
     balance sheet.
     Solution:
     True. While covered bonds are similar to ABS, the loans composing the cov-
     ered bond collateral remain on the issuer’s balance sheet and are ringfenced
     into a separate cover pool.

  2. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: To further _______ inves-
     tor risks, covered bond transactions are typically _______ to some _______
     percentage of their cover pool’s economic value.
     Solution:
     To further reduce investor risks, covered bond transactions are typically
     overcollateralized to some greater percentage of their cover pool’s economic
     value.

  3. Identify the covered bond type that corresponds to its correct characteristic:

      i.     New form with payment lapse

      ii.    Quickest triggering of defaults

      iii.   New maturity date with payment lapse
                                                    ​




    A. Hard-bullet
    B. Soft-bullet
    C. Conditional pass-through
                                                    ​




     Solution:
                                                    ​




    A. Hard-bullet                                       ii. Quickest triggering of defaults
    B. Soft-bullet                                 iii. New maturity date with payment lapse
    C. Conditional pass-through                          i. New form with payment lapse
                                                    ​




      A. ii is correct. With hard-bullet bonds, if payments do not occur accord-
         ing to the original schedule, a bond default is triggered and bond
         payments are accelerated.
      B. iii is correct. Soft-bullet bonds delay the bond default and payment
         acceleration of bond cash flows until a new final maturity date, which
         is usually up to a year after the original maturity date.

                                  C. i is correct. Conditional pass-through bonds convert to pass-through
                                     securities after the original maturity date if all bond payments have
                                     not yet been made.

                              4. Which of the following statements about covered bonds is correct?
                                  A. Covered bonds have a single recourse nature.
                                  B. Covered bonds have lower credit risk and offer lower yields than oth-
                                     erwise similar ABS.
                                  C. Covered bonds are removed from the issuer’s balance sheet and are
                                     ringfenced into a separate cover pool.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. Covered bonds have remained a relatively stable
                                 and reliable source of funding over time because of their dual recourse na-
                                 ture, strict eligibility criteria, dynamic cover pool, and redemption regimes
                                 in the event of sponsor default. As a result, covered bonds usually carry
                                 lower credit risks and offer lower yields than otherwise similar ABS.
                                 A is incorrect because covered bonds have a dual recourse nature. The in-
                                 vestors in the covered bonds have dual recourse in case of bankruptcy: first
                                 on the ringfenced loans in the cover pool that underlie the covered bond
                                 transaction, and second on the unencumbered assets of the issuing institu-
                                 tion. C is incorrect because the loans remain on the issuer’s balance sheet
                                 and are ringfenced into a separate cover pool.

                           us call this class Bond Class A. Returning to the Bright Wheel Automotive (BRWA)
                           and Car Loan Trust (CLT) hypothetical example, CLT may raise EUR1,000 million
                           by issuing 1,000,000 certificates for ABS Bond Class A with a par value of EUR1,000
                           per certificate. Thus, each certificate holder is entitled to 1/1,000,000 of the payments
                           from the collateral, after payment of servicing and other administrative fees. In this
                           case, the investors will be exposed directly to the default risk of the assets of the pool
                           as well as other risks that impact the payments to the pool. There are different credit
                           enhancement approaches the SPE can pursue to mitigate the impact of these risks
                           on the investors.
                               These are achieved by creating securitization structures with multiple classes of
                           ABS debt issued.


                           Credit Enhancement
                           Most securitization structures involve multiple different tranches where each of the
                           tranches plays a different role; often, one tranche assumes risk from other tranches.
                           Credit risk is a core risk that securitization structures seek to mitigate through credit

enhancement, a type of financial support that absorbs losses from defaults on the
underlying loans. Three main types of internal credit enhancements are widely used
in securitization transactions:
    As introduced in Lesson 1 on covered bonds, overcollateralization involves a
provision that a bond’s collateral value exceeds the face value of the issued bonds.
Even if there are defaults in the pool, the transaction has sufficient cushion to con-
tinue paying principal and interest payments on the bonds. Revisiting our previous
example of the notes issued by Car Loan Trust, if the value of the loans and leases
underlying the EUR1,000 million securitization is EUR1,200 million, there is EUR200
million overcollateralization. If the car loans perform poorly, let’s say 10% default,
there is still EUR1,080 million collateral to cover losses from other defaults. This
additional cushion makes both the senior and subordinated tranches more attractive
to potential investors.
    Excess spread is the difference between the coupon on the underlying collateral
and the coupon paid on the securities. For example, if the average loan in the CLT
example generates 8% but the securities issued from the pool earn 6%, then the excess
spread of 2% can absorb collateral shortfall or be used to build up reserves.
    Subordination or credit tranching in the securitizationtransaction involves
creating more than one bond class or tranche, and the bond classes differ in how
they share any losses resulting from defaults in the collateral pool. The bond classes
are classified as senior bond classes or subordinated bond classes; this structure is
also referred to as a senior/subordinated structure. The subordinated bond classes
are sometimes called “non-senior bond classes” or “junior bond classes.” Since all
investors in a securitization are paid from the same underlying cash flow pool, the
tranching dictates the order of payments made to investors and the order in which
losses are absorbed by the investors.
    There are also external credit enhancements, such as financial guarantees by
banks or insurance companies, letters of credit, and cash collateral accounts, which
we do not cover here.

EXAMPLE 2

  Overcollateralization
  In November 2013, SolarCity, a predecessor organization of Tesla Energy, issued
  the first-ever US public solar ABS (SOCTY 2013-1) backed by USD54.425 million
  of bundled cash payments. This ABS allowed SolarCity to access a relatively cheap
  source of funding. Normal monthly payments by customers purchasing solar
  power from SolarCity generated the income stream used to pay ABS investors.
  The collateral comprised 5,033 photovoltaic (PV) systems located across 14
  states, 143 counties, and 53 utility service territories. The bonds had a weighted
  average life of 7.05 years and a BBB+ credit rating from S&P, and they provided
  a 4.8% annual return to investors through 2026. The investment-grade rating
  meant pension funds and other regulated investment vehicles could own the ABS.
      The ABS were overcollateralized versus the face value of the bonds, which
  meant that the ABS buyers received more collateral in case of default than the
  USD54.425 million purchase value. This overcollateralization was one of the
  reasons that the ABS received an investment-grade credit rating (BBB+ by
  S&P). The overcollateralization was also significant in facilitating the offering’s
  4.8% interest rate, which was a low cost of capital for solar developers. The 4.8%
  interest rate was only about 0.50% higher than the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
  at that time. Lastly, the high amount of overcollateralization was required given
  that this was the first publicly known solar ABS, and investors needed to be
  comfortable in purchasing a new structured finance product.

                                  SolarCity’s 10-K for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2014 describes the
                              assets backing these securities, as follows:

                                  In November 2013, we pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy sys-
                                  tems and the associated customer contracts into a special purpose entity, or
                                  SPE, and issued $54.4 million in aggregate principal of Solar Asset-backed
                                  Notes, Series 2013-1, backed by these solar assets to certain investors. The
                                  SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in our financial statements.
                                  Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the transfer of these
                                  solar assets. As of December 31, 2014, these solar assets had a carrying
                                  value of $143.9 million and are included under solar energy systems, leased
                                  and to be leased — net, in our consolidated balance sheets.
                                  Thus, collateral for these ABS was worth approximately 2.7 times the value
                              of the ABS themselves, calculated as follows:
                                  Total collateral USD143.9 million/Total value of ABS USD54.4 million

                                  = 2.66 times.

                               Solar ABS securities such as this one can offer an attractive risk/reward profile
                           for fixed-income investors. The securities are typically well-structured, with high
                           levels of collateralization and credit enhancement, relatively low risk of default, and
                           an attractive spread.


                           Credit Tranching
                           Subordination functions as credit protection for the more senior bond classes; that
                           is, losses are realized by the subordinated bond classes before any losses are realized
                           by the senior bond classes. This type of protection is also commonly referred to as a
                           “waterfall” structure because of the cascading flow of payments between bond classes
                           in the event of default, as shown in Exhibit 3.

                           Let’s revisit the BRWA securitization from an earlier module. In this case, CLT, the
                           SPE, acquired the pool of car loans from BRWA. Assume that CLT then issues four
                           bond classes with a total par value of EUR1,000 million: Bond Class A, the senior
                           tranche, with a par value of EUR825 million; Bond Class B, the mezzanine tranche,
                           with a par value of EUR100 million; Bond Class C, the junior tranche, with a par value

of EUR50 million; and Bond Class D, a junior tranche that is subordinated to all the
other bond classes and has a value of EUR25 million. In this structure, the four bond
classes determine the capital structure of the securitization transaction.
    In the securitization structure shown in Exhibit 4, there is a prioritization of pay-
ments that determines the timing of interest and principal cash flows to the different
tranches. The most senior investor tranche, with the highest ranking in the capital
structure, Class A, receives principal payments first, carries the lowest risk, and offers
the lowest return. The mezzanine tranche, Class B, assumes a slightly higher degree
of risk but offers higher returns. Class D absorbs losses first and has the highest risk,
with potentially the highest yield. The lowest tranche is sometimes referred to as the
“equity” tranche because of the residual nature of its claims to cash flows from the
asset pool.
    The four tranches carry different yields and degrees of risk, and they are impacted
differently in case of default. The specific terms and conditions are outlined in Exhibit
4. This structure is typical of securitizations.

                                   This senior/subordinated structure is an example of credit tranching. The most
                                   junior tranche, Class D, will absorb all losses up to EUR25 million. Should the credit
                                   losses exceed that threshold, Bond Class C will absorb all losses beyond the first
                                   EUR25 million, up to an additional EUR50 million. Consequently, Bond Class B will
                                   absorb losses beyond EUR75 million and up to an additional EUR100 million. Thus,
                                   if defaults in the CLT pool do not exceed EUR175 million, Bond Class A will be fully
                                   repaid its EUR825 million.
                                       For example, if the total loss on the collateral in CLT is EUR70 million, then Class
                                   D Notes absorb the first EUR25 million of losses and are wiped out, and the Class D
                                   investors lose their investment. Then Bond Class C absorbs an additional EUR45 mil-
                                   lion of losses, and the Class C investors are repaid only the remaining EUR5 million.
                                   However, both Bond Class A and B continue to receive payments from the pool as
                                   agreed: They do not realize any loss in this scenario. Clearly, Bond Class A realizes a
                                   loss only if the total loss on the collateral exceeds EUR175 million and all the more
                                   junior tranches are wiped out.
                                       This waterfall structure redistributes the credit risk associated with the collateral.
                                   The creation of a set of bond classes allows investors to choose the level of risk that
                                   they prefer to bear and receive a return accordingly. Moreover, by adjusting the features
                                   of the various tranches, investors can pick an appropriate combination of maturity,
                                   risk, and return characteristics.

                                           Risk ratings are assigned to each bond class created in the securitization, and
                                       these ratings depend on both the quality of the collateral and the seniority of
                                       the class. The risk ratings reflect the credit risk of the pool of securitized loans
                                       or receivables as well as the priority of how they absorb losses. In our example,
                                       the two subordinated classes would be considered risker than the senior class
                                       and would carry a much higher credit spread, with the Class D bonds carrying a
                                       higher spread than the Class C bonds. Depending on the structure of the secu-
                                       ritization, each bond class in the transaction receives a risk rating that reflects

    QUESTION SET


     1. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentences:

        It is common for securitizations to include a form of internal credit en-
        hancement called ______________, also referred to as ______________. In
        such a structure, there is more than one bond class, and the bond classes
        differ as to how they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the bor-
        rowers whose loans are in the collateral.
        Solution:
        It is common for securitizations to include a form of internal credit en-
        hancement called subordination, also referred to as credit tranching. In such
        a structure, there is more than one bond class, and the bond classes differ
        as to how they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the borrowers
        whose loans are in the collateral.

        The rules for the distribution of losses are as follows. All losses on the col-
        lateral are absorbed by Bond Class C before any losses are realized by Bond
        Class B and then Bond Class A. Consequently, if the losses on the collateral
        are SGD140 million, then the entire SGD60 million par value of Bond Class
        C is lost, as is the entire SGD60 million par value of Bond Class B. Bond
        Class A loses SGD20 million of its original SGD280 million par value.

                                 There are three main types of internal credit enhancements that are widely
                                 used in securitization transactions. _______________ is a provision that
                                 the collateral underlying the transaction is larger than the face value of
                                 the issued bonds, providing a cushion for continued payments even with
                                 defaults in the pool. Excess spread is the difference between the coupon on
                                 the underlying collateral and the coupon paid on the securities, which can
                                 absorb collateral shortfall or build up reserves. With _______________ or
                                 _______________, the securitization transaction involves creating more than
                                 one bond class or tranche, and the bond classes differ in how they share
                                 any losses resulting from defaults in the collateral pool. The ___________
                                 determines the order of payments made to investors and the order losses are
                                 absorbed by the investors.
                                 Solution:
                                 There are three main types of internal credit enhancements that are wide-
                                 ly used in securitization transactions. Overcollateralization is a provision
                                 that the collateral underlying the transaction is larger than the face value of
                                 the issued bonds, providing a cushion for continued payments even with
                                 defaults in the pool. Excess spread is the difference between the coupon
                                 on the underlying collateral and the coupon paid on the securities, which
                                 can absorb collateral shortfall or build up reserves. With subordination or
                                 credit tranching, the securitization transaction involves creating more than
                                 one bond class or tranche, and the bond classes differ in how they share any
                                 losses resulting from defaults in the collateral pool. The tranching deter-
                                 mines the order of payments made to investors, and the order losses are
                                 absorbed by the investors.

                              5. Which of the following statements about credit tranching is incorrect?
                                  A. The waterfall structure redistributes the credit risk associated with the
                                     underlying collateral.
                                  B. Some of the bond classes may have a better credit rating than the

      C. Risk ratings are based on the market risk of the pool of securitized
         loans or receivables as well as the priority of how they absorb losses.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is C. Risk ratings are based on the credit risk (not mar-
     ket risk) of the pool of securitized loans or receivables as well as the priority
     of how they absorb losses.
     A is incorrect because it is a correct statement. The waterfall structure re-
     distributes the credit risk associated with the collateral. The creation of a set
     of bond classes allows investors to choose the level of risk that they prefer
     to bear and receive return accordingly. B is incorrect because it is a correct
     statement. Each bond class in the transaction receives a risk rating that re-
     flects its credit risk, and some of the bond classes may exhibit a better credit
     rating than the company that is seeking to raise funds because of collateral-
     ization or credit enhancement.




NON-MORTGAGE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

              describe types and characteristics of non-mortgage asset-backed
              securities, including the cash flows and risks of each type

As we have seen earlier, non-mortgage assets, such as auto loans, have been used as
collateral in securitization. Securitizations can also involve credit card receivables,
personal loans, receivables, and commercial loans.
    ABS can be categorized whether the collateral is amortizing or non-amortizing.
Traditional residential mortgages and auto loans are examples of amortizing loans,
where the periodic payments include both principal and interest. In amortizing ABS,
as the loans are paid off, the investors receive the scheduled principal repayments,
and any prepayments will be distributed to the bond classes based on the payment
rule. Over time as loans mature, the number of loans and their total value shrinks.
    In contrast, non-amortizing loans, such as credit card debt, do not involve
scheduled principal repayments. For a non-amortizing collateral pool, the situation
is different. Over time, some of these loans will be repaid before the stated maturity
date of the ABS. If the loans are paid off during the lockout or revolving period, then
the principal repaid is reinvested to acquire additional loans with a principal equal
to the principal repaid. This reinvestment during the lockout period replenishes the
collateral pool. At the end of the lockout period, the amortization period starts, and
any principal that is repaid will not be reinvested in new loans but will be distributed
to the ABS holders.
    A large variety of assets can be securitized as non-mortgage ABS. This module
focuses on a credit card receivable ABS and a residential solar ABS.


Credit Card Receivable ABS
Credit cards, issued by banks, credit card companies, retailers, and travel and enter-
tainment companies, provide a convenient way to pay and extend credit. When a
purchase is made on a credit card, the issuer of the credit card (the lender) extends
credit to the cardholder (the borrower). The cardholder agrees to repay the amount

                           borrowed plus any applicable finance charges. From the lender’s perspective, the
                           borrowed amount is a receivable. These receivables can be pooled and used as the
                           underlying collateral for credit card receivable ABS.
                               A term sheet for a typical credit card ABS can be found in Exhibit 5. In this
                           particular securitization, Commercial Finance Partners AG (CFP), a European bank,
                           pools credit card receivables denominated in CHF. Credit card issuers, such as CFP,
                           benefit from credit card securitization. First, it removes the credit card receivables
                           from their balance sheet, which provides both capital efficiency and reduces the cost
                           of funding. Second, it reduces the cost of default risk from credit card debt. Third, it
                           generates additional fee income.
                               This particular ABS has a 3-year revolving period when the pool uses balance
                           repayments to purchase new credit card receivables, and this is followed by a 6-year
                           amortization period.

For a pool of credit card receivables, the cash flows consist of finance charges collected,
fees, and principal repayments. Finance charges collected are the periodic interest
rate the lender charges the borrower on the unpaid balance on the credit card. That
interest rate may be fixed or floating. Typically, the floating rate is capped: There is
an upper limit of how much the lender can charge the borrower. The fees the lender
collects from the borrower include late payment fees and any annual membership fees.
    As credit cards are non-amortizing loans, during the revolving period––in this
case the first 3 years of the structure––the security holders receive only payments
from the finance charges and fees the lender collects. The impact of the revolving
period and the amortization period on the cash flows that noteholders receive from
ABS that securitizes receivables are depicted in Exhibit 6.

Some provisions in credit card receivable ABS may require early principal amortiza-
tion if specific events occur. Such provisions are referred to as early amortization or
rapid amortization provisions and are included to safeguard the credit quality of the
issue, particularly during the revolving period. If the repayments during the revolving
periods are not sufficient to replenish the pool, or if the defaults significantly alter the
pool, the economics of the transaction may no longer be there. This triggers a rapid
amortization clause that accelerates and alters principal cash flows. Noteholders will
receive their investments earlier, which they can then reallocate to other investments
offering more attractive risk/return characteristics. These rapid amortization clauses
can be particularly beneficial to investors during periods when there are growing
uncertainties about the macroeconomic environment.
    Moreover, credit card ABS typically combine various sources of credit enhance-
ments to support the various tranches. ABS structures normally provide credit
enhancements through subordination. For instance, in the CFP example, there are four
tranches in addition to the overcollateralization (CHF25 million), the rapid amorti-
zation provision, and other tools to support investor appetite for an appropriate risk/

                           return trade-off. In this particular case, losses from the pool have to exceed CHF75
                           million, or 8.33% of the face value of the ABS issue, before holders of the Tranche C
                           Notes are impacted by the collateral losses.

                              For credit card receivable ABS, the collateral is a pool of non-amortizing loans.
                              During the lockout period, the cash proceeds from principal repayments are
                              reinvested in additional credit card receivables. During this period, there is no
                              prepayment risk and potential default risk is generally limited or is absorbed by
                              credit enhancements. When the lockout period is over, principal repayments
                              are used to pay off the outstanding principal on the ABS.
                                  For auto loan-backed securities, the collateral is a pool of amortizing loans
                              and occasionally leases. Security holders receive regular principal repayments.
                              As a result, the outstanding principal balance declines over time. Additionally,
                              the investors in the pool are exposed to both prepayment and default risk from
                              the inception of the pool.
                                  US credit card ABS ratings performed strongly through both the Global
                              Financial Crisis of 2008–09 (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic: Less than
                              2% of related ratings were downgraded during the GFC, and none were down-
                              graded during the pandemic’s onset in 2020. ABS performance is supported by
                              the consistent quality of securitized assets and structural features that protect
                              against weaker performance resulting from a stressed environment.

                           Solar ABS
                           With an increasing number of homeowners installing solar energy systems and other
                           home energy efficiency improvements, many specialty finance companies have begun
                           to offer specialized home improvement financing options: solar loans or solar leases.
                           Solar loans allow consumers to borrow the cost of purchasing and the system from an
                           installer. Solar leases involve renting the solar equipment directly from a solar company.
                               Switching to solar energy not only improves environmental sustainability, but it
                           also reduces overall household utility and electricity expenses. The economics are
                           straightforward: The utility cost savings from switching to solar energy are expected to
                           typically exceed the costs of investing in solar energy systems. Institutional investors
                           have become interested in purchasing solar ABS as these structures offer the oppor-
                           tunity to contribute to sustainability while generating attractive risk-adjusted yields.
                               Al-Shims Enterprises decides to securitize its solar energy systems loans via its
                           financing subsidiary using a solar ABS. The solar ABS issues EUR300 million notes
                           secured by 10,000 sustainable, residential, home improvement loans with a face value
                           of EUR320 million. The average loan balance of the home improvement loans is
                           EUR32,500, paying a weighted average rate of 7.5% with a weighted average maturity
                           of 17 years. All loans are amortizing. The net proceeds of the offering will be allocated,
                           in whole or in part, to the purchase and installation of residential solar energy systems,
                           which are eligible green projects.
                               From Al-Shims’ perspective, the securitization transaction removes receivables
                           from its balance sheet, increases capital efficiency, and generates fee income.

     An additional feature of the solar ABS transaction is that the proceeds are directed
to financing green or environmentally friendly projects. Because solar loans facilitate
environmentally sustainable benefits through the installation of a renewable and
efficient energy source, they may qualify as green bonds. For institutional investors
looking for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or climate finance investment
alternatives, solar ABS can offer an attractive investment alternative.
     The precise legal structure of the solar ABS transaction and its collateral depend
on the jurisdiction. Normally, ABS are collateralized by the underlying debt: mort-
gages, loans, or receivables. The loans can be further collateralized by a lien pledged
on the installed systems, on the property itself, or both. When the solar energy system
loans are structured as residential home improvement loans, the solar ABS effectively
securitizes a subordinated (junior) mortgage on the property.
     That is why solar ABS investors look for this type of debt: Usually, solar loan bor-
rowers are prime borrowers that own their homes and have good payment records.
Additionally, solar ABS investors are typically protected through overcollateralization,
subordination, and excess spreads. Collectively, these features further reduce the
default risk in these securitizations.
     Finally, many solar ABS contain a pre-funding period, which allows the trust to
acquire during a certain period of time after the close of the transaction additional
qualifying transactions that meet certain eligibility criteria.

EXAMPLE 5

   Potential Investment Strengths of Solar ABS
   Solar ABS can offer an attractive risk/reward profile for fixed income investors.
   The securities are typically well-structured, with high levels of collateraliza-
   tion and credit enhancement, relatively low risk of default, and an attractive
   spread. Solar ABS are collateralized by the underlying PV systems, with credit
   enhancement consisting of (i) overcollateralization, (ii) subordinate bonds, (iii)
   general reserve account, (iv) inverter replacement reserve account, and (v) excess
   spread. Additionally, to date, all solar ABS transactions through 2019 have been
   comprised of pools of consumers with weighted-average FICO consumer credit
   scores above 700.a
       Solar lease or loan payments often displace a consumer’s former energy
   payment thus losses in this sector will likely remain low. Defaulting on a solar
   loan is unlikely to reduce a consumer’s overall payment obligation as they need
   to purchase energy in some form, and defaulting on a solar loan could revert
   them to paying higher monthly energy expenses. While this asset class has not
   been through a full credit cycle (the first solar ABS was issued in November
   2013 by SolarCity), a combination of a higher credit quality consumer and the
   desire for a budget-saving power source may reduce the risk of default/loss on
   the underlying loan/lease payment.a
       With a focus on combatting climate change, consumers and utilities are
   continuing to shift away from traditional fossil fuels and are moving towards
   renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal. Unlike coal,
   petroleum, and other fossil fuels, solar power contributes to a more sustainable
   environment as a clean, carbon-free form of green energy. Solar ABS directly
   supports a sustainable future by offering solar energy providers a term funding
   source. Solar loan/lease payments primarily displace the homeowner’s former
   energy bill, with the average system generally sized to provide more than 90%
   of the home’s current usage.a

                                 ___________ of a credit card receivable ABS, the security holders receive
                                 only ________________________________.
                                  Solution:
                                  During the revolving period of a credit card receivable ABS, the security
                                  holders receive only payments from the finance charges and fees the lender
                                  collects.

                              2. Describe institutional investor motivations for investing in solar ABS.
                                  Solution:
                                  Institutional investors have become interested in purchasing solar ABS as
                                  these structures offer the opportunity to contribute to sustainability while
                                  generating attractive risk-adjusted yields. Solar loans have clear environ-
                                  mentally sustainable benefits through the installation of renewable energy
                                  and energy efficiency, which can make them appropriate for investors seek-
                                  ing ESG or climate finance investment alternatives.

                              3. Explain the potential investment advantage from including a pre-funding
                                 period into the structure of a solar ABS.
                                  Solution:
                                  A Solar ABS that includes a pre-funding period allows its underlying trust
                                  to acquire during a certain period of time after the close of the transaction
                                  additional qualifying transactions that meet certain eligibility criteria for
                                  sustainable investment. This enhances the overall environmental benefit.
                                  In addition, there is a direct investor benefit due to diversification benefits
                                  from a broader pool.

                              4. Describe a similarity of solar ABS and green covered bonds.

   5. Which of the following statements about credit card securitization is
      correct?
       A. Additional fee income is generated for the issuer.
       B. The credit card receivables are kept on the issuer’s balance sheet.
       C. The cost of default risk from credit card debt to the issuer increases.
      Solution:
      The correct answer is A. Credit card securitization generates additional
      fee income for the issuer. B is incorrect because the credit card receivables
      are removed from the issuer’s balance sheet, which provides both capital
      efficiency and reduces the cost of funding. C is incorrect because the cost of
      default risk from credit card debt is reduced.




COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS

              and risks

Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) issue securities backed by a diversified pool
of one or more debt obligations. CDOs can be backed by a broad range of debt. CDOs
backed by corporate and emerging market bonds are collateralized bond obligations
(CBOs); those backed by leveraged bank loans are collateralized loan obligations
(CLOs); those backed by other CDOs are structured finance CDOs; and those backed
by a portfolio of credit default swaps for other structured securities are synthetic
CDOs. The prevailing CDO structure is the CLO structure, where the collateral pool
is made up of leveraged bank loans.
    Exhibit 7 summarizes features of CDOs, covered bonds, mortgage-backed secu-
rities (MBS), and non-mortgage ABS:

                                 Similar to the ABS structures discussed earlier, the CDO structures redistribute the cash
                                 flows the underlying collateral pool generates and redistribute them to the tranches.
                                 For the majority of CDOs, the collateral pools are not static, so there is a need for
                                 a collateral manager that buys and sells debt obligations for and from the CDO’s
                                 collateral pool to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the obligations to the CDO
                                 bondholders. Otherwise, the steps and the structure of the securitization process are
                                 largely the same. The structure of a generic CDO transaction is shown in Exhibit 8.

                                 The proceeds to pay the CDO bond classes can come from interest payments from
                                 collateral assets, maturing of collateral assets, and sale of collateral assets. The basic
                                 economics of these CDO transactions is to ensure that the return on the collateral
                                 pool is higher than the funding costs, the aggregate cost of the bond classes issued to
                                 finance the transaction. Holders of senior and mezzanine bonds earn fixed returns,
                                 while the equity tranche holders and the CDO manager earn more equity-like returns.
                                 Essentially, a CDO is a leveraged transaction, where equity tranche holders use bor-
                                 rowed funds (the bond classes issued) to generate a return above the funding cost.
                                     The CDO market has changed significantly since the 2003–2007 period. The collat-
                                 eral today is primarily leveraged bank loans (i.e., CLOs), while during the 2003–2007
                                 period, it consisted of a wide range of products, including different types of real estate
                                 debt and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). While subsequent regu-
                                 latory and legal changes made arranging and investing in CDOs less attractive, the
                                 underlying securitization framework remains similar today. It can be best explored
                                 through CLOs, collateralized by senior secured bank loans creating a diversified
                                 portfolio of company loans.

Generic CLO Structure
The capital structure of a generic CLO transaction is shown in Exhibit 9. The funds
to purchase the collateral assets for a CLO are obtained from the issuance of debt
obligations. These tranches include senior, mezzanine, and subordinated/junior/
equity tranches.
    Investors in senior or mezzanine bond classes earn a potentially higher yield than
comparable corporate bonds offer, or they gain exposure to debt products that they
may not otherwise be able to acquire. Investors in equity tranches take on equity-like
risks with the potential to earn returns comparable to equities. Moreover, the residual
tranche plays a key role in whether a CLO is viable or not; the CLO structure has to
offer competitive returns for this tranche.
    CLOs come in multiple flavors. These are the most common:
   ■   Cash Flow CLOs, where the cash flows from interest payments and prin-
       cipal repayments are redistributed across the tranches. This is the most
       common CLO structure.
   ■   Market Value CLOs, where the value accruing to the tranches depends on
       the market value of the portfolio.
   ■   Synthetic CLOs, where the collateral pool is created synthetically through
       credit derivatives.

The ability of the manager to make the interest payments and principal repayments
depends on collateral performance. The collateral manager must continually meet
various performance tests and collateral limits for the underlying collateral. If the
manager fails pre-specified tests, a provision is triggered that requires the payoff of
the principal to the senior bond class until the tests are met. This process effectively
deleverages the CLO because the cheapest funding source for the CLO, the senior
bond class, is reduced.
    A typical feature of CLO transactions is that the collateral portfolio is not final-
ized until after the transaction closes. While the collateral manager acquires most of
the loans before the transaction closes, there is a subsequent ramp-up period when
additional assets are added to the collateral pool. After this period, the manager may
replace loans in the portfolio as long as the new asset meets the portfolio selection
criteria. The final phase of the CLO lifecycle is when the underlying loans mature
and the collateral manager uses the proceeds to pay off the tranches according to the
order of payments. Recourse is typically limited to the collateral pool, with minimal
recourse to the original issuers.

                               The cash flow waterfall, in connection with performance-based tests, provides
                           varying degrees of protection to the CLO’s debt tranches. The most senior and
                           highest-rated AAA tranche has the lowest yield but enjoys the highest claim on the
                           cash flow distributions and is the most loss-remote. Mezzanine tranches pay higher
                           coupons but are more exposed to loss and have lower ratings. The most junior tranche,
                           equity, is the riskiest, is not rated, and does not have a set coupon. Instead, the equity
                           tranche represents a claim on all excess cash flows once the obligations for each debt
                           tranche have been met.
                               CLOs face a series of coverage tests to help ensure the cash flows generated by
                           the underlying bank loan collateral meet the distribution obligations in the various
                           CLO tranches. One such test is an overcollateralization test, which helps to keep the
                           principal value of a CLO’s underlying bank loan pool from exceeding the total principal
                           value of the notes issued by the various CLO debt tranches as long as the CLO debt
                           remains outstanding. If the principal value declines below the overcollateralization test
                           trigger value, cash will be diverted away from equity and junior CLO debt tranches
                           toward senior debt tranche investors.
                               Consider a hypothetical CLO created with USD700 million of principal promised
                           to the owners of its various debt tranches. To meet this USD700 million obligation,
                           investors and rating agencies may require that the CLO manager use the capital raised
                           from the CLO’s debt and equity issuance to purchase USD840 million of bank loans.
                           This would result in an overcollateralization ratio of 1.20.
                               Each CLO debt tranche has its own targeted overcollateralization ratio. The over-
                           collateralization ratios for each tranche act as covenants and, when tripped, redirect
                           cash flows to purchase additional bank loan collateral or repay the senior-most CLO
                           debt tranche.
                               CLOs are also subject to a variety of other tests that act in concert in an effort to
                           help protect debt investors from loss. Examples of these tests include a measurement
                           of the industry diversification in the underlying collateral pool of bank loans and the
                           CLO’s exposure to non-senior secured loans. Other tests consider the diversity of
                           borrowers underlying each CLO and set single obligor limits. There are also limitations
                           on the amount of CCC-rated debt that can be included in the underlying collateral
                           pool, which help contain negative credit drift.
                               For CLO transactions, the role of the collateral manager is key. The skill the
                           manager displays in selecting, managing, and exchanging assets in the pool directly
                           impacts the performance of the CLO. In a way, the collateral manager acts as an active
                           bond portfolio manager by determining the asset mix and the risk and exposures in
                           the collateral pool.

                              CLOs and Systematic Risk
                              Institutional investors, such as banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, mutual
                              funds, and pension plans, are the primary buyers in the CLO market. Each of
                              these investors targets different CLO tranches. Due to regulations, many banks
                              almost exclusively buy the AAA-rated tranche. Other investors, such as hedge
                              funds and endowments, may be more speculative and thus take more risk to
                              earn higher returns. Current CLO structures are typically simpler than the CDO
                              structures that played a pivotal role in the GFC. Structured finance CDOs, which
                              are made up of other CDOs, are no longer common, and even synthetic CLOs
                              that use derivatives are less prevalent.
                                  After the GFC, the underlying asset quality of CLOs has received more scru-
                              tiny than was previously common. This is a reflection of the need to understand
                              the unique characteristics of the complex asset pool in a CLO.

QUESTION SET


  1. Describe how a CDO is distinguished from a CMO by the function
     of the CDO’s collateral manager.
     Solution:
     While CDOs are similar to CMOs in that both issue securities backed by
     a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations, CDO collateral pools
     usually are not static. Their volatility generates a need for a collateral man-
     agerthat buys and sells debt obligations for and from the CDO’s collateral
     pool to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the obligations to the CDO
     bondholders.

  2. Identify the CLO type that corresponds to its correct characteristic:

      i.     Relies on OTC contracts

      ii.    Most common CLO structure

      iii.   Sizes of tranches have greatest variability
                                             ​




    A. Cash flow CLO
    B. Market value CLO
    C. Synthetic CLO
                                             ​




     Solution:
                                             ​




    A. Cash flow CLO                        ii. Most common CLO structure
                                            iii. Sizes of tranches have greatest
    B. Market value CLO
                                            variability
    C. Synthetic CLO                        i. Relies on OTC contracts
                                             ​




      A. ii is correct. Cash flow CLOs are the most common CLO structure.
      B. iii. is correct. For market value CLOs, the value accruing to the
         tranches depends on the market value of the portfolio and thus cannot
         be stated with certainty.
      C. i is correct. The collateral pool of synthetic CLOs are created synthet-
         ically through credit derivatives, which are financial contracts traded
         OTC.

  3. Explain why a CDO’s equity tranche holders are most likely to earn the high-
     est returns when the CDO works as designed.
     Solution:
     The basic economics of CDO transactions is to ensure the return on the
     collateral pool is higher than the funding costs, the aggregate cost of the
     bond classes issued to finance the transaction. Holders of senior and mez-
     zanine tranches earn fixed returns, while the equity tranche holders and the
     CDO manager earn more equity-like returns. The equity tranche represents
     a claim on all excess cash flows once the obligations for each debt tranche
     have been met, so it is the riskiest tranche and should earn the highest
     return. Essentially, a CDO is a leveraged transaction, where equity tranche

                                 holders use borrowed funds (the bond classes issued) to generate a return
                                 above the funding cost.

                              4. Describe the effect of collateral performance test failure on a CLO’s financial
                                 structure.
                                 Solution:
                                 In making interest and principal payments, a CLO collateral manager must
                                 continually meet various performance tests and collateral limits for the
                                 underlying collateral. Upon a test failure, a provision is triggered requiring
                                 payoff of the principal to the senior bond class until the tests are met. This
                                 effectively deleverages the CLO because the cheapest funding source for the
                                 CLO, the senior bond class, is reduced.

                              5. In certain CLOs, the motivation is to capture a spread between the poten-
                                 tial collateral return and the funding cost. An additional risk of this type of
                                 securitization relative to an investment in an asset-backed security is:
                                  A. the default risk on the collateral assets.
                                  B. the risk that the CLO manager will fail to earn a return sufficient to
                                     pay off the investors in the senior and the mezzanine tranches.
                                  C. the risk due to the mismatch between the collateral making fixed-rate
                                     payments and the bond classes making floating-rate payments.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. In addition to the risks associated with investments in ABS,
                                 such as the default risk on the collateral assets (answer A) and the risk due
                                 to the potential mismatch between the collateral making fixed-rate pay-
                                 ments and the bond classes making floating-rate payments (answer C), in-
                                 vestors in CLOs face the risk that the CLO manager will fail to earn a return
                                 sufficient to pay off the investors in the senior and the mezzanine tranches.
                                 With an ABS, the cash flows from the collateral are used to pay off the
                                 holders of the bond classes without the active management of the collater-
                                 al—that is, without a manager altering the composition of the debt obliga-
                                 tions in the pool that is backing the securitization. In contrast, in a CLO, the
                                 manager buys and sells debt obligations with the dual purpose of not only
                                 paying off the holders of the bond classes but also generating an attractive/
                                 competitive return for the equity tranche and for the manager.

                              6. Which of the following statements about collateralized loan obligations
                                 (CLOs) is incorrect?
                                  A. Recourse is limited to the collateral pool, with minimal recourse to the
                                     original issuers.
                                  B. Investors in senior or mezzanine bond classes typically earn a lower
                                     yield than comparable corporate bonds.
                                  C. After the ramp-up period, the collateral manager may replace loans
                                     in the portfolio as long as the new asset meets the portfolio selection
                                     criteria.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. Investors in senior or mezzanine bond classes earn
                                 a potentially higher yield than comparable corporate bonds offer. A is incor-
                                 rect because it is a correct statement. Recourse is limited to the collateral
                                 pool, with minimal recourse to the original issuers. C is incorrect because

                           1. Which of the following statements regarding securitized products is correct?
                               A. Credit tranching offers credit protection for the equity tranche in a
                                  securitization.

                               B. Pass-through securities are the simplest securitized structure and involve
                                  issuers retaining the underlying assets.

                               C. In a true securitization, the underlying pool of assets is removed from the
                                  balance sheet and transferred into an independent legal entity that issues
                                  securities backed by these assets.

                           2. Upon a bankruptcy affecting a covered bond, the first available safeguards to
                              protect against potential losses are the:
                               A. ringfenced loans.

                               B. unencumbered assets of the issuer.

                               C. assets added by the collateral manager during ramp-up.

                           3. Consider the following potential reasons to explain why covered bonds usually
                              carry lower credit risks and offer lower yields than otherwise similar ABS:

                               Which of the following factors accurately explain(s) this result?
                               A. Reason 1 only

                               B. Reasons 1 and 2 only

                              SOLUTIONS
                           1. The correct answer is C. In a true securitization, the specific pool of assets is
                              removed from the balance sheet and transferred into a separate and independent
                              legal entity that then issues securities backed by these pooled assets. A is incor-
                              rect because credit tranching offers credit protection for the more senior bond
                              classes in a securitization not the equity tranche. B is incorrect because covered
                              bonds, not pass-through securities, are the simplest securitization structure,
                              which involves the issuer retaining the underlying assets on its balance sheet.

                           2. The correct answer is A. In the case of bankruptcy covered bond investors, they
                              have dual recourse with the first safeguard being the ringfenced loans in the cov-
                              er pool that underlie the covered bond transaction. B is incorrect because while
                              investors also have recourse to the unencumbered assets of the issuer, those serve
                              as a subsequent safeguard. C is incorrect because this post-transaction contri-
                              bution is characteristic of the non-amortizing structure of a CDO (collateralized
                              debt obligation).

                           3. The correct answer is C. All three of the listed reasons explain this comparative
                              result, which has made covered bonds a relatively stable and reliable source of
                              funding over time.

                           4. The correct answer is B. Overcollateralization, one of the three main types of
                              internal credit enhancements used in securitization transactions, is a provision
                              that the collateral underlying the transaction is larger than the face value of the
                              issued bonds. The extra collateral provides a cushion to cover losses from defaults
                              in the underlying pool of collateral. A and C are incorrect because both are types
                              of external, not internal, credit enhancements.

                           5. The correct answer is B. A credit card ABS generates additional fee income. A is
                              incorrect because by removing the credit card debt from the balance sheet, ABS
                              issuance improves capital efficiency and lowers the cost of funding. C is incorrect
                              as the ABS also reduces the cost of default risk from credit card debt.

                           6. The correct answer is C. Triggering rapid amortization provisions accelerates
                              and alters principal cash flows. Noteholders will receive their investments earlier,
                              which they can then reallocate to other investments offering more attractive
                              risk/return characteristics. A is incorrect because typically during the revolving
                              period, as credit cards are non-amortizing loans, the security holders receive only
                              payments from the finance charges and fees the lender collects. Returned princi-
                              pal is reinvested in the collateral pool. B is incorrect because when floating-rate
                              cap exceeds the rate cardholders must pay, there is no related binding limit on
                              finance payments.

                           7. The correct answer is B. Default risk minimization adds to investment appeal,
                              and solar loans provide opportunities for overcollateralization. Normally, solar
                              ABS are collateralized by the underlying debt: mortgages, loans, or receivables.
                              These loans can be further collateralized by a lien pledged on the installed sys-
                              tems, on the property itself, or both. A is incorrect as solar loans are typically
                              extended only to prime borrowers who own their homes and have good payment
                              records. C is incorrect as the loans enable property owner purchase of installed
                              systems instead of rental that is transacted through solar leases.

                           8. The correct answer is B. Investors in equity tranches take on equity-like risks
                              with the potential to earn returns comparable to equities. Moreover, these

Solutions                                                                                   491


   residual tranche investors play a key role in whether a CLO is viable or not; the
   CLO structure has to offer competitive returns for this tranche. Facing these
   risk/return possibilities puts them in the position of the marginal, price-setting
   investors. A and C are incorrect because they are promised fixed returns without
   reference to the underlying performance of the collateral pool. They are also
   exposed to less risk in having seniority payoff preference in case of default.

9. The correct answer is C. After the ramp-up period but before underlying collater-
   al pool loans mature, the collateral manager may replace loans in the portfolio as
   long as the new asset meets the portfolio selection criteria. A is incorrect be-
   cause while additional assets are added to the collateral pool during a subsequent
   ramp-up period, loan replacements can still occur after the ramp-up period. B
   is incorrect because a typical feature of CLO transactions is that the collateral
   portfolio is not finalized until after the transaction closes.

10. The correct answer is B. A complicating factor of a default can be the call features
    embedded in bonds. While exercising call options on debt would replenish the
    collateral pool, distributing these proceeds to the senior and mezzanine tranch-
    es would shrink the size of the collateral pool, further narrowing the earnings
    potential with junior tranches receiving the least cash flow. A is incorrect because
    senior tranches are then in danger of not receiving some or any payments,
    depending on the size of the default. C is incorrect because losses would first be
    absorbed by junior tranche investors, with remaining losses realized by the other
    tranches in order of repayment seniority.

11. The correct answer is C. As illustrated by their respective term sheets, all three
    types of ABS transactions have timing milestones designating due dates for
    investments (settlement date) and the end of their terms (maturity date). A is
    incorrect because in contrast to their non-amortizing counterparts, covered
    bonds are backed by a segregated pool of assets that typically consist of commer-
    cial or residential mortgages, for which an LTV cutoff is applicable. B is incorrect
    because while other ABS often use credit tranching to create bond classes with
    different borrower default exposures, covered bonds usually consist of one bond
    class per cover pool.

12. The correct answer is C. A CDO is a leveraged transaction, where equity tranche
    holders use borrowed funds (i.e., the bond classes issued) to generate a return
    above the funding cost. A is incorrect because unlike MBS, the pools in a CDO
    are not static; so, there is a need for a collateral manager that buys and sells debt
    obligations for and from the CDO’s collateral pool to generate sufficient cash
    flows to meet the obligations to the CDO bondholders. B is incorrect because the
    proceeds to pay the CDO bond classes can come from interest payments from
    collateral assets, maturing of collateral assets, and sale of collateral assets.

and typical securitization structures. This module focuses on the largest ABS market
in the world, mortgage-backed securities (MBS). It introduces mortgage loans and
their characteristic features; discusses residential MBS (RMBS), including mort-
gage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs); and
describes commercial MBS (CMBS). It shows how to measure, mitigate, and share
securitization-related risks across different tranches and their characteristics, and it
examines MBS cash flows and risks.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Prepayment risk is the risk that the borrower does not repay
          the principal (or a portion of the principal) as scheduled.
          Contraction risk occurs when the borrower repays the principal faster
          than anticipated, while extension risk occurs when the borrower
          repays the principal more slowly than planned.

                                  ■   Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are bonds created from securi-
                                      tizing mortgage loans. Mortgage loans provide borrowers the funds
                                      to purchase property and require borrowers to repay lenders on a
                                      mutually agreed schedule, otherwise the lender has the right to seize
                                      the property.
                                  ■   MBS can be created based on either residential or commercial mort-
                                      gages. Bonds created from the securitization of mortgages backed
                                      by residential properties are residential mortgage-backed securities
                                      (RMBS).
                                  ■   Because both scheduled principal repayments and unscheduled pre-
                                      payments are made over the life of an MBS, the contractual maturity
                                      for an MBS does not reveal its actual payments and prepayments. The
                                      weighted average life is a measure widely used to assess when an MBS
                                      can be expected to be paid off.
                                  ■   A mortgage pass-through security is a security created when mort-
                                      gage lenders pool mortgages together and use them to back securities
                                      that they sell to investors. The cash flows of a mortgage pass-through
                                      security depend on the monthly cash flows of the underlying pool of
                                      mortgages.
                                  ■   Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) securitize mortgage
                                      pass-through securities or multiple pools of loans and are structured
                                      to redistribute the cash flows to different bond classes or tranches,
                                      thereby creating securities that have different exposures to prepay-
                                      ment risk.
                                  ■   The tranching structure of a CMO can redistribute prepayment risk
                                      across the different tranches; the more senior a tranche is, the less
                                      exposure it has to prepayment risk and default risk.
                                  ■   Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) can consist of just a
                                      few underlying commercial mortgages, and so one default in a CMBS
                                      pool may significantly impact the CMBS investors. Investors must
                                      evaluate this unique concentration risk by analyzing the individual
                                      loans and properties backing the CMBS, the owners of the commercial
                                      properties themselves, as well as the CMBS structure.
                                  ■   Unlike RMBS, CMBS offer investors call protection at either the struc-
                                      tural or individual loan level and thus trade more like corporate bonds
                                      than RMBS. However, commercial mortgages often include a large
                                      balloon payment at maturity, making CMBS more vulnerable to a type
                                      of extension risk, balloon risk.

                              1. Which of the following statements regarding the loan-to-value ratio
                                 (LTV) is most accurate?
                                  A. The LTV for a given mortgage remains static for the life of the loan.
                                  B. The higher the LTV, the more protection a lender has in the event of
                                     default.

Introduction                                                                          495


      C. LTV serves as a key measure in both residential and commercial
         mortgages.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is C. LTV serves as a key measure both in residential
     and commercial mortgages. LTV is calculated as the ratio of the amount of
     the mortgage to the property’s value. A is incorrect because over time, the
     LTV changes: As the borrower makes mortgage payments, including prin-
     cipal repayments, the outstanding balance on the loan is reduced and also,
     fluctuations in the market value of the property cause the borrower’s equity
     to change. B is incorrect because the higher the LTV, the less protection a
     lender has in the event of default.

  2. Which of the following statements regarding mortgage-backed securities
     (MBS) is most accurate? MBS:
      A. must be backed or guaranteed by a government or a quasi-government
         entity.
      B. can be created by securitizing mortgages backed by residential or by
         commercial properties.
      C. that use credit enhancements to reduce credit risk for securities
         backed by residential mortgages typically are agency RMBS.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. The mortgages in MBS can either be residential
     mortgages or commercial mortgages. A is incorrect because MBS do not
     have to be guaranteed by the government or a quasi-government entity. But,
     when these mortgages or the securities issued backed by these mortgages
     are guaranteed by the government, there is a credit support. MBS backed by
     residential mortgages that are issued by private entities and not guaranteed
     by a federal agency or a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) are called
     “non-agency RMBS.” C is incorrect because non-agency RMBS, not agen-
     cy RMBS, typically use credit enhancements, such as insurance, letters of
     credit, guarantees, or subordinated interests, to mitigate the credit risk and
     improve the overall quality of the mortgage pool. These securities include
     credit enhancements because they are not guaranteed or insured by a gov-
     ernment agency or by a GSE.

  3. When a mortgage is used as collateral for a mortgage pass-through security,
     the mortgage is most likely said to be:
      A. enhanced.
      B. securitized.
      C. subordinated.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. When a mortgage is used as collateral for a
     mortgage pass-through security, the mortgage is said to be securitized.
     A and C are incorrect because a mortgage that is used as collateral for a
     mortgage pass-through security is said to be securitized, not enhanced or
     subordinated.

  4. Which of the following structures is created through time tranching?
      A. Z-tranches
      B. Floating-rate tranches

                                  C. Principal-only (PO) securities
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is A. Z-tranches and residual tranches are created
                                 through time tranching, which means they do not pay interest payments
                                 until a pre-set date. B is incorrect because floating-rate tranches carry
                                 interest rates that are linked to an index or a market reference rate (MRR)
                                 and are used to hedge interest rate risk in portfolios. C is incorrect because
                                 principal-only (PO) securities pay only the principal repayments from the
                                 pool and can be created either from mortgage pass-throughs or as a tranche
                                 in a CMO.

                              5. Which of the following risks most likely explains why the maturity of an
                                 MBS declines when interest rates decline?
                                  A. Balloon risk
                                  B. Extension risk
                                  C. Contraction risk
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. Contraction risk is the risk that the borrower might
                                 pay back the money borrowed more quickly than anticipated, reducing the
                                 amount of future payments the investor receives. When interest rates de-
                                 cline, actual prepayments will be higher than forecasted because homeown-
                                 ers will be more likely to refinance their mortgages. A is incorrect because
                                 balloon risk occurs when the borrower fails to make the balloon payment at
                                 the maturity of a loan with a balloon payment; it is a form of extension risk.
                                 B is incorrect because extension risk is the risk that the borrower might pay
                                 back the money borrowed more slowly than anticipated, extending rather
                                 than shortening the time of repayment and the maturity of the bond.

                              6. Which of the following statements related to mortgage-backed securities
                                 (MBS) is true?
                                  A. The contractual maturity for an MBS accurately predicts future pay-
                                     ments and prepayments.
                                  B. A measure widely used by market participants for MBS is the weighted
                                     average life, or simply the average life, of the MBS.
                                  C. A 30-year, option-free corporate bond and an MBS with a 30-year
                                     legal maturity with the same coupon rate offer equivalent interest rate
                                     risk.
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. A measure widely used by market participants for
                                 MBS is the weighted average life, or simply the average life, of the MBS.
                                 This measure gives investors an indication of how long they can expect to
                                 hold the MBS before it is paid off, assuming interest rates stay at current
                                 levels and thus expected prepayments are realized. A is incorrect because
                                 the contractual maturity for an MBS does not reveal its actual payments and

                                 ty of an MBS, but the pattern of repayments is driven by shifts in interest

                                 rate and thus would not offer equivalent interest rate risk.

Introduction                                                                            497


  7. A major difference between residential and commercial mortgage-backed
     securities is that:
      A. CMBS securitize conforming mortgages and are collateralized by
         homogeneous properties as compared to properties backing an RMBS.
      B. investors must evaluate the individual loans and properties backing a
         CMBS as well as the owners of the commercial properties themselves.
      C. a CMBS pool may consist of thousands of mortgages from various
         parts of a country, while an RMBS may consist of a few homogenous
         residential mortgages.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. CMBS can consist of a few underlying commercial
     mortgages, whereas an RMBS pool may consist of thousands of mortgages
     from various parts of a country. Thus, one default in a CMBS pool may have
     a significant impact on the CMBS investors. Investors in the CMBS must
     consider explicitly this unique concentration risk by not only analyzing the
     CMBS structure but also the individual loans and properties backing the
     CMBS as well as the owners of the commercial properties themselves. A is
     incorrect because RMBS, not CMBS, securitize conforming mortgages and
     are collateralized by homogeneous (single-family) residential properties. C
     is incorrect because an RMBS pool, not a CMBS pool, may consist of thou-
     sands of mortgages from various parts of a country, while CMBS can consist
     of a few underlying commercial mortgages.

  8. Which of the following statements related to the debt service coverage
     (DSC) ratio, a key indicator of potential credit performance in commercial
     real estate lending, is most accurate? A DSC ratio:
      A. is equal to the property’s annual net operating income (NOI) divided
         by its debt service.
      B. is calculated as the ratio of the amount of the loan to the underlying
         property’s value.
      C. that exceeds 1.0 indicates that the cash flows from the property are
         insufficient to cover the debt service while maintaining the property in
         its initial state of repair.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is A. The DSC ratio is equal to the property’s annual
     NOI divided by its debt service. NOI is defined as the rental income re-
     duced by cash operating expenses and a replacement reserve. Debt service
     is the annual amount of interest payments and principal repayments. B
     is incorrect because the ratio of the amount of the loan to the underlying
     property’s value is the LTV ratio, another key indicator of potential credit
     performance, not the DSC. C is incorrect because a DSC ratio that exceeds
     1.0 indicates that the cash flows from the property are sufficient, not insuf-
     ficient, to cover the debt service while maintaining the property in its initial
     state of repair.

              2            TIME TRANCHING

                                         define prepayment risk and describe time tranching structures in
                                         securitizations and their purpose

                           ABS and MBS pass-through security cash flows are uncertain because scheduled and
                           actual payments frequently differ. Borrower behavior, such as the early payment of
                           interest and principal as well as payment delinquencies over the life of a loan, depends
                           upon a number of factors, including the income of the borrower (household income
                           or cash flows for a corporation), the terms and conditions of the loan (such as the
                           original interest rate versus current rates and any prepayment penalties), and the sale
                           of the underlying asset being financed. To correctly value these securities, investors
                           make certain assumptions about the predicted contractual payments after factoring
                           in prepayment risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that the principal or a proportion of
                           the principal is paid back at a different pace from the contractually agreed scheduled
                           payment plan by the borrower. Prepayment risk has two components: contraction risk
                           and extension risk, both of which reflect changes in the general level of interest rates.


                           Prepayment Risk
                           When interest rates decline, actual prepayments for fixed-rate mortgages will be higher
                           than forecasted because homeowners will refinance at lower interest rates. Mortgage
                           refinancing is particularly common in the US given the absence of loan prepayment
                           penalties, which are more prevalent in other countries. Thus, the maturity of an MBS
                           will be shorter than what was anticipated at the time of purchase. Contraction risk
                           is the risk that the borrower repays the principal or a portion of the principal in a
                           shorter period of time than the contractually agreed scheduled payment, reducing the
                           amount of future payments the investor receives. For investors, this has two adverse
                           consequences. First, investors must reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates.
                           Second, the prepayment option reduces the potential price appreciation for the bond.
                               When interest rates increase, actual prepayments will be lower than forecasted
                           because homeowners will become less likely to refinance their mortgages and may even
                           delay new home purchases. Thus, the maturity of an MBS will be longer than what
                           was anticipated at the time of purchase. Extension risk is the risk that the borrower
                           repays the principal or a proportion of the principal in a longer time period than the
                           contractually agreed scheduled payment. For investors, this has adverse consequences:
                           Higher interest rates reduce the value of the cash flows investors receive. Therefore,
                           payments the investors receive will be discounted at a higher interest rate, and the
                           extension stretches out the payments the investors receive.
                               The structure of a securitization may also allow the redistribution of “prepayment
                           risk” among bond classes. An approach for reducing this risk is to create bond classes
                           that possess different expected maturities. This is referred to as time tranching. For
                           instance, a securitization pool may contain sequential tranching, where the principal
                           repayments flow first to one tranche until the principal is fully repaid for that tranche
                           and then to the sequential tranche until the principal is repaid for that tranche.

  investors also could select bonds based on their expected maturity. However, the
  investors could face prepayment or extension risk in this instance. The specific

                              Volkswagen Emissions Scandal
                              Investors are exposed to certain types of idiosyncratic risks when buying asset-
                              backed securities (ABS). For buyers of auto ABS, major automaker recalls
                              are a known risk to bond investors. In 2015, the US Securities and Exchange
                              Commission (SEC) accused Volkswagen (VW), one of the world’s largest carmak-
                              ers, and its CEO Martin Winterkorn with defrauding American investors during
                              an emissions scandal (the “Dieselgate” scandal). Volkswagen later admitted that
                              it cheated on diesel emission tests, and this admission wiped billions of euros
                              from the company’s market value and led to the resignation of Winterkorn.
                              The emissions scandal that rocked Volkswagen also impacted ABS tied to car
                              loans and leases. Sales of auto ABS were booming in the years just prior to the
                              scandal as investors sought higher-yielding products given the low interest-rate
                              environment.
                                  About USD5.6 billion worth of VW auto ABS were outstanding in 2015, with
                              USD4.39 billion coming from bonds backed by loans and leases. Volkswagen,
                              facing potential fines and litigation, found its ability to attract new business tem-
                              porarily crimped, forcing down the values of the cars backing such loans. There
                              were USD1.25 billion worth of bonds that were backed by car dealer inventories
                              of VW cars, known as dealer floorplan ABS. For dealer floorplan ABS, the ABS
                              trust benefits from VW financing assistance, including but not limited to VW’s
                              pledge to repurchase unsold new vehicles and inventory. Car dealers, told to
                              immediately halt sales of popular 2015 and 2016 models, including Volkswagen's
                              Jetta and Beetle convertible, were saddled with unsalable product. Dealers had a
                              number of cars that they could not sell, so inventory did not turn over as rapidly.
                              The ABS most adversely affected by VW’s sales stoppage of certain 2015 and
                              2016 diesel models was the dealer floorplan securitization.
                                  Debt investors were demanding greater compensation from Volkswagen after
                              the company said its emissions-cheating scandal would cost the firm more than
                              EUR6.5 billion. Volkswagen, a frequent issuer in Europe’s asset-backed securities
                              market, said that EUR2.6 billion of loans or leases for vehicles built with engines
                              using cheating software were packaged into its securitizations.
                                  Late in 2015, Volkswagen was marketing a new auto ABS with a yield premium
                              that was three times bigger than a similar deal earlier that year. The German
                              carmaker was offering to pay about 60 bps to 65 bps more than benchmark
                              rates for top-ranking notes of the securitization of auto leases. In comparison,
                              Volkswagen paid a spread of 20 bps over the one-month euro interbank offered
                              rate for similar debt in April 2015.

QUESTION SET


  1. Creating bond classes that possess different expected maturities is
     referred to as:
      A. subordination.
      B. time tranching.
      C. credit tranching.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. An approach for reducing “prepayment risk” or
     “extension risk” among bond classes is to create bond classes that possess
     different expected maturities. This is referred to as time tranching. A and
     C are incorrect because subordination, also commonly referred to as a
     “waterfall” structure, involves directing losses to the subordinated bond
     classes before the senior bond classes, not creating bond classes that possess
     different expected maturities.

  2. Identify which of the following statements regarding securitized products is
     most accurate:
      A. With time tranching, the tranches of a CMO amortize over time and
         all tranches mature at the same time.
      B. Pass-through securities are the simplest securitized structure and
         involve issuers retaining the underlying assets.
      C. In a true securitization, the underlying pool of assets is removed from
         the balance sheet and transferred into an independent legal entity that
         issues securities backed by these assets.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is C. In a true securitization, the specific pool of as-
     sets is removed from the balance sheet and transferred into a separate and
     independent legal entity that then issues securities backed by these pooled
     assets. A is incorrect because time tranching is an approach to reduce
     prepayment or extension risk by creating bond classes that possess different
     expected maturities. B is incorrect because covered bonds, not pass-through
     securities, are the simplest securitization structure; they involve the issuer
     retaining the underlying assets on its balance sheet.

  3. Issuing the collateralized bond classes with different expected maturities is
     most likely designed to mitigate:
      A. credit risk.
      B. default risk.
      C. prepayment risk.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is C. Prepayment risk is the uncertainty that the cash
     flows will be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth in the lease
     agreement because of the lessors’ ability to alter payments. The creation of
     bond classes with different expected maturities, referred to as time tranch-
     ing, allows prepayment risk to be redistributed among bond classes. A is
     incorrect because credit risk pertains to the risk of default in the assets
     backing the collateralized bonds, not to the timing of payments, and B is in-

                           This lesson describes fundamental features of mortgage loans, the building block of
                           the largest ABS market, the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market. MBS are
                           bonds created from the securitization of mortgages. A mortgage loan is secured by
                           the collateral of a specified real estate property that obliges the borrower to make a
                           predetermined series of payments to the lender. The mortgage lender has a first lien
                           and security interest in the property, which gives the lender the right to seize the col-
                           lateral if the borrower does not pay as agreed. Upon a default on the mortgage loan,
                           the lender can potentially foreclose on the property. The foreclosure would allow the
                           lender to take possession of the property and ultimately sell the property to recover
                           funds toward satisfying the outstanding debt obligation.
                               Typically, the amount of the loan advanced to buy the property is less than the
                           property’s purchase price: The difference is the down payment. The ratio of the amount
                           of the mortgage to the property’s value is called the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The
                           lower the LTV, the higher the borrower’s equity. From the lender’s perspective, the
                           higher the borrower’s equity, the less likely the borrower is to default. Moreover, the
                           lower the LTV, the more protection the lender has if the borrower does default and
                           the lender repossesses and sells the property. When the loan is first taken out, the
                           borrower’s equity in the property is equal to the down payment. Over time, the LTV
                           changes: As the borrower makes mortgage payments, including principal repayments,
                           the outstanding balance on the loan is reduced and as the market value of the property
                           changes, the borrower’s equity also changes. LTV serves as a key measure both in
                           residential and commercial mortgages.
                               The capacity to sustain debt payments is another consideration. For residential
                           lending, the metric is the debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which compares an individual’s
                           monthly debt payments to their monthly pre-tax, gross income. Lenders, including

mortgage lenders, use the DTI to measure an individual’s ability to manage monthly
payments and repay debts. A low DTI shows a balance between income and debt
and suggests that the borrower could sustain additional debt. A high DTI ratio sig-
nals that the borrower may carry too much debt for the amount of income earned
each month. Typically, lenders want to see low DTI ratios before extending loans to
a potential borrower.

EXAMPLE 3

  LTV and DTI Calculation
  A borrower wishes to secure a mortgage loan to purchase a house. Information
  regarding the house, the desired loan, and the buyer’s finances is shown below:
        ■   House Price: EUR800,000
        ■   Desired Loan Amount: EUR600,000
        ■   Annual interest rate: 4.50%
        ■   Loan term: 20 years/240 months
        ■   Borrower’s annual pre-tax gross income EUR141,000
     The associated loan-to-value ratio (LTV) can be calculated using the desired
  loan value and the anticipated house price, as shown here:

        	​LTV = _
                Loan Amount
                ​House Price ​

                EUR 600, 000
        	​LTV = _
                ​EUR 800, 000 ​ = 75%​.

    To calculate the debt-to-income ratio (DTI), we use the monthly debt pay-
  ment and the borrower’s monthly pre-tax gross income:

     We calculate the monthly debt payment, with the first five and final five
  monthly payments of the 20-year mortgage. Putting the borrower’s monthly

                               In the United States, market participants typically identify two types of mortgages
                           based on the credit quality of the borrower: prime loans and subprime loans. Prime
                           loans have borrowers of high credit quality with strong employment and credit his-
                           tories, a low DTI, substantial equity in the underlying property, and a first lien on
                           the mortgaged property serving as the collateral for the loan. Subprime loans have
                           borrowers with lower credit quality, high DTI, and/or are loans with higher LTV, and
                           include loans that are secured by second liens otherwise subordinated to other loans.


                           Agency and Non-Agency RMBS
                           The mortgages in MBS can either be residential mortgages or commercial mortgages.
                           The bonds created from the securitization of mortgages backed by residential prop-
                           erties are residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).
                               In the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea, there is a distinction between
                           RMBS that are guaranteed by the government or a quasi-government entity and
                           RMBS that are not. In the United States, securities backed by residential mortgages
                           are divided into three sectors:
                               1. Guaranteed by a federal agency;
                               2. Guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs); and
                               3. Issued by private entities and thus not guaranteed by a federal agency or a
                                  GSE.
                                The first two sectors are referred to as agency RMBS, and the third sector is
                           referred to as non-agency RMBS. Agency RMBS include securities issued by gov-
                           ernment agencies. These RMBS carry the full faith and credit of the government,
                           essentially a guarantee with respect to timely payment of interest and repayment of
                           principal. Agency RMBS also include RMBS issued by GSEs. RMBS issued by GSEs do
                           not carry the full faith and credit of the government, but rather the GSEs’ guarantee
                           of the timely payment of interest and principal for the securities. The GSE’s charge a
                           fee for this guarantee.
                                Due to changing regulatory guidance and increased scrutiny, non-agency-RMBS
                           all but disappeared after the global financial crisis. They were issued by banks, finan-
                           cial institutions, and other private businesses and were not beneficiaries of govern-
                           ment guarantees. These private pass-throughs or private label MBS gained credit
                           enhancement through pool insurance, letters of credit, guarantees, or subordination.
                           Non-agency RMBS securitized mortgages were collateralized by non-conforming
                           mortgages, or by subprime, highly risky mortgages. Some residential home improve-
                           ment loans, such as solar ABS discussed in an earlier lesson, that are subordinated to
                           primary mortgage liens are now securitized in increasing volume.


                           Mortgage Contingency Features
                           Mortgages contain certain features that give the borrower and the lender certain rights
                           throughout the contract. The most important right a borrower has is the option to
                           prepay a mortgage by making any payment on the principal that exceeds the sched-
                           uled principal repayment. The prepayment option or an early repayment option
                           may entitle the borrower to prepay all or part of the outstanding mortgage principal
                           prior to maturity. This creates a risk from the lender’s or investor’s viewpoint: the
                           cash flow amounts and timing cannot be known with certainty. This prepayment risk
                           affects all mortgages that allow prepayment, not only the level-payment, fixed-rate,
                           fully amortizing mortgages.

    Lenders reduce this risk by stipulating a monetary penalty for prepayment that
compensates the lender for the difference between the contract rate and the prevailing
mortgage rate if the borrower prepays when interest rates decline. It is an effective
mechanism that provides some certainty for the lender and reduces the incentive to
prepay a mortgage. Prepayment penalty mortgages are quite common in Europe, while
in the United States few mortgages have prepayment penalties.
    When the borrower fails to make the contractual loan payments as stipulated in
the note and loan documents, it may trigger a default on the mortgage loan that would
allow the lender to potentially foreclose on the property and sell it. But the proceeds
received from the sale of the property may be insufficient to recoup the losses. In a
recourse loan, the lender has a claim against the borrower for the shortfall (deficiency)
between the amount of the outstanding mortgage balance and the proceeds received
from the sale of the property. In a non-recourse loan, the lender does not have such
a claim against the borrower and thus can look only to the property to recover the
outstanding mortgage balance. In the United States, recourse is typically determined
by the state, and residential mortgages are non-recourse loans in many states. In
contrast, residential mortgages in most European countries are recourse loans.
    The recourse/non-recourse feature of a mortgage has implications for projecting
the likelihood of defaults by borrowers, particularly for mortgages where the LTV
exceeds 100%—sometimes referred to as “underwater mortgages.”

EXAMPLE 4

   Underwater Mortgages during the 2008–09 Global
   Financial Crisis
   A mortgage is said to be in negative equity, or “underwater,” when a home is val-
   ued for less than the amount their owners owe the banks holding their mortgage
   loans. Being underwater is typically a precursor to foreclosure.
       The most extreme example of widespread underwater mortgages occurred
   during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–09 (GFC). At the end of 2009, almost
   10.7 million, or 23% of, US residential properties were underwater. An additional
   2.3 million mortgages were approaching negative equity, meaning they had less
   than 5% equity.
       This phenomenon existed primarily because of loose credit underwriting
   standards and inflated home prices from 2004–06, followed by declining home
   prices and high leverage on non-recourse mortgage loans provided by banks
   and other debt capital providers.
       The distribution of negative equity was heavily concentrated in five states:
   Nevada (65%), followed by Arizona (48%), Florida (45%), Michigan (37%), and
   California (35%). Among the top five states, the average negative equity share
   was 40%, compared to 14% for the remaining states.
       The rise in negative equity is closely tied to increases in pre-foreclosure
   activity. At one end of the spectrum, borrowers with equity tend to have very
   low default rates. At the other end, investors tend to more commonly default on
   their mortgages once in negative equity, as their default rate is typically 2% to 3%
   higher than owner-occupied homes with similar degrees of negative equity. For
   the highest level of negative equity, investors and owners behave very similarly
   and default at similar rates. Strategic default on the part of the owner occupier
   becomes more likely at such high levels of negative equity, especially when the
   mortgage loan is non-recourse.

                                If the mortgage is non-recourse, the borrower may have an incentive to strate-
                           gically default on an underwater mortgage and allow the lender to foreclose on the
                           property, even if the borrower has resources available to continue to make mortgage
                           payments. Although there are negative consequences to a “strategic default,” such as
                           lower credit scores and a reduced ability to borrow in the future, some borrowers may
                           make use of this approach. Where mortgages are recourse loans, a strategic default
                           is less likely because the lender can recover the shortfall from the borrower’s other

                              1. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentences:

                                 ___________ are bonds created from the securitization of mortgages. A
                                 ____________ is secured by the collateral of some specified real estate prop-
                                 erty that obliges the borrower to make a predetermined series of payments
                                 to the lender.
                                 Solution:
                                 MBS are bonds created from the securitization of mortgages. A mortgage
                                 loan is secured by the collateral of some specified real estate property that
                                 obliges the borrower to make a predetermined series of payments to the
                                 lender.

                              2. A borrower procures a JPY33,165,000 loan for a JPY36,850,000 house in To-
                                 kyo. Calculate the LTV for this transaction and explain why the lender uses
                                 this measure.
                                 Solution:
                                 The LTV (loan-to-value ratio) is the ratio of the amount of the mortgage to
                                 the property’s value.
                                            Amount of the mortgage
                                           __________________
                                  	​ LTV =   
                                           ​   
                                              Property's value ​

                                           33, 165, 000
                                  	​LTV = _
                                          ​36, 850, 000 ​

                                  	​LTV = 90.0%​.
                                 The lender uses the LTV ratio to assess the likelihood that a borrower will
                                 default. The lower the LTV, the higher a borrower’s equity. The higher the
                                 borrower’s equity, the less likely a default.

                              3. Identify the mortgage feature below that corresponds to its description.
                                 (Matching)

                                                                           borrower fails to make required loan
                                                                           payments

     Solution:

      1. D is correct. Maturity is the typical term or number of years to matu-
         rity of a mortgage.
      2. A is correct. The interest rate on a mortgage is called the mortgage
         rate, contract rate, or note rate, and it varies among countries.
      3. E is correct. Amortization pertains to the pace at which the balance of
         a loan is gradually reduced over time according to a set schedule.
      4. B is correct. A prepayment option (or early repayment option) may
         entitle the borrower to prepay all or part of a mortgage’s outstanding
         principal prior to maturity.
      5. C is correct. When a borrower fails to make the contractual loan pay-
         ments, the lender’s rights in a foreclosure allow foreclosure and sale of
         the property.

  4. A real estate investor has obtained a recourse mortgage loan on a shopping
     center from a bank. The loan has an outstanding balance of USD7,000,000,
     while the property is valued at only USD5,000,000. In the event of a default
     on the loan, the bank has a claim on:
      A. the property.
      B. the borrower’s personal assets.
      C. both the property and the borrower’s personal assets.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is C. In a recourse loan, the lender has a claim against
     the borrower for the shortfall (deficiency) between the amount of the out-
     standing mortgage balance and the proceeds received from the sale of the
     property. A is incorrect because in a non-recourse loan, the lender has a
     claim against only the property for any shortfall between the amount of the
     outstanding mortgage balance and the proceeds received from the sale of
     the property. B is incorrect because mortgage lending entails a first lien and
     security interest in the property, which is the lender’s collateral.

508   Learning Module 19                          Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS) Instrument and Market Features


                              A mortgage pass-through security is a security created when mortgage lenders
                           pool mortgages together and sell securities to investors. The cash flow from the mort-
                           gage pool––monthly payments of principal, interest, and prepayments––are “passed
                           through” to the security holders. A pool can consist of several thousand or only a
                           few mortgages. When a mortgage is used as collateral for a mortgage pass-through
                           security, the mortgage is said to be securitized.


                           Mortgage Pass-Through Securities
                           The cash flows of a mortgage pass-through security depend on the monthly cash flows
                           of the underlying pool of mortgages. The amount and the timing of the cash flows
                           from the pool of mortgages cover both the cash flow passed through to the security
                           holders and administrative charges for servicing the pool; the structure is depicted
                           in Exhibit 2.

                           These administrative charges include collecting monthly payments from borrowers,
                           forwarding proceeds to owners of the loan, sending payment notices to borrowers,
                           maintaining records of the outstanding mortgage balance, initiating foreclosure pro-
                           ceedings if necessary, and providing tax information to borrowers when applicable.
                           Additionally, the issuer or financial guarantor of the mortgage pass-through security
                           may charge fees for guaranteeing the issue. All these fees are typically calculated as
                           a portion of the mortgage rate.
                              A comparison of MBS and RMBS can be found in Exhibit 3.

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS)                                                                        509


A mortgage pass-through security’s coupon rate is called the pass-through rate and
is lower than the weighted average mortgage rate earned on the underlying pool of
mortgages because of administrative charges. The pass-through rate that the investor
receives is said to be “net interest” or “net coupon.”
    The mortgages in a securitization pool are heterogeneous: outstanding principal,
interest rates, and maturities vary across the mortgages. Consequently, for each mort-
gage pass-through security, a weighted average coupon rate (WAC) and a weighted
average maturity (WAM) are determined. The WAC is calculated by weighting the
mortgage rate of each mortgage in the pool by the percentage of the outstanding
mortgage balance relative to the outstanding amount of all the mortgages in the pool.
Similarly, the WAM is calculated by weighting the remaining number of months to
maturity of each mortgage in the pool by the outstanding mortgage balance relative
to the outstanding amount of all the mortgages in the pool.

                           Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)
                           Collateralized mortgage obligations securitize mortgage pass-through securities
                           or multiple pools of loans. CMOs are structured to redistribute the cash flows to dif-
                           ferent bond classes or tranches and create securities that have different exposures to
                           prepayment risk. Exhibit 5 depicts a simplified CMO structure where the cash flows
                           are pooled and redistributed across the different tranches.

                           The tranching structure in the CMOs cannot eliminate prepayment risk, but it can
                           redistribute the prepayment risk across the different tranches, insulating some tranches
                           more than others. The CMO tranche structures reduce the uncertainties of the size
                           and timing of payments investors receive. The features of these tranches are designed
                           to specifically meet the various needs of institutional investors. Across the range of
                           CMO structures, the more senior a tranche is, the less exposure it has to prepayment
                           risk and default risk.

                           Sequential-Pay CMO
                           In sequential-pay CMO structures, each tranche would be retired sequentially. This is
                           an example of time tranching. One class begins to receive principal payments from the
                           underlying securities only after the principal on any previous class has been completely
                           paid off and retired. All principal payments are made to Tranche A until the principal
                           balance for Tranche A is zero. After Tranche A is paid off, the principal payments go
                           to Tranche B until the principal balance for Tranche B is zero. This continues until
                           all the tranches are repaid.
                                To illustrate a sequential-pay CMO, let us use a hypothetical transaction with
                           the terms outlined above. The collateral for this CMO is the mortgage pass-through
                           security described in Exhibit 2, where the total par value of the collateral is USD100
                           million, the pass-through coupon rate is 4%, the WAC is 4.55%, and the WAM is 360
                           months (about 30 years). From this collateral, three tranches are created, as shown in
                           Exhibit 6. The coupon rate varies with the differences in maturity and reflects the term
                           structure of interest rates, among other factors. Exhibit 6 shows the resulting structure.

Some protection against prepayment risk is provided for each tranche. The protection
arises because prioritizing the distribution of principal (that is, establishing the payment
rule for the principal repayment) effectively protects the shorter-term tranche (A in
this structure) against extension risk. This protection comes from the longer-term
tranches B and C. At the same time, Tranches B and C benefit because they are pro-
vided protection against contraction risk from Tranche A. Thus, the sequential-pay
CMO structure allows investors concerned about extension risk to invest in Tranche
A, and those concerned about contraction risk to invest in Tranches B and C.
    Although the payment rules for the distribution of the principal repayments are
known, the actual principal repayment amount in each month is not, as it depends
on the actual prepayment rate of the collateral. In the sequential-pay CMO structure,
the tranches have average lives that are shorter or longer than the collateral, thereby
attracting investors who have preferences for different average lives. A pension fund
that expects a significant increase in the number of retirements after several years
may opt for a tranche with a longer average life, such as Tranche B. An endowment
that looks to finance large building projects over the next few years may choose a
tranche with lower average life, such as Tranche A. And long-term investors willing
to assume more risk may select Tranche C.

                           Other CMO Structures
                           The cash flows from an underlying mortgage pool can be structured in additional
                           ways. The structures below describe various tranches that are created through time
                           tranching (Z-tranche and residual tranche) or by splitting up cash flows from the pool.
                               ■    Z-Tranches do not pay interest payments until a pre-set date, when both
                                    principal and accrued interest payments start. During the accrual period at
                                    each payment date, the principal value of the Z-tranche is credited by the
                                    stated coupon rate. Typically, Z-tranches are the last tranche in a series of
                                    sequential or PAC and companion tranches. A Z-tranche benefits the other
                                    tranches because it frees up cash flows that other tranches can distribute. At
                                    the same time, holders of the Z-tranche do not face reinvestment risk when
                                    market yields decline. Z-tranches usually have average lives in excess of 20
                                    years. This makes these tranches risky and hard to value. Z-tranches are also
                                    known as accretion bonds or accrual bonds.

   ■    Principal-Only (PO) securities pay only the principal repayments from the
        pool. These securities can be created either from mortgage pass-throughs
        or as a tranche in a CMO. Because PO investors receive the face value of
        their securities through scheduled principal payments and prepayments, the
        value of these securities is very sensitive to prepayment rates and interest
        rates. With falling interest rates or when prepayments accelerate, the value
        of the PO will increase.
   ■    Interest-Only (IO) securities pay their holders only the interest payments
        from the pool. IO securities are a companion of the PO securities in a CMO
        transaction. These securities have no face or par value. With increased
        prepayments, the cash flows paid to the IO investors decline. That is why
        investors use IOs to hedge their portfolios against interest rate risk.
   ■    Floating-Rate tranches carry interest rates that are linked to an index or a
        market reference rate. The interest rates are variable and are often subject
        to both a cap and a floor rate. These tranches are impacted by how interest
        rate movements affect prepayment rates. Floating-rate tranches can also be
        structured as inverse floaters, where the interest paid changes in the oppo-
        site direction of the change in interest rates. They are used to hedge interest
        rate risk in portfolios.
   ■    Residual tranches collect any remaining cash flow from the pool after all the
        obligations to the other tranches are met. These investments are appropriate
        for investors that can assume the risk and hedge it. Such investors include
        hedge funds and long-term institutional investors. Banks typically avoid
        such investments due to capital requirements.
   ■    A further evolution of the sequential pay CMO are CMOs that include
        Planned Amortization Class (PAC) tranches, occasionally accompanied by
        support tranches. PAC tranches offer greater predictability and stability of
        the cash flows. These tranches make scheduled and fixed principal payments
        over a predetermined time period to their investors if the prepayment levels
        in the pool are within a certain maximum and minimum range. If the pre-
        payment rate is within the specified range, all prepayment risk is absorbed
        by the support tranche.

                              1. The WAC for this security is closest to:
                                  A. 4.00%.
                                  B. 4.50%.

                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is C. The weighted average coupon is calculated by
                                 weighting the mortgage rate of each mortgage in the pool by the percentage
                                 of the outstanding mortgage balance relative to the outstanding amount of
                                 all the mortgages in the pool, as shown in the equation below.

                                 A is incorrect because it is calculated as a straight average of the five interest
                                 rates of the five mortgages in the pool.
                                 B is incorrect because it is calculated by weighting the mortgage rate of each
                                 mortgage in the pool by its percentage of the pool’s total beginning mort-
                                 gage balance, not by its percentage of the pool’s current mortgage balance.

                               1. A fund that is expected to provide                A. Tranche A
                               retirement benefits beginning in about
                               ten years
                               2. A long-term fund seeking high                     B. Tranche B
                               returns
                               3. A foundation that expects to award                C. Tranche C

                               avoid extension risk
                                                                                ​




                                 Solution:

                                  1. B is correct. A fund that expects to provide retirement benefits in
                                     about ten years may opt for a tranche, such as Tranche B. (In the
                                     sequential-pay CMO structure, the tranches have average lives that
                                     are shorter or longer than the underlying collateral, thereby attracting
                                     investors who have preferences for different average lives.)
                                  2. C is correct. A long-term fund seeking high returns would most
                                     likely be willing to assume more risk in order to achieve those higher
                                     returns. Tranche C has the longest term and is the riskiest of the three
                                     tranches.

       3. A is correct. A foundation that requires funding within the next few
          years and thus wants to avoid extension risk (the risk that borrowers
          will slow down payments and not meet scheduled payment timelines)
          most likely would opt for Tranche A.

   3. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentences:

      The tranching structure in the CMOs cannot eliminate _________________
      but can redistribute it across the different tranches, insulating some
      more than others. Across the range of CMO structures, the more se-
      nior a tranche is, the less exposure it has to _____________________ and
      _________________.
      Solution:
      The tranching structure in the CMOs cannot eliminate prepayment risk but
      can redistribute it across the different tranches, insulating some more than
      others. Across the range of CMO structures, the more senior a tranche is,
      the less exposure it has to prepayment risk and default risk.




COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
(CMBS)                                                                                         5
              describe characteristics and risks of commercial mortgage-backed
              securities

Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are backed by a pool of commer-
cial mortgages on income-producing property, such as multifamily properties (e.g.,
apartment buildings), office buildings, industrial properties (including warehouses),
shopping centers, hotels, and health care facilities (e.g., senior housing care facilities).
Repayment can be made from leases and other revenue the property generates. The
collateral is a pool of commercial loans that were originated either to finance a com-
mercial property acquisition or to refinance a prior mortgage obligation. Exhibit 7
provides an example of a CMBS structure where the mortgages on several properties
owned by the hypothetical car manufacturer Bright Wheel Automotive (BRWA), used
in previous lessons, are securitized.

                           In this specific transaction, properties valued at GBP123 million serve as collateral
                           for GBP100 million mortgages, giving an LTV of 81.3%, which provides GBP23 mil-
                           lion excess collateral for the mortgage lender. The lender then transfers the GBP100
                           million mortgages to an independent entity, Commercial Finance Associates, which
                           then through the securitization process issues securities backed by the mortgages.
                           Effectively, the weighted average proceeds from the mortgages (WAMP) are 4.66%
                           and the weighted coupon payment 4.075%, where the spread provides compensation
                           for arranging the securitization. For simplicity, all the mortgages are fully amortizing;
                           in practice, commercial mortgages are balloon loans and not fully amortizing.
                               An additional feature of this transaction is that the cash flows do not immediately
                           match across time horizons, including a Tranche A that is repaid in 3 years and carries
                           a lower interest rate than any of the mortgages. However, the pool generates sufficient
                           cash flows to make these payments, and the mortgages do not allow any prepayment
                           during their first 5 years.
                               CMBS transactions are common in many markets. In the United States, CMBS
                           transactions pool a larger number of commercial mortgages. Some transactions focus
                           on mortgages on specific property types (such as warehouses and multi-family resi-
                           dential) or specific geographic areas (such as the Northeast or the Southwest United
                           States). Others pool commercial mortgages from one lender. A small, but sizable,
                           portion of the US market focuses on securitizing a single loan backed typically by
                           one high value, marquee property in a major city. Akin to these single asset deals are
                           single borrower deals where the CMBS transaction securitizes multiple commercial
                           mortgage loans from one borrower.
                               Outside the United States, the volume of CMBS transactions is growing, particularly
                           in Europe. European CMBS transactions have some structural differences reflecting
                           differences in legal standards, commercial credit conventions, and bankruptcy. For
                           instance, many European CMBS securitize a few loans in each transaction, but these
                           loans can originate from different European countries. This introduces legal risk to
                           the transaction because in the event of foreclosure or bankruptcy, the sale of the
                           property must follow local rules that can be vastly different across Europe. Typically,
                           European CMBS carry a floating rate, but that rate may be capped, while US CMBS

usually pay a fixed rate and only occasionally offer a floating rate. Overall, CMBS deals
require more direct understanding of the legal, financial, and commercial structures
underlying each mortgage in the securitization transaction.


CMBS Structure
Both the CMBS and RMBS securitization processes and securitization structures,
respectively are highly similar. However, two features specific to CMBS structures are
worth mentioning: the presence of call protection and the balloon maturity provision.

Call Protection
A critical investment feature that distinguishes CMBS from RMBS is the protection
against early prepayments. Call protection is available to investors in CMBS, which
results in CMBS trading more like corporate bonds than RMBS. The call protection
comes either at the structure level or at the loan level.
    Structural call protection is achieved through sequential-pay tranches in the
CMBS: A lower-rated tranche cannot be paid down until the higher-rated tranche
is completely retired. Principal losses are always borne by the junior tranches first.
    Call protection on the individual loan level relies on three mechanisms, usually
through covenants. The first is prepayment lockout, a contractual agreement that
prohibits any prepayments during a specified period. Second, the loan agreement can
also stipulate prepayment penalty points, predetermined penalties that a borrower
who wants to refinance must pay to the CMBS SPE. A point is equal to 1.00% of the
outstanding loan balance.
    Third, defeasance is a mechanism that allows prepayment, but the borrower must
purchase a portfolio of government securities that fully replicates the cash flows of
the remaining scheduled principal and interest payments, including the balloon loan
balance, on the loan. When the last obligation is paid off, the value of the portfolio is
zero (that is, no funds remain). The cost of assembling such a portfolio is the cost of
defeasing the loan that must be paid by the issuer.

Balloon Maturity Provision
Another material difference lies in the structure of commercial mortgages. Unlike most
residential mortgages, which are self-amortizing, commercial real estate loans are not
fully amortizing. They usually pay interest payments and some principal repayments
throughout the loan with the balance of the unamortized principal repaid at maturity
through a large “balloon” payment. At loan maturity (e.g., the end of year 5 or year 10),
the borrower must make the remaining balloon payment to pay down the principal.
    Many commercial loans backing CMBS are balloon loans that require a substantial
principal repayment at the maturity of the loan. There are several reasons why a bor-
rower may fail to make the balloon payment at maturity. First, the borrower may not
be able to refinance the existing mortgage to roll the balloon loan into a new loan due
to the borrower’s deteriorating debt service coverage or LTV ratios. Lenders also may
not be able to extend the terms of the existing loan given the economic environment.
Finally, the borrower may not be able to sell the property to generate sufficient funds
to pay off the outstanding principal balance.
    Balloon risk is the risk that the borrower fails to make the balloon payment at
maturity and is in default. In this case, the lender may extend the loan over a period
known as the “workout period,” and modify the original terms of the loan during
the workout period. Because the life of the loan is extended by the lender during the
workout period, balloon risk is a type of extension risk.

                           CMBS Risks
                           Another significant difference between RMBS and CMBS is that a RMBS pool may
                           consist of thousands of mortgages from various parts of a country, while CMBS can
                           consist of a few underlying commercial mortgages. With RMBS collateralized by
                           relatively homogeneous single-family residential properties, individual defaults can
                           be frequent but have minimal impact on security holders due to the small size of any
                           one mortgage in the RMBS pool. A single default in a CMBS pool, on the other hand,
                           can have a significant impact on the CMBS investors. Investors in the CMBS must
                           explicitly consider this unique concentration risk by not only analyzing the CMBS
                           structure but also by analyzing the individual loans and properties backing the CMBS
                           and the owners of the commercial properties themselves.
                               In commercial real estate lending, the key indicators of potential credit performance
                           are the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which was discussed earlier, and the debt service
                           coverage ratio (DSCR or DSC ratio), like the debt-to-income ratio. The DSC ratio is
                           equal to the property’s annual net operating income (NOI) divided by the debt service.
                                       Net Operating Income
                               	​DSC = ________________
                                       ​   
                                          Debt Service ​

                           NOI is defined as the rental income reduced by cash operating expenses and a non-cash
                           replacement reserve reflecting the depreciation of the property over time.
                               	​NOI = ​(Rental income − cash operating expenses)​− replacement reserves​.
                           NOI excludes principal and interest payments on loans, capital expenditures, depre-
                           ciation, and amortization.
                               Note that debt service is the annual amount of interest payments and principal
                           repayments. A DSC ratio that exceeds 1.0× indicates that the cash flows from the
                           property are sufficient to cover the debt service while maintaining the property in its
                           initial state of repair. The higher the DSC ratio, the more likely it is that the borrower
                           will be able to meet debt-servicing requirements from the property’s cash flows.

                            EXAMPLE 5

                              The first property listed in Exhibit 7 has an estimated fair market value of GBP27
                              million. Its net operating income is GBP7,590,000 million. With annual debt
                              service of GBP4,717,169 its DSC ratio is 1.61×, as shown below. This DSC level
                              indicates that the property’s cash flows are more than sufficient to cover the debt
                              service while maintaining the property in its initial state of repair.​​
                                          GBP 7, 590, 000
                                          ____________

                                          ​GBP 4, 717, 169 ​= 1.61×.

                                  Lenders must evaluate the cash flow generating capacity of the property
                              closely because commercial mortgages are non-recourse loans, where the lenders
                              can look only to the income-producing property serving as collateral for the
                              loan to satisfy the debt in foreclosure.

                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is A. The debt service coverage ratio (DSC) is calculated
                                 as:
                                           Net Operating Income
                                  	​DSC = ________________

                                  	​DSC = _____________________________________

                                           ​(60, 000 − 9, 500 )​
                                  	​ SC = _____________
                                  D

                                          ​ 36, 110 ​ = 1.3985​×.

                                 B and C are incorrect because the calculated DSC ratio is above 1.0×, not
                                 equal to or below 1.

                              3. Which of the following mechanisms is least likely to offer investors protec-
                                 tion from default on the individual loan level?
                                  A. Defeasance
                                  B. Balloon payment structure
                                  C. Prepayment penalty points
                                 Solution:
                                 The correct answer is B. Typically, commercial real estate loans are not
                                 fully amortizing and thus require the unamortized principal to be repaid at

     maturity through a large “balloon” payment. If the borrower fails to make
     the balloon payment at maturity and is in default, then balloon risk results.
     Thus, the balloon payment structure increases risk to investors, rather than
     protecting against it. A is incorrect because defeasance, a mechanism that
     requires the borrower to purchase a portfolio of government securities that
     replicates the cash flows of the remaining scheduled principal and inter-
     est payments remaining on the loan, protects the investor. C is incorrect
     because prepayment penalty points (i.e., predetermined penalties that a
     borrower who wants to refinance must pay to the lender) offer investors call
     protection on the individual loan level.

  4. Relative to RMBS loan pools, CMBS loan pools exhibit less:
      A. credit risk.
      B. prepayment risk.
      C. concentration risk.
     Solution:
     The correct answer is B. CMBS loans exhibit less prepayment risk because
     commercial loans either do not offer prepayment options or make prepay-
     ment uneconomical. Conversely, RMBS loans are freely prepayable, thus
     prepayment risk is higher. A is incorrect because CMBS loans have higher
     credit risk because the assets backing the CMBS can be concentrated in
     one mortgage or a small number of mortgages (as compared to the large
     number backing an RMBS). In addition, agency RMBS are issued and fully
     guaranteed by the government or a quasi-government entity, and non-agen-
     cy RMBS are issued by banks, financial institutions, or other private busi-
     nesses, which use credit enhancements to reduce credit risk. C is incorrect
     because CMBS loan pools exhibit more concentration risk than RMBS loan
     pools. CMBS loan pools exhibit a fewer number of loans and will have some
     larger loans that create concentration risk.

                               term of five years. AR&C retains ownership of the jets. The corporations make
                               equal interest payments each month. If a customer defaults, AR&C can repossess
                               the jet. AR&C has been in business for approximately fifteen years and has a B3
                               credit rating, meaning that its debt is non-investment grade. AR&C has CAD500
                               million in leases on its balance sheet that it wants to securitize into ABS.

   SOLUTIONS
1. The correct answer is C. The Class A bonds issued by the SPE are backed by col-
   lateral, the leases sold by AR&C to the SPE, and they are the most senior of the
   bonds issued by the SPE. A secured bond is secured by collateral and is consid-
   ered less risky than a bond without collateral backing. The Class A bonds issued
   by the SPE would most likely be rated higher than any unsecured corporate bonds
   issued directly by AR&C.

2. The correct answer is B. Losses are realized by the subordinated bond classes
   before any losses are realized by the senior Class A bonds. A is incorrect because
   this senior/subordinated structure is an example of credit tranching, not time
   tranching. C is incorrect because in a waterfall structure such as this one, the
   most junior tranche, Class D, will absorb all losses up to its full CAD50 million
   par value first. Then, if credit losses exceed that threshold, Bond Class C will ab-
   sorb all losses up to its full CAD100 million par value. The losses are not shared
   proportionally across all subordinated bond classes; instead, they are absorbed by
   the most junior classes first and subsequently by the more senior ones up to the
   value of the loss.

3. The correct answer is C. The loan-to-value ratio (LTV) is the ratio of the amount
   of the loan/mortgage to the property’s value.
            Amount of the loan / mortgage
            _____________________
   	​ LTV =

   	​ TV = _

   	​LTV = 70%​.
   A is incorrect because it was calculated as the monthly payment divided by the
   beginning loan value, not the loan to property value, as follows:
    2, 818.31
   	​ _
      ​525, 000 ​= 0.54%​.

   Note: This is 0.54%, not 54%. Choice A was adjusted to 54% to make the correct
   answer less obvious.
   B is incorrect because it was calculated as the monthly payment for a 20-year
   loan, not a 30-year loan, divided by the beginning loan value, not the loan to
   property value, as follows:
    3, 464.77
   	​ _
      ​525, 000 ​= 0.66%​.

   Note: This is 0.66%, not 66%. Choice B was adjusted to 66% to make the correct
   answer less obvious.

4. The correct answer is B. The DTI is calculated using the monthly debt payment
   and the borrower’s monthly pre-tax gross income, as follows:
                 Monthly Debt Payment
   	​DTI = _______________________
           ​Monthly

                               C is incorrect because it was calculated as the starting loan value divided by the
                               annual pre-tax gross income, as follows:
                               _  525, 000
                               	​ 210, 000 ​ = 250.00%​.

                           5. The correct answer is C. If the prepayment rate is within the specified range,
                              all prepayment risk is absorbed by the support tranche. This provides greater
                              predictability of the size and timing of cash flows paid to investors in the PAC
                              tranches.
                              A is incorrect because in a CMO that includes a PAC tranche, the PAC tranche is
                              protected from prepayment risk because all prepayment risk is absorbed by the
                              support tranche.
                              B is incorrect because in a CMO that includes a PAC tranche, the senior (PAC)
                              tranche is protected from prepayment risk because all prepayment risk is ab-
                              sorbed by the support tranche.

                           6. The correct answer is A. The tranching structure in CMOs cannot eliminate pre-
                              payment risk, but it can redistribute prepayment risk across the different tranch-
                              es, insulating some tranches more than others. CMO tranche structures reduce
                              the uncertainties of the size and timing of payments investors receive.
                              B and C are incorrect because excess spread and overcollateralization are both
                              common forms of credit enhancement, but they do not redistribute prepayment
                              risk.

                           7. The correct answer is C. The weighted average maturity is calculated by weight-
                              ing the number of months to maturity for each mortgage in the pool by the per-
                              centage of the outstanding mortgage balance relative to the outstanding amount
                              of all the mortgages in the pool, as shown in the following equation:

                               A is incorrect because it is calculated by averaging the months to maturity for the
                               five mortgages, rather than calculating their weighted average.
                               B is incorrect because it is calculated by weighting the number of months to ma-
                               turity for each mortgage in the pool by the percentage of the beginning mortgage
                               balance relative to the beginning amount of all the mortgages in the pool, not by
                               the current balances.

                           8. The correct answer is B. Extension risk is the risk that the borrower might pay
                              back the money borrowed more slowly than anticipated, extending the time
                              of repayment and the maturity of the bond. For investors, this has one adverse
                              consequence: Higher interest rates reduce the value of the cash flows investors
                              receive. The payments the investors receive will be discounted at a higher interest

   rate, and the extension stretches out the payments the investors receive.
   A is incorrect because contraction risk (the risk that the borrower might pay
   back the money borrowed more quickly than anticipated, reducing the amount of
   future payments the investor receives), not extension risk, has the adverse conse-
   quence that investors must reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates.
   C is incorrect because contraction risk (the risk that the borrower might pay
   back the money borrowed more quickly than anticipated, reducing the amount
   of future payments the investor receives), not extension risk, has the adverse
   consequence that the prepayment option reduces the potential price appreciation
   for the bond.

9. The correct answer is A. The associated loan to value ratio is calculated as the
   total value of all loans (mortgages) divided by the total value of the properties
   associated with the mortgages, as follows:
              Total value of all loans (​ mortgages)​
           ____________________________
   	​LTV =

   	​LTV = _
           ​110, 000, 000 ​ = 0.75​.

   B is incorrect because 0.77 is the value of just the mortgage on the first property
   (27,000,000) divided by the first property’s total value (35,000,000).
   C is incorrect because 0.80 is the value of just the mortgage on the third property
   (11,400,000) divided by the third property’s total value (15,000,000).

10. The correct answer is A. The weighted average coupon payment is calculated as
    the value of each tranche’s coupon rate weighted by the principal value of that
    tranche as a percentage of the total value of all tranches:

   	​WAC = ​iA​ ​ _

      WAC = 2.00%​(_   ​83, 000, 000 ​)​+ 3.00%​(_   ​83, 000, 000 ​)​
                         20, 000, 000                 22, 000, 000

       
   	​                                                                ​​
  + 4.00%​(_​83, 000, 000 ​)​+ 5.00%​(_   ​23, 000, 000 ​)​

   	​WAC = 3.47%​.
   B is incorrect because 3.50% is calculated as a straight average of the four coupon
   rates (of the four tranches), rather than a weighted average.
   C is incorrect because 3.61% is the weighted proceeds from the three mortgages,
   not the weighted average coupon payment.

11. The correct answer is C. The weighted average proceeds from the mortgages
    (WAMP shown below) is calculated as the coupon rate of each mortgage weight-
    ed by that mortgage’s value/amount as a percentage of the total value of all the
    mortgages:

                               A is incorrect because 3.47% is the weighted average coupon payment for the
                               four tranches, not the weighted average proceeds from the mortgages.
                               B is incorrect because 3.50% is calculated as a straight average of the four cou-
                               pon rates (of the four tranches), not the weighted average proceeds from the
                               mortgages.

                           12. The correct answer is C. A lack of property buyers in the market will make it
                               challenging for a borrower to sell a property to generate sufficient funds to pay
                               off the outstanding principal balance. A is incorrect because a high DSCR would
                               reduce the balloon risk. B is incorrect because a low LTV ratio would also reduce
                               the balloon risk of a maturing loan.

                           13. The correct answer is C. Structural call protection is achieved through
                               sequential-pay tranches in the CMBS as a lower-rated tranche cannot be paid
                               down until the higher-rated tranche is completely retired. A is incorrect because
                               defeasance provides call protection at the individual loan level. Defeasance allows
                               prepayment, but the borrower must purchase a portfolio of government securi-
                               ties that fully replicates the cash flows of the remaining scheduled principal and
                               interest payments, including the balloon loan balance, on the loan. B is incorrect
                               because prepayment lockout provides call protection at the individual loan level.
                               Prepayment lockout is a contractual agreement that prohibits any prepayments
                               during a specified period.
