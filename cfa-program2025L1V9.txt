                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.

    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the

    the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
    later review.
        Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
    exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
    and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




    ERRATA
    The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
    reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
    errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
    updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
    (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
    error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
    reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

INTRODUCTION
Construction of an optimal portfolio is an important objective for an investor. In this
                                                                                                1
reading, we will explore the process of examining the risk and return characteristics of
individual assets, creating all possible portfolios, selecting the most efficient portfolios,
and ultimately choosing the optimal portfolio tailored to the individual in question.
    During the process of constructing the optimal portfolio, several factors and invest-
ment characteristics are considered. The most important of those factors are risk and
return of the individual assets under consideration. Correlations among individual
assets along with risk and return are important determinants of portfolio risk. Creating
a portfolio for an investor requires an understanding of the risk profile of the investor.
Although we will not discuss the process of determining risk aversion for individuals
or institutional investors, it is necessary to obtain such information for making an
informed decision. In this reading, we will explain the broad types of investors and
how their risk–return preferences can be formalized to select the optimal portfolio
from among the infinite portfolios contained in the investment opportunity set.

                            The reading is organized as follows: Sections 2–3 discuss the investment character-
                        istics of assets. Sections 4–6 discuss risk aversion and how indifference curves, which
                        incorporate individual preferences, can be constructed. The indifference curves are
                        then applied to the selection of an optimal portfolio using two risky assets. Sections
                        7–9 provide an understanding and computation of portfolio risk. The role of cor-
                        relation and diversification of portfolio risk are examined in detail. Sections 10–12
                        begins with the risky assets available to investors and constructs a large number of
                        risky portfolios. It illustrates the process of narrowing the choices to an efficient set
                        of risky portfolios before identifying the optimal risky portfolio. The risky portfolio is
                        combined with investor risk preferences to generate the investor’s optimal portfolio.
                        A summary concludes this reading.




            2           HISTORICAL RETURN AND RISK

                                         describe characteristics of the major asset classes that investors
                                         consider in forming portfolios

                        Before examining historical data, it is useful to distinguish between the historical mean
                        return and expected return, which are very different concepts but easy to confuse.
                        Historical return is what was actually earned in the past, whereas expected return is
                        what an investor anticipates to earn in the future.
                            Expected return is the nominal return that would cause the marginal investor
                        to invest in an asset based on the real risk-free interest rate (rrF), expected inflation
                        [E(π)], and expected risk premium for the risk of the asset [E(RP)]. The real risk-free
                        interest rate is expected to be positive as compensation for postponing consumption.
                        Similarly, the risk premium is expected to be positive in most cases.1 The expected
                        inflation rate is generally positive, except when the economy is in a deflationary state
                        and prices are falling. Thus, expected return is generally positive. The relationship
                        between the expected return and the real risk-free interest rate, inflation rate, and
                        risk premium can be expressed by the following equation:
                            1 + E(R) = (1 + rrF) × [1 + E(π)] × [1 + E(RP)]
                        The historical mean return for investment in a particular asset, however, is obtained
                        from the actual return that was earned by an investor. Because the investment is
                        risky, there is no guarantee that the actual return will be equal to the expected return.
                        In fact, it is very unlikely that the two returns are equal for a specific time period
                        being considered. Given a long enough period of time, we can expect that the future
                        (expected) return will equal the average historical return. Unfortunately, we do not
                        know how long that period is—10 years, 50 years, or 100 years. As a practical matter,
                        we often assume that the historical mean return is an adequate representation of the
                        expected return, although this assumption may not be accurate. For example, Exhibit
                        1 shows that the historical equity returns in the last eight years (2010–2017) for large
                        US company stocks were positive whereas the actual return was negative the prior
                        decade, but nearly always positive historically. Nonetheless, longer-term returns
                        (1926–2017) were positive and could be consistent with expected return. Though it
                        is unknown if the historical mean returns accurately represent expected returns, it is
                        an assumption that is commonly made.



                        1 There are exceptions when an asset reduces overall risk of a portfolio. We will consider those exceptions
                        in Section 9.

Nominal Returns of Major US Asset Classes
We focus on three major asset categories in Exhibit 1: stocks, bonds, and T-bills. The
mean nominal returns for US asset classes are reported decade by decade since the
1930s. The total for the 1926–2017 period is in the last column. All returns are annual
geometric mean returns. Large company stocks had an overall annual return of 10.2
percent during the 92-year period. The return was negative in the 1930s and 2000s,
and positive in all remaining decades. The 1950s and 1990s were the best decades for
large company stocks. Small company stocks fared even better. The nominal return
was never negative for any decade, and had double-digit growth in all decades except
two, leading to an overall 92-year annual return of 12.1 percent.
    Long-term corporate bonds and long-term government bonds earned overall
returns of 6.1 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. The corporate bonds did not have
a single negative decade, although government bonds recorded a negative return in
the 1950s when stocks were doing extremely well. Bonds also had some excellent
decades, earning double-digit returns in the 1980s and 2000s.
    Treasury bills (short-term government securities) did not earn a negative return
in any decade. In fact, Treasury bills earned a negative return only in 1938 (–0.02
percent) when the inflation rate was –2.78 percent. Consistently positive returns for
Treasury bills are not surprising because nominal interest rates are almost never
negative and the Treasury bills suffer from little interest rate or inflation risk. Since
the Great Depression, there has been no deflation in any decade, although inflation
rates were highly negative in 1930 (–6.03 percent), 1931 (–9.52 percent), and 1932
(–10.30 percent). Conversely, inflation rates were very high in the late 1970s and early

                        1980s, reaching 13.31 percent in 1979. Inflation rates have been largely range bound
                        between 1 and 3 percent from 1991 to 2017. Overall, the inflation rate was 2.9 percent
                        for the 92-year period.


                        Real Returns of Major US Asset Classes
                        Because annual inflation rates can vary greatly, from –10.30 percent to +13.31 percent
                        in the last 92 years, comparisons across various time periods are difficult and mislead-
                        ing using nominal returns. Therefore, it is more effective to rely on real returns. Real
                        returns on stocks, bonds, and T-bills are reported from 1900 in Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3.

                        Exhibit 2 shows that $1 would have grown to $1,654 if invested in stocks, to only $10.20
                        if invested in bonds, and to $2.60 if invested in T-bills. The difference in growth among
                        the three asset categories is huge, although the difference in real returns does not seem
                        that large: 6.5 percent per year for equities compared with 2.0 percent per year for
                        bonds. This difference represents the effect of compounding over a 118-year period.
                             Exhibit 3 reports real rates of return. As we discussed earlier and as shown in
                        the table, geometric mean is never greater than the arithmetic mean. Our analysis of
                        returns focuses on the geometric mean because it is a more accurate representation
                        of returns for multiple holding periods than the arithmetic mean. We observe that
                        the real returns for stocks are higher than the real returns for bonds.

Nominal and Real Returns of Asset Classes in Major Countries
Along with US returns, real returns of major asset classes for a 21-country world and
the world excluding the United States are also presented in Exhibit 3. Equity returns
are weighted by each country’s GDP before 1968 because of a lack of reliable market
capitalization data. Returns are weighted by a country’s market capitalization beginning
with 1968. Similarly, bond returns are defined by a 21-country bond index, except GDP
is used to create the weights because equity market capitalization weighting is inap-
propriate for a bond index and bond market capitalizations were not readily available.
    The real geometric mean return for the world stock index over the last 117 years
was 5.2 percent, and bonds had a real geometric mean return of 2.0 percent. The real
geometric mean return for the world excluding the United States were 4.5 percent
for stocks and 1.7 percent for bonds. For both stocks and bonds, the United States
earned higher returns than the world excluding the United States. Similarly, real
returns for stocks and bonds in the United States were higher than the real returns
for rest of the world.


Risk of Major Asset Classes
Risk for major asset classes in the United States is reported for 1926–2017 in Exhibit
1, and the risk for major asset classes for the United States, the world, and the world
excluding the United States are reported for 1900–2017 in Exhibit 3. Exhibit 1 shows
that US small company stocks had the highest risk, 31.7 percent, followed by US large
company stocks, 19.8 percent. Long-term government bonds and long-term corporate
bonds had lower risk at 9.9 percent and 8.3 percent, with Treasury bills having the
lowest risk at about 3.1 percent.
    Exhibit 3 shows that the risk for world stocks is 17.4 percent and for world bonds
is 11.0 percent. The world excluding the United States has risks of 18.9 percent for
stocks and 14.4 percent for bonds. The effect of diversification is apparent when world
risk is compared with US risk and world excluding US risk. Although the risk of US
stocks is 20.0 percent and the risk of world excluding US stocks is 18.9 percent, the
combination gives a risk of only 17.4 percent for world stocks.

                        Risk–Return Trade-off
                        The expression “risk–return trade-off ” refers to the positive relationship between
                        expected risk and return. In other words, a higher return is not possible to attain
                        in efficient markets and over long periods of time without accepting higher risk.
                        Expected returns should be greater for assets with greater risk.
                            The historical data presented above show the risk–return trade-off. Exhibit 1 shows
                        for the United States that small company stocks had higher risk and higher return
                        than large company stocks. Large company stocks had higher returns and higher
                        risk than both long-term corporate bonds and government bonds. Bonds had higher
                        returns and higher risk than Treasury bills. Uncharacteristically, however, long-term
                        government bonds had higher total risk than long-term corporate bonds, although
                        the returns of corporate bonds were slightly higher. These factors do not mean that
                        long-term government bonds had greater default risk, just that they were more variable
                        than corporate bonds during this historic period.
                            Exhibit 3 reveals that the risk and return for stocks were the highest of the asset
                        classes, and the risk and return for bonds were lower than stocks for the United States,
                        the world, and the world excluding the United States.
                            Another way of looking at the risk–return trade-off is to focus on the risk pre-
                        mium, which is the extra return investors can expect for assuming additional risk, after
                        accounting for the risk-free interest rate. The nominal risk premium is the nominal
                        risky return minus the nominal risk-free rate (which includes both compensation for
                        expected inflation and the real risk-free interest rate). The real risk premium is the real
                        risky return minus the real risk-free rate. Worldwide equity risk premiums reported at
                        the bottom of Exhibit 3 show that equities outperformed bonds. Investors in equities
                        earned a higher return than investors in bonds because of the higher risk in equities.
                            A more dramatic representation of the risk–return trade-off is shown in Exhibit
                        2, which shows the cumulative returns of US asset classes in real terms. The line rep-
                        resenting T-bills is much less volatile than the other lines. Adjusted for inflation, the
                        average real return on T-bills was 0.8 percent per year. The line representing bonds
                        is more volatile than the line for T-bills but less volatile than the line representing
                        stocks. The total return for equities including dividends and capital gains shows how
                        $1 invested at the beginning of 1900 grows to $1,654, generating an annualized return
                        of 6.5 percent in real terms.
                            Over long periods of time, we observe that higher risk does result in higher mean
                        returns. Thus, it is reasonable to claim that, over the long term, market prices reward
                        higher risk with higher returns, which is a characteristic of a risk-averse investor, a
                        topic that we discuss in Section 4.




            3           OTHER INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS

                                      describe characteristics of the major asset classes that investors
                                      consider in forming portfolios

                        In evaluating investments using only the mean (expected return) and variance (risk),
                        we are implicitly making two important assumptions: 1) that the returns are normally
                        distributed and can be fully characterized by their means and variances and 2) that
                        markets are not only informationally efficient but that they are also operationally
                        efficient. To the extent that these assumptions are violated, we need to consider
                        additional investment characteristics. These are discussed below.

Other Investment Characteristics                                                                                 9



Distributional Characteristics
As explained in an earlier reading, a normal distribution has three main characteris-
tics: its mean and median are equal; it is completely defined by two parameters, mean
and variance; and it is symmetric around its mean with:
    ■    68 percent of the observations within ±1σ of the mean,
    ■    95 percent of the observations within ±2σ of the mean, and
    ■    99 percent of the observations within ±3σ of the mean.
    Using only mean and variance would be appropriate to evaluate investments if
returns were distributed normally. Returns, however, are not normally distributed;
deviations from normality occur both because the returns are skewed, which means
they are not symmetric around the mean, and because the probability of extreme
events is significantly greater than what a normal distribution would suggest. The
latter deviation is referred to as kurtosis or fat tails in a return distribution. The next
sections discuss these deviations more in-depth.



Skewness
Skewness refers to asymmetry of the return distribution, that is, returns are not
symmetric around the mean. A distribution is said to be left skewed or negatively
skewed if most of the distribution is concentrated to the right, and right skewed or
positively skewed if most is concentrated to the left. Exhibit 4 shows a typical rep-
resentation of negative and positive skewness, whereas Exhibit 5 demonstrates the
negative skewness of stock returns by plotting a histogram of US large company stock
returns for 1926–2017.

                         Kurtosis
                         Kurtosis refers to fat tails or higher than normal probabilities for extreme returns
                         and has the effect of increasing an asset’s risk that is not captured in a mean–variance
                         framework, as illustrated in Exhibit 6. Investors try to evaluate the effect of kurtosis
                         by using such statistical techniques as value at risk (VaR) and conditional tail expec-
                         tations.2 Several market participants note that the probability and the magnitude
                         of extreme events is underappreciated and was a primary contributing factor to the
                         financial crisis of 2008.3 The higher probability of extreme negative outcomes among
                         stock returns can also be observed in Exhibit 5.




                         2 Value at risk is a money measure of the minimum losses expected on a portfolio during a specified time
                         period at a given level of probability. It is commonly used to measure the losses a portfolio can suffer under
                         normal market conditions. For example, if a portfolio’s one-day 10 percent VaR is £200,000, it implies that
                         there is a 10 percent probability that the value of the portfolio will decrease by more than £200,000 over
                         a single one-day period (under normal market conditions). This probability implies that the portfolio will
                         experience a loss of at least £200,000 on one out of every ten days.

Market Characteristics
In the previous analysis, we implicitly assumed that markets are both informationally
and operationally efficient. Although informational efficiency of markets is a topic
beyond the purview of this reading, we should highlight certain operational limitations
of the market that affect the choice of investments. One such limitation is liquidity.
    The cost of trading has three main components—brokerage commission, bid–ask
spread, and price impact. Liquidity affects the latter two. Stocks with low liquidity
can have wide bid–ask spreads. The bid–ask spread, which is the difference between
the buying price and the selling price, is incurred as a cost of trading a security. The
larger the bid–ask spread, the higher the cost of trading. If a $100 stock has a spread
of 10 cents, the bid–ask spread is only 0.1 percent ($0.10/$100). On the other hand, if
a $10 stock has a spread of 10 cents, the bid–ask spread is 1 percent. Clearly, the $10
stock is more expensive to trade and an investor will need to earn 0.9 percent extra
to make up the higher cost of trading relative to the $100 stock.
    Liquidity also has implications for the price impact of trade. Price impact refers
to how the price moves in response to an order in the market. Small orders usually
have little impact, especially for liquid stocks. For example, an order to buy 100 shares
of a $100 stock with a spread of 1 cent may have no effect on the price. On the other
hand, an order to buy 100,000 shares may have a significant impact on the price as the
buyer has to induce more and more stockholders to tender their shares. The extent of
the price impact depends on the liquidity of the stock. A stock that trades millions of
shares a day may be less affected than a stock that trades only a few hundred thou-
sand shares a day. Investors, especially institutional investors managing large sums of
money, must keep the liquidity of a stock in mind when making investment decisions.
    Liquidity is a bigger concern in emerging markets than in developed markets
because of the smaller volume of trading in those markets. Similarly, liquidity is a
more important concern in corporate bond markets and especially for bonds of lower

                         credit quality than in equity markets because an individual corporate bond issue may
                         not trade for several days or weeks. This certainly became apparent during the global
                         financial crisis.
                             There are other market-related characteristics that affect investment decisions
                         because they might instill greater confidence in the security or might affect the costs
                         of doing business. These include analyst coverage, availability of information, firm
                         size, etc. These characteristics about companies and financial markets are essential
                         components of investment decision making.




             4           RISK AVERSION AND PORTFOLIO SELECTION

                                        explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection

                         As we have seen, stocks, bonds, and T-bills provide different levels of returns and have
                         different levels of risk. Although investment in equities may be appropriate for one
                         investor, another investor may not be inclined to accept the risk that accompanies a
                         share of stock and may prefer to hold more cash. In the last section, we considered
                         investment characteristics of assets in understanding their risk and return. In this
                         section, we consider the characteristics of investors, both individual and institutional,
                         in an attempt to pair the right kind of investors with the right kind of investments.
                             First, we discuss risk aversion and utility theory. Later we discuss their implications
                         for portfolio selection.


                         The Concept of Risk Aversion
                         The concept of risk aversion is related to the behavior of individuals under uncer-
                         tainty. Assume that an individual is offered two alternatives: one where he will get
                         £50 for sure and the other is a gamble with a 50 percent chance that he gets £100 and
                         50 percent chance that he gets nothing. The expected value in both cases is £50, one
                         with certainty and the other with uncertainty. What will an investor choose? There
                         are three possibilities: an investor chooses the gamble, the investor chooses £50 with
                         certainty, or the investor is indifferent. Let us consider each in turn. However, please
                         understand that this is only a representative example, and a single choice does not
                         determine the risk aversion of an investor.

                         Risk Seeking
                         If an investor chooses the gamble, then the investor is said to be risk loving or risk
                         seeking. The gamble has an uncertain outcome, but with the same expected value
                         as the guaranteed outcome. Thus, an investor choosing the gamble means that the
                         investor gets extra “utility” from the uncertainty associated with the gamble. How
                         much is that extra utility worth? Would the investor be willing to accept a smaller
                         expected value because he gets extra utility from risk? Indeed, risk seekers will accept
                         less return because of the risk that accompanies the gamble. For example, a risk seeker
                         may choose a gamble with an expected value of £45 in preference to a guaranteed
                         outcome of £50.
                             There is a little bit of gambling instinct in many of us. People buy lottery tickets
                         although the expected value is less than the money they pay to buy it. Or people gamble
                         at casinos with the full knowledge that the expected return is negative, a characteristic
                         of risk seekers. These or any other isolated actions, however, cannot be taken at face
                         value except for compulsive gamblers.

Risk Neutral
If an investor is indifferent about the gamble or the guaranteed outcome, then the
investor may be risk neutral. Risk neutrality means that the investor cares only about
return and not about risk, so higher return investments are more desirable even if they
come with higher risk. Many investors may exhibit characteristics of risk neutrality
when the investment at stake is an insignificant part of their wealth. For example, a
billionaire may be indifferent about choosing the gamble or a £50 guaranteed outcome.

Risk Averse
If an investor chooses the guaranteed outcome, he/she is said to be risk averse because
the investor does not want to take the chance of not getting anything at all. Depending
on the level of aversion to risk, an investor may be willing to accept a guaranteed
outcome of £45 instead of a gamble with an expected value of £50.
    In general, investors are likely to shy away from risky investments for a lower, but
guaranteed return. That is why they want to minimize their risk for the same amount
of return, and maximize their return for the same amount of risk. The risk–return
trade-off discussed earlier is an indicator of risk aversion. A risk-neutral investor would
maximize return irrespective of risk and a risk-seeking investor would maximize both
risk and return.
    Data presented in the last section illustrate the historically positive relationship
between risk and return, which demonstrates that market prices were based on trans-
actions and investments by risk-averse investors and reflect risk aversion. Therefore,
for all practical purposes and for our future discussion, we will assume that the repre-
sentative investor is a risk-averse investor. This assumption is the standard approach
taken in the investment industry globally.

Risk Tolerance
Risk tolerance refers to the amount of risk an investor can tolerate to achieve an
investment goal. The higher the risk tolerance, the greater is the willingness to take
risk. Thus, risk tolerance is negatively related to risk aversion.




UTILITY THEORY AND INDIFFERENCE CURVES
                                                                                              5
               explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection

Continuing with our previous example, a risk-averse investor would rank the guar-
anteed outcome of £50 higher than the uncertain outcome with an expected value
of £50. We can say that the utility that an investor or an individual derives from the
guaranteed outcome of £50 is greater than the utility or satisfaction or happiness he/
she derives from the alternative. In general terms, utility is a measure of relative satis-
faction from consumption of various goods and services or in the case of investments,
the satisfaction that an investor derives from a portfolio.
    Because individuals are different in their preferences, all risk-averse individuals
may not rank investment alternatives in the same manner. Consider the £50 gamble
again. All risk-averse individuals will rank the guaranteed outcome of £50 higher than
the gamble. What if the guaranteed outcome is only £40? Some risk-averse investors
might consider £40 inadequate, others might accept it, and still others may now be
indifferent about the uncertain £50 and the certain £40.

                             A simple implementation of utility theory allows us to quantify the rankings of
                         investment choices using risk and return. There are several assumptions about indi-
                         vidual behavior that we make in the definition of utility given in the equation below.
                         We assume that investors are risk averse. They always prefer more to less (greater
                         return to lesser return). They are able to rank different portfolios in the order of their
                         preference and that the rankings are internally consistent. If an individual prefers X
                         to Y and Y to Z, then he/she must prefer X to Z. This property implies that the indif-
                         ference curves (see Exhibit 7) for the same individual can never touch or intersect.
                         An example of a utility function is given below

                                           ​12 ​A ​σ​2​
                             	​U = E​(r)​− _

                             where, U is the utility of an investment, E(r) is the expected return, and σ2 is the
                         variance of the investment.
                             In the above equation, A is a measure of risk aversion, which is measured as the
                         marginal reward that an investor requires to accept additional risk. More risk-averse
                         investors require greater compensation for accepting additional risk. Thus, A is higher
                         for more risk-averse individuals. As was mentioned previously, a risk-neutral investor
                         would maximize return irrespective of risk and a risk-seeking investor would maxi-
                         mize both risk and return.
                             We can draw several conclusions from the utility function. First, utility is unbounded
                         on both sides. It can be highly positive or highly negative. Second, higher return
                         contributes to higher utility. Third, higher variance reduces the utility but the reduc-
                         tion in utility gets amplified by the risk aversion coefficient, A. Utility can always be
                         increased, albeit marginally, by getting higher return or lower risk. Fourth, utility does
                         not indicate or measure satisfaction itself—it can be useful only in ranking various
                         investments. For example, a portfolio with a utility of 4 is not necessarily two times
                         better than a portfolio with a utility of 2. The portfolio with a utility of 4 could increase
                         our happiness 10 times or just marginally. But we do prefer a portfolio with a utility
                         of 4 to a portfolio with a utility of 2. Utility cannot be compared among individuals
                         or investors because it is a very personal concept. From a societal point of view, by
                         the same argument, utility cannot be summed among individuals.
                             Let us explore the utility function further. The risk aversion coefficient, A, is greater
                         than zero for a risk-averse investor. So any increase in risk reduces his/her utility. The
                         risk aversion coefficient for a risk-neutral investor is 0, and changes in risk do not
                         affect his/her utility. For a risk lover, the risk aversion coefficient is negative, creating
                         an inverse situation so that additional risk contributes to an increase in his/her utility.
                         Note that a risk-free asset (σ2 = 0) generates the same utility for all individuals.


                         Indifference Curves
                         An indifference curve plots the combinations of risk–return pairs that an investor
                         would accept to maintain a given level of utility (i.e., the investor is indifferent about
                         the combinations on any one curve because they would provide the same level of
                         overall utility). Indifference curves are thus defined in terms of a trade-off between
                         expected rate of return and variance of the rate of return. Because an infinite number
                         of combinations of risk and return can generate the same utility for the same investor,
                         indifference curves are continuous at all points.

A set of indifference curves is plotted in Exhibit 7. By definition, all points on any one
of the three curves have the same utility. An investor does not care whether he/she is
at Point a or Point b on indifference Curve 1. Point a has lower risk and lower return
than Point b, but the utility of both points is the same because the higher return at
Point b is offset by the higher risk.
    Like Curve 1, all points on Curve 2 have the same utility and an investor is indif-
ferent about where he/she is on Curve 2. Now compare Point c with Point b. Point
c has the same risk but significantly lower return than Point b, which means that
the utility at Point c is less than the utility at Point b. Given that all points on Curve
1 have the same utility and all points on Curve 2 have the same utility and Point b
has higher utility than Point c, Curve 1 has higher utility than Curve 2. Therefore, a
risk-averse investor with indifference Curves 1 and 2 will prefer Curve 1 to Curve 2.
The utility of a risk-averse investor always increases as you move northwest—higher
return with lower risk. Because all investors prefer more utility to less, investors want
to move northwest to the indifference curve with the highest utility.
    The indifference curve for risk-averse investors runs from the southwest to the
northeast because of the risk–return trade-off. If risk increases (going east) then it
must be compensated by higher return (going north) to generate the same utility. The
indifference curves are convex because of diminishing marginal utility of return (or
wealth). As risk increases, an investor needs greater return to compensate for higher
risk at an increasing rate (i.e., the curve gets steeper). The upward-sloping convex
indifference curve has a slope coefficient closely related to the risk aversion coeffi-
cient. The greater the slope, the higher is the risk aversion of the investor as a greater
increment in return is required to accept a given increase in risk.
    Indifference curves for investors with different levels of risk aversion are plotted
in Exhibit 8. The most risk-averse investor has an indifference curve with the greatest
slope. As volatility increases, this investor demands increasingly higher returns to
compensate for risk. The least risk-averse investor has an indifference curve with the
least slope and so the demand for higher return as risk increases is not as acute as for
the more risk-averse investor. The risk-loving investor’s indifference curve, however,
exhibits a negative slope, implying that the risk-lover is happy to substitute risk for

                         return. For a risk lover, the utility increases both with higher risk and higher return.
                         Finally, the indifference curves of risk-neutral investors are horizontal because the
                         utility is invariant with risk.

                         In the remaining parts of this reading, all investors are assumed to be risk averse
                         unless stated otherwise.

                          EXAMPLE 1

                            Comparing a Gamble with a Guaranteed Outcome
                            Assume that you are given an investment with an expected return of 10 percent
                            and a risk (standard deviation) of 20 percent, and your risk aversion coefficient
                            is 3.

                            1. What is your utility of this investment?
                               Solution:
                               U = 0.10 − 0.5 × 3 × 0.202 = 0.04.

                            2. What must be the minimum risk-free return you should earn to get the
                               same utility?
                               Solution:
                               A risk-free return’s σ is zero, so the second term disappears. To get the same
                               utility (0.04), the risk-free return must be at least 4 percent. Thus, in your
                               mind, a risky return of 10 percent is equivalent to a risk-free return or a
                               guaranteed outcome of 4 percent.

     aversion coefficient of 2 choose?
        Solution:
        The utility for risk-averse investors with A = 4 and A = 2 for each of the four
        investments are shown in the following table. Complete calculations for
        Investment 1 with A = 4 are as follows: U = 0.12 − 0.5 × 4 × 0.302= –0.06.

        The risk-averse investor with a risk aversion coefficient of 4 should choose
        Investment 1. The risk-averse investor with a risk aversion coefficient of 2
        should choose Investment 3.

  2. Which investment will a risk-neutral investor choose?
        Solution:
        A risk-neutral investor cares only about return. In other words, his risk aver-
        sion coefficient is 0. Therefore, a risk-neutral investor will choose Invest-
        ment 4 because it has the highest return.

  3. Which investment will a risk-loving investor choose?
        Solution:
        A risk-loving investor likes both higher risk and higher return. In other
        words, his risk aversion coefficient is negative. Therefore, a risk-loving inves-
        tor will choose Investment 4 because it has the highest return and highest
        risk among the four investments.

             6           APPLICATION OF UTILITY THEORY TO PORTFOLIO
                         SELECTION

                                               explain risk aversion and its implications for portfolio selection
                                               explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s
                                               utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line

                         The simplest application of utility theory and risk aversion is to a portfolio of two
                         assets, a risk-free asset and a risky asset. The risk-free asset has zero risk and a return
                         of Rf. The risky asset has a risk of σi (> 0) and an expected return of E(Ri). Because
                         the risky asset has risk that is greater than that of the risk-free asset, the expected
                         return from the risky asset will be greater than the return from the risk-free asset,
                         that is, E(Ri) > Rf.
                             We can construct a portfolio of these two assets with a portfolio expected return,
                         E(Rp), and portfolio risk, σp, based on the formulas provided below. In the equations
                         given below, w1 is the weight in the risk-free asset and (1 − w1) is the weight in the risky
                         asset. Because σf = 0 for the risk-free asset, the first and third terms in the formula for
                         variance are zero leaving only the second term. We arrive at the last equation by taking
                         the square root of both sides, which shows the expression for standard deviation for
                         a portfolio of two assets when one asset is the risk-free asset:
                             E​(​Rp​ ​)​ = ​w​1​R
                                                ​ f​​+ (​ 1 − ​w​1​)​E(​ ​Ri​​)​
                             	​ ​P2​ = ​w​12​σ​ ​f2​​+ (​ 1 − ​w​1​)​2​​σ​i2​​+ 2 w
                           ​σ   
                                                                                  ​​ ​1​(1 − ​w​1​)​​ρ​12​​σ​f​​σ​i​ = (​ 1 − ​w​1​)​2​​σ​i2​​​
                           ​σ​p​ = (​ 1 − ​w​1​)​σ​ ​i​

                         The two-asset portfolio is drawn in Exhibit 9 by varying w1 from 0 percent to 100
                         percent. The portfolio standard deviation is on the horizontal axis and the portfolio
                         return is on the vertical axis. If only these two assets are available in the economy and
                         the risky asset represents the market, the line in Exhibit 9 is called the capital allo-
                         cation line. The capital allocation line represents the portfolios available to an investor.
                         The equation for this line can be derived from the above two equations by rewriting
                                                               ​σp​ ​
                         the second equation as w  ​ ​1​ = 1 − _
                                                               ​​σ​​​. Substituting the value of w1 in the equation for
                                                                                      i
                         expected return, we get the following equation for the capital allocation line:

                             	​E(​ ​Rp​ ​)​ = (   ​​σ​i​​)​​Rf​​+ _
                                                          ​σ​p​         ​σ​p​
                                              ​ 1−_                     ​ ​(​Ri​​)​
                                                                  ​​σ​i​E

                         This equation can be rewritten in a more usable form:
                                                     ​(E​(​Ri​)​ ​− ​Rf​​)​
                             	​E(​ ​Rp​ ​)​ = ​Rf​​+ _
                                                     ​       ​σ​i​        ​​σ​p​
                                                                                            ​(E​(​Ri​​)​− ​Rf​​)​
                         The capital allocation line has an intercept of Rf, and a slope of _
                                                                                            ​       ​σ​​        ​, which is

Because the equation is linear, the plot of the capital allocation line is a straight line.
The line begins with the risk-free asset as the leftmost point with zero risk and a
risk-free return, Rf. At that point, the portfolio consists of only the risk-free asset. If
100 percent is invested in the portfolio of all risky assets, however, we have a return
of E(Ri) with a risk of σi.
    We can move further along the line in pursuit of higher returns by borrowing at the
risk-free rate and investing the borrowed money in the portfolio of all risky assets. If 50
percent is borrowed at the risk-free rate, then w1 = –0.50 and 150 percent is placed in
the risky asset, giving a return = 1.50E(Ri) − 0.50Rf, which is > E(Ri) because E(Ri) > Rf.
    The line plotted in Exhibit 9 is comprised of an unlimited number of risk–return
pairs or portfolios. Which one of these portfolios should be chosen by an investor?
The answer lies in combining indifference curves from utility theory with the capital
allocation line from portfolio theory. Utility theory gives us the utility function or
the indifference curves for an individual, as in Exhibit 9, and the capital allocation
line gives us the set of feasible investments. Overlaying each individual’s indifference
curves on the capital allocation line will provide us with the optimal portfolio for that
investor. Exhibit 10 illustrates this process of portfolio selection.

                         The capital allocation line consists of the set of feasible portfolios. Points under the
                         capital allocation line may be attainable but are not preferred by any investor because
                         the investor can get a higher return for the same risk by moving up to the capital
                         allocation line. Points above the capital allocation line are desirable but not achievable
                         with available assets.
                              Three indifference curves for the same individual are also shown in Exhibit 10.
                         Curve 1 is above the capital allocation line, Curve 2 is tangential to the line, and
                         Curve 3 intersects the line at two points. Curve 1 has the highest utility and Curve
                         3 has the lowest utility. Because Curve 1 lies completely above the capital allocation
                         line, points on Curve 1 are not achievable with the available assets on the capital
                         allocation line. Curve 3 intersects the capital allocation line at two Points, a and b.
                         The investor is able to invest at either Point a or b to derive the risk–return trade-off
                         and utility associated with Curve 3. Comparing points with the same risk, observe
                         that Point n on Curve 3 has the same risk as Point m on Curve 2, yet Point m has the
                         higher expected return. Therefore, all investors will choose Curve 2 instead of Curve
                         3. Curve 2 is tangential to the capital allocation line at Point m. Point m is on the
                         capital allocation line and investable. Point m and the utility associated with Curve
                         2 is the best that the investor can do because he/she cannot move to a higher utility
                         indifference curve. Thus, we have been able to select the optimal portfolio for the
                         investor with indifference Curves 1, 2, and 3. Point m, the optimal portfolio for one
                         investor, may not be optimal for another investor. We can follow the same process,
                         however, for finding the optimal portfolio for other investors: the optimal portfolio is
                         the point of tangency between the capital allocation line and the indifference curve for
                         that investor. In other words, the optimal portfolio maximizes the return per unit of
                         risk (as it is on the capital allocation line), and it simultaneously supplies the investor
                         with the most satisfaction (utility).
                              As an illustration, Exhibit 11 shows two indifference curves for two different inves-
                         tors: Kelly with a risk aversion coefficient of 2 and Jane with a risk aversion coefficient
                         of 4. The indifference curve for Kelly is to the right of the indifference curve for Jane
                         because Kelly is less risk averse than Jane and can accept a higher amount of risk,
                         i.e. has a higher tolerance for risk. Accordingly, their optimal portfolios are different:

Point k is the optimal portfolio for Kelly and Point j is the optimal portfolio for Jane.
In addition, for the same return, the slope of Jane’s curve is higher than Kelly’s sug-
gesting that Jane needs greater incremental return as compensation for accepting an
additional amount of risk compared with Kelly.

We have seen before that investors are risk averse and demand a higher return for a
riskier investment. Therefore, ways of controlling portfolio risk without affecting return
are valuable. As a precursor to managing risk, this section explains and analyzes the
components of portfolio risk. In particular, it examines and describes how a portfolio
consisting of assets with low correlations have the potential of reducing risk without
necessarily reducing return.


Portfolio of Two Risky Assets
The return and risk of a portfolio of two assets was introduced in Sections 2–3 of this
reading. In this section, we briefly review the computation of return and extend the
concept of portfolio risk and its components.

22   Learning Module 1                                                        Portfolio Risk and Return: Part I


                         Portfolio Return
                         When several individual assets are combined into a portfolio, we can compute the
                         portfolio return as a weighted average of the returns in the portfolio. The portfolio
                         return is simply a weighted average of the returns of the individual investments, or
                         assets. If Asset 1 has a return of 20 percent and constitutes 25 percent of the portfo-
                         lio’s investment, then the contribution to the portfolio return is 5 percent (= 25% of
                         20%). In general, if Asset i has a return of Ri and has a weight of wi in the portfolio,
                         then the portfolio return, RP, is given as:
                                         N                N
                             	​RP​ ​ = ∑      ​ i​​,    ​∑​w​i​ = 1​
                                       ​ ​w​i​R
                                        i=1              i=1

                         Note that the weights must add up to 1 because the assets in a portfolio, including
                         cash, must account for 100 percent of the investment. Also, note that these are single
                         period returns, so there are no cash flows during the period and the weights remain
                         constant.
                             When two individual assets are combined in a portfolio, we can compute the port-
                         folio return as a weighted average of the returns of the two assets. Consider Assets
                         1 and 2 with weights of 25 percent and 75 percent in a portfolio. If their returns are
                         20 percent and 5 percent, the weighted average return = (0.25 × 20%) + (0.75 × 5%)
                         = 8.75%. More generally, the portfolio return can be written as below, where Rp is
                         return of the portfolio, w1 and w2 are the weights of the two assets, and R1, R2 are
                         returns on the two assets:
                                       ​ ​1​​R1​ ​+ (​ 1 − ​w​1​)​​R2​ ​
                             	​Rp​ ​ = w


                         Portfolio Risk
                         Like a portfolio’s return, we can calculate a portfolio’s variance. Although the return
                         of a portfolio is simply a weighted average of the returns of each security, this is not
                         the case with the standard deviation of a portfolio (unless all securities are perfectly
                         correlated—that is, correlation equals one). Variance can be expressed more generally
                         for N securities in a portfolio using the notation from the portfolio return calculation
                         above:
                              N
                             ​∑​w​i​ = 1​
                             i=1
                              	​           ​                              ​

                                                               ( i=1        )
                                                            N
                             ​σ​P2​ = Var​(​RP​ ​)​ = Var​ ​∑​w​i​R
                                                                  ​ i​​ ​

                         Note that the weights must add up to 1. The right side of the equation is the variance
                         of the weighted average returns of individual securities. Weight is a constant, but the
                         returns are variables whose variance is shown by Var(Ri). We can rewrite the equation
                         as shown next. Because the covariance of an asset with itself is the variance of the
                         asset, we can separate the variances from the covariances in the second equation:
                                         N
                             ​σ​P2​ = ​∑ w    ​ ​j​Cov​(​Ri​​, R
                                         ​ ​i​w                ​ j​​)​
                                       i,j=1

                                     N                      N
                                                              ​                           ​
                            ​σ​P​ = ​∑​w​i​​Var​(​Ri​​)​+ ​ ∑ ​w​i​​w​j​Cov​(​Ri​​, ​Rj​​)​
                                2        2
                                      i=1                       i,j=1,i≠j

                         Cov(Ri,Rj) is the covariance of returns, Ri and Rj, and can be expressed as the product
                         of the correlation between the two returns (ρ1,2) and the standard deviations of the
                         two assets. Thus, Cov(Ri,Rj) = ρijσiσj.
                             For a two asset portfolio, the expression for portfolio variance simplifies to the
                         following using covariance and then using correlation:

      Return and Risk of a Two-Asset Portfolio

      1. Assume that as a US investor, you decide to hold a portfolio with 80 percent
         invested in the S&P 500 US stock index and the remaining 20 percent in
         the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The expected return is 9.93 percent for
         the S&P 500 and 18.20 percent for the Emerging Markets index. The risk
         (standard deviation) is 16.21 percent for the S&P 500 and 33.11 percent for
         the Emerging Markets index. What will be the portfolio’s expected return
         and risk given that the covariance between the S&P 500 and the Emerging
         Markets index is 0.5 percent or 0.0050? Note that units for covariance and
         variance are written as %2 when not expressed as a fraction. These are units
         of measure like squared feet and the numbers themselves are not actually
         squared.
           Solution:
            Portfolio return, RP = w1R1 + (1 − w1), R2 = (0.80 × 0.0993) + (0.20 × 0.1820)
            = 0.1158
            = 11.58%.

           The portfolio’s expected return is 11.58 percent and the portfolio’s risk is
           15.10 percent. Look at this example closely. It shows that we can take the
           portfolio of a US investor invested only in the S&P 500, combine it with a
           riskier portfolio consisting of emerging markets securities, and the return of
           the US investor increases from 9.93 percent to 11.58 percent while the risk
           of the portfolio actually falls from 16.21 percent to 15.10 percent. Exhibit 12
           depicts how the combination of the two assets results in a superior risk–re-
           turn trade-off. Not only does the investor get a higher return, but he also
           gets it at a lower risk. That is the power of diversification as you will see later
           in this reading.

                         Covariance and Correlation
                         The covariance in the formula for portfolio standard deviation can be expanded as
                         Cov(R1,R2) = ρ12σ1σ2 where ρ12 is the correlation between returns, R1, R2. Although
                         covariance is important, it is difficult to interpret because it is unbounded on both
                         sides. It is easier to understand the correlation coefficient (ρ12), which is bounded
                         but provides similar information.
                             Correlation is a measure of the consistency or tendency for two investments to
                         act in a similar way. The correlation coefficient, ρ12, can be positive or negative and
                         ranges from –1 to +1. Consider three different values of the correlation coefficient:
                             ■              ρ12 = +1: Returns of the two assets are perfectly positively correlated. Assets
                                            1 and 2 move together 100 percent of the time.
                             ■              ρ12 = –1: Returns of the two assets are perfectly negatively correlated. Assets
                                            1 and 2 move in opposite directions 100 percent of the time.
                             ■              ρ12 = 0: Returns of the two assets are uncorrelated. Movement of Asset 1
                                            provides no prediction regarding the movement of Asset 2.
                             The correlation coefficient between two assets determines the effect on portfolio
                         risk when the two assets are combined. To see how this works, consider two different
                         values of ρ12. You will find that portfolio risk is unaffected when the two assets are
                         perfectly correlated (ρ12 = +1). In other words, the portfolio’s standard deviation is
                         simply a weighted average of the standard deviations of the two assets and as such a
                         portfolio’s risk is unchanged with the addition of assets with the same risk parameters.
                         Portfolio risk falls, however, when the two assets are not perfectly correlated (ρ12 <
                         +1). Sufficiently low values of the correlation coefficient can make the portfolio riskless
                         under certain conditions.

                             First, let ρ12 = +1

The first set of terms on the right side of the first equation contain the usual terms
for portfolio variance. Because the correlation coefficient is equal to +1, the right
side can be rewritten as a perfect square. The third row shows that portfolio risk is a
weighted average of the risks of the individual assets’ risks. We showed earlier that
the portfolio return is a weighted average of the assets’ returns. Because both risk
and return are just weighted averages of the two assets in the portfolio there is no
reduction in risk when ρ12 = +1.

    Now let ρ12 < +1
    The above analysis showed that portfolio risk is a weighted average of asset risks
when ρ12 = + 1. When ρ12 < +1, the portfolio risk is less than the weighted average
of the individual assets’ risks.
    To show this, we begin by reproducing the general formula for portfolio risk, which
is expressed by the terms to the left of the “<” sign below. The term to the right of “<”
shows the portfolio risk when ρ12 = + 1:
                  ____________________________                                        _________________________

 ​σ​p​ < (​ ​w​1​​σ​1​+ w     ​ ​2​σ​ ​2​)​

The left side is smaller than the right side because the correlation coefficient on the
left side for the new portfolio is <1. Thus, the portfolio risk is less than the weighted
average of risks while the portfolio return is still a weighted average of returns.
    As you can see, we have achieved diversification by combining two assets that are
not perfectly correlated. For an extreme case in which ρ12 = –1 (that is, the two asset
returns move in opposite directions), the portfolio can be made risk free.

EXAMPLE 4

   Effect of Correlation on Portfolio Risk
   Two stocks have the same return and risk (standard deviation): 10 percent return
   with 20 percent risk. You form a portfolio with 50 percent each of Stock 1 and
   Stock 2 to examine the effect of correlation on risk.

   1. Calculate the portfolio return and risk if the correlation is 1.0.
        Solution:

     ​σ​p2​​ = ​w​12​σ​ ​12​ + ​w​22​σ​ ​22​ + 2 ​w​1​​w​2​σ​ ​1​σ​ ​2​​ρ​12​

     ​σ​p​ = √
             ​ 0.04 ​ = 0.20 = 20%

        This equation demonstrates the earlier point that with a correlation of 1.0
        the risk of the portfolio is the same as the risk of the individual assets.

                                than either of the assets individually.

                                Solution:

                                This equation demonstrates the earlier point that, if the correlation of assets
                                is low enough, in this case 100 percent negative correlation or –1.00 (exactly
                                inversely related), a portfolio can be designed that eliminates risk. The indi-
                                vidual assets retain their risk characteristics, but the portfolio is risk free.

                            4. Compare the return and risk of portfolios with different correlations.
                                Solution:
                                The expected return is 10 percent in all three cases; however, the returns
                                will be more volatile in Case 1 and least volatile in Case 3. In the first case,
                                there is no diversification of risk (same risk as before of 20 percent) and the
                                return remains the same. In the second case, with a correlation coefficient of
                                0, we have achieved diversification of risk (risk is now 14 percent instead of
                                20 percent), again with the same return. In the third case with a correlation
                                coefficient of –1, the portfolio is risk free, although we continue to get the
                                same return of 10 percent. This example shows the power of diversification
                                that we expand on further in Section 9.


                         Relationship between Portfolio Risk and Return
                         The previous example illustrated the effect of correlation on portfolio risk while keeping
                         the weights in the two assets equal and unchanged. In this section, we consider how
                         portfolio risk and return vary with different portfolio weights and different correlations.
                             Asset 1 has an annual return of 7 percent and annualized risk of 12 percent, whereas
                         Asset 2 has an annual return of 15 percent and annualized risk of 25 percent. The
                         relationship is tabulated in Exhibit 13 for the two assets and graphically represented
                         in Exhibit 14.

The table shows the portfolio return and risk for four correlation coefficients ranging
from +1.0 to –1.0 and 11 weights ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent. The portfolio
return and risk are 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively, when 0 percent is invested
in Asset 1, versus 7 percent and 12 percent when 100 percent is invested in Asset 1.
The portfolio return varies with weights but is unaffected by the correlation coefficient.

                             Portfolio risk becomes smaller with each successive decrease in the correlation
                         coefficient, with the smallest risk when ρ12 = –1. The graph in Exhibit 14 shows
                         that the risk–return relationship is a straight line when ρ12 = +1. As the correlation
                         falls, the risk becomes smaller and smaller as in the table. The curvilinear nature of
                         a portfolio of assets is recognizable in all investment opportunity sets (except at the
                         extremes where ρ12 = –1 or +1).

                            Assume you are a UK investor holding a portfolio invested 60% in UK large-cap-
                            italization equities (as proxied by the FTSE 100 Index) and 40% in local medi-
                            um-duration Treasury bonds (“gilts”). The expected return on the FTSE 100 is
                            5.5% and on the medium-duration gilts it is 0.7%. The risk (standard deviation
                            of returns) is 13.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The correlation between the two
                            assets is –0.01.
                                 The expected return of this portfolio is
                                Rp = w1 × R1 + (1 – w1) × R2 = 0.6 × 0.055 + 0.4 × 0.07 = 0.0358 ≈ 3.6%.

                                You notice that compared with US Treasury bonds, the expected return on
                            gilts is lower and the risk of gilts is higher. US Treasury bonds have an expected
                            return for a US-based investor of 1.5% and a risk of 4.0%. You wonder whether
                            replacing the gilts in your portfolio with US Treasury bonds (“Treasuries”) would
                            improve the risk and return profile of your portfolio.

                            1. Do the given risk and return assumptions for US Treasury bonds allow you
                               as a UK-based investor to calculate the expected return and risk of your
                               portfolio with US Treasury bonds replacing UK gilts?
                               Solution:
                               No. The expected return and risk for Treasuries apply to a US investor, who
                               invests in US dollars. To calculate expected return and risk in sterling for a
                               UK-based portfolio of FTSE 100 equities and US Treasuries, one needs to
                               take into account the exchange rate between the US dollar and UK pound
                               sterling. This exchange rate has a volatility (risk) of its own, and a return
                               expectation for the GBP/USD exchange rate has to be specified.
                               For the purpose of calculating the return and risk of a foreign asset in a
                               domestic investor’s portfolio, the foreign asset can be seen as a “portfolio”
                               of two assets. The return of a foreign asset in domestic (i.e., non-foreign)
                               currency can be decomposed into a local currency return component and
                               an exchange rate component:
                                RD = (1 + Rlc) × (1 + RFX) – 1
                               Because the portfolio is fully exposed to the movement in both the asset’s
                               value in local currency and the currency exchange rate, the foreign currency
                               and the asset each have a 100% portfolio weight. Note that the exchange

     Assume in what follows that the risk (measured as expected standard
     deviation) of the GBP/USD currency exchange rate is 9.0% and the returns
     on Treasuries have a correlation with the GBP/USD exchange rate of 0.33.
     Assume also that you have no forecast for the future value of the USD/GBP
     exchange rate, and hence assume a 0% return.

  3. What would be the expected return and risk for your portfolio if you replace
     the UK gilts with US Treasuries?
     Solution:
     The expected return is the weighted average of the expected returns in
     British pound sterling (GBP) of UK large-capitalization equities and of US
     Treasuries. Recall that the return of a foreign asset in domestic currency
     consists of a foreign currency component and an asset component. All ex-
     pected returns can be found above.
      Rp = w1 × R1 + (1 – w1) × [(1 + Rlc) × (1 + RFX) – 1].

      Rp = 0.6 × 0.055 + 0.4 × [(1 + 0.015) × (1 + 0.0) – 1] = 0.039 = 3.9%.
     Calculation of the risk of the portfolio involves a slightly more complicated
     formula. Recall that the risk of a two-asset portfolio depends on the risk
     and the weights of the individual assets and the co-movements between the
     two. For a three-asset portfolio (an equity portion, a foreign fixed-income
     portion, and the associated foreign currency exposure), the calculation is es-
     sentially the same, however there are three pairs of co-movements between
     assets, rather than one.
     The formula for the standard deviation of a three-asset portfolio is therefore

                                          folio with UK large-capitalization equities and US Treasuries as follows:
                                           σp = (0.62 × 0.1322 + 0.42 × 0.0402 + 0.42 × 0.0902 + 2 × –0.32 × 0.6 × 0.4 ×
                                           0.132 × 0.040 + 2 × –0.06 × 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.132 × 0.090 + 2 × 0.33 × 0.4 × 0.4 ×
                                           0.040 × 0.090)1⁄2.

                                           σp = 0.0841 ≈ 8.4%.
                                          Compared to the UK equity/gilt portfolio, the UK equity/US Treasury port-
                                          folio has a higher expected return, because the UK gilts were replaced with
                                          an asset with superior return expectations. The risk of the new portfolio,
                                          however, is slightly higher despite the lower risk in local currency terms of
                                          US Treasuries compared to gilts. Owning US Treasuries as a non-US inves-
                                          tor means being exposed to exchange rate risk, which should be considered
                                          when evaluating the risk profile.

                                                        describe the effect on a portfolio’s risk of investing in assets that are
                                                        less than perfectly correlated

                                In the previous section, we discussed how the correlation between two assets can
                                affect the risk of a portfolio and the smaller the correlation the lower is the risk. The
                                above analysis can be extended to a portfolio with many risky assets (N). Recall the
                                previous equations for portfolio return and variance:


                                                                                     ( i=1                                               ) i=1

                                                       ​ ​w​i​E​(​Ri​​)​,    ​σ​P2​ = ​ ​∑​w​i2​​​σ​i2​​+ ​ ∑ ​w​i​​w​j​Cov​(i, j)​ ​, ∑
                                      	​E(​ ​Rp​ ​)​ = ∑                                                                               ​ ​w​i​ = 1​
                                                        i=1                                               i,j=1,i≠j

                                To examine how a portfolio with many risky assets works and the ways in which we
                                can reduce the risk of a portfolio, assume that the portfolio has equal weights (1/N) for
                                                                        _
                                all N assets. In addition, assume that ​σ ​2​and ‾
                                                                                 ​Cov​are the average variance and average
                                covariance. Given equal weights and average variance/covariance, we can rewrite the
                                portfolio variance as below (intermediate steps are omitted to focus on the main result):


                                                 ( i=1                                        )​​
                                                        N                  N
                                        ​σ​P2​ = ​ ​∑​w​i2​​σ​ ​i2​​+ ​ ∑ ​w​i​​w​j​Cov​(i, j)​ ​
                                         
                                     	​                               i,j=1,i≠j
                                                _
                                                    ​ N ‾
                                               ​σ ​2​   (​ N − 1)​
                                     ​σ​P2​ = _
                                              ​N ​+ _   ​Cov​

                                The equation in the second line shows that as N becomes large, the first term on the
                                right side with the denominator of N becomes smaller and smaller, implying that the
                                contribution of one asset’s variance to portfolio variance gradually becomes negligible.
                                The second term, however, approaches the average covariance as N increases. It is
                                reasonable to say that for portfolios with a large number of assets, covariance among
                                the assets accounts for almost all of the portfolio’s risk.

Importance of Correlation in a Portfolio of Many Assets
The analysis becomes more instructive and interesting if we assume that all assets in
the portfolio have the same variance and the same correlation among assets. In that
case, the portfolio risk can then be rewritten as:
            _____________

           √ ​σ​ ​ ​ N − 1 ​
              2     (     )
   	​σ​p​ = ​ _
              ​N ​+ _
                    ​ N ​ρ ​σ​2​

The first term under the root sign becomes negligible as the number of assets in the
portfolio increases leaving the second term (correlation) as the main determining
factor for portfolio risk. If the assets are unrelated to one another, the portfolio can
have close to zero risk. In the next section, we review these concepts to learn how
portfolios can be diversified.




THE POWER OF DIVERSIFICATION
                                                                                              9

                  describe the effect on a portfolio’s risk of investing in assets that are
                  less than perfectly correlated

Diversification is one of the most important and powerful concepts in investments.
Because investors are risk averse, they are interested in reducing risk preferably without
reducing return. In other cases, investors may accept a lower return if it will reduce
the chance of catastrophic losses. In previous sections of this reading, you learned
the importance of correlation and covariance in managing risk. This section applies
those concepts to explore ways for risk diversification. We begin with a simple but
intuitive example.

EXAMPLE 6

   Diversification with Rain and Shine
   Assume a company Beachwear rents beach equipment. The annual return from
   the company’s operations is 20 percent in years with many sunny days but falls
   to 0 percent in rainy years with few sunny days. The probabilities of a sunny
   year and a rainy year are equal at 50 percent. Thus, the average return is 10
   percent, with a 50 percent chance of 20 percent return and a 50 percent chance
   of 0 percent return. Because Beachwear can earn a return of 20 percent or 0
   percent, its average return of 10 percent is risky.
       You are excited about investing in Beachwear but do not like the risk. Having
   heard about diversification, you decide to add another business to the portfolio
   to reduce your investment risk.
       ■  There is a snack shop on the beach that sells all the healthy food you
          like. You estimate that the annual return from the Snackshop is also 20
          percent in years with many sunny days and 0 percent in other years.
          As with the Beachwear shop, the average return is 10 percent.
      You decide to invest 50 percent each in Snackshop and Beachwear. The
   average return is still 10 percent, with 50 percent of 10 percent from Snackshop
   and 50 percent of 10 percent from Beachwear. In a sunny year, you would earn

                            20 percent (= 50% of 20% from Beachwear + 50% of 20% from Snackshop). In
                            a rainy year, you would earn 0 percent (=50% of 0% from Beachwear + 50% of

                            These results seem counterintuitive. You thought that by adding another business
                            you would be able to diversify and reduce your risk, but the risk is exactly the
                            same as before. What went wrong? Note that both businesses do well when it is
                            sunny and both businesses do poorly when it rains. The correlation between the
                            two businesses is +1.0. No reduction in risk occurs when the correlation is +1.0.
                                ■   To reduce risk, you must consider a business that does well in a rainy
                                    year. You find a company that rents DVDs. DVDrental company is
                                    similar to the Beachwear company, except that its annual return is 20
                                    percent in a rainy year and 0 percent in a sunny year, with an average
                                    return of 10 percent. DVDrental’s 10 percent return is also risky just
                                    like Beachwear’s return.
                                If you invest 50 percent each in DVDrental and Beachwear, then the aver-
                            age return is still 10 percent, with 50 percent of 10 percent from DVDrental
                            and 50 percent of 10 percent from Beachwear. In a sunny year, you would earn
                            10 percent (= 50% of 20% from Beachwear + 50% of 0% from DVDrental). In
                            a rainy year also, you would earn 10 percent (=50% of 0% from Beachwear +
                            50% of 20% from DVDrental). You have no risk because you earn 10 percent
                            in both sunny and rainy years. Thus, by adding DVDrental to Beachwear, you
                            have reduced (eliminated) your risk without affecting your return. The results
                            are tabulated in Exhibit 16.

   In this case, the two businesses have a correlation of –1.0. When two businesses
   with a correlation of –1.0 are combined, risk can always be reduced to zero.



Correlation and Risk Diversification
Correlation is the key in diversification of risk. Notice that the returns from Beachwear
and DVDrental always go in the opposite direction. If one of them does well, the
other does not. Therefore, adding assets that do not behave like other assets in your
portfolio is good and can reduce risk. The two companies in the above example have
a correlation of –1.0.
    Even when we expand the portfolio to many assets, correlation among assets
remains the primary determinant of portfolio risk. Lower correlations are associated
with lower risk. Unfortunately, most assets have high positive correlations. The chal-
lenge in diversifying risk is to find assets that have a correlation that is much lower
than +1.0.


Historical Risk and Correlation
When we previously discussed asset returns, we were careful to distinguish between
historical or past returns and expected or future returns because historical returns
may not be a good indicator of future returns. Returns may be highly positive in one
period and highly negative in another period depending on the risk of that asset.
Exhibit 1 showed that returns for large US company stocks were high in the 1990s
but were very low in the 2000s.
    Risk for an asset class, however, does not usually change dramatically from one
period to the next. Stocks have been risky even in periods of low returns. T-bills are
always less risky even when they earn high returns. From Exhibit 1, we can see that
risk has typically not varied much from one decade to the next, except that risk for
bonds has been much higher in recent decades when compared with earlier decades.
Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that historical risk can work as a good
proxy for future risk.
    As with risk, correlations are quite stable among assets of the same country.
Intercountry correlations, however, have been on the rise in the last few decades
as a result of globalization and the liberalization of many economies. A correlation
above 0.90 is considered high because the assets do not provide much opportunity
for diversification of risk Low correlations—generally less than 0.50—are desirable
for portfolio diversification.

                                      Historical Correlation among Asset Classes
                                      Correlations among major US asset classes and international stocks are reported in
                                      Exhibit 17 for 1970–2017. The highest correlation is between US large company stocks
                                      and US small company stocks at about 70 percent, whereas the correlation between US
                                      large company stocks and international stocks is approximately 66 percent. Although
                                      these are the highest correlations, they still provide diversification benefits because
                                      the correlations are less than 100 percent. The correlation between international
                                      stocks and US small company stocks is lower, at 50 percent. The lowest correlations
                                      are between stocks and bonds, with some correlations being negative, such as that
                                      between US small company stocks and US long-term government bonds. Similarly,
                                      the correlation between T-bills and stocks is close to zero.4

                                      The low correlations between stocks and bonds are attractive for portfolio diversi-
                                      fication. Similarly, including international securities in a portfolio can also control
                                      portfolio risk. It is not surprising that most diversified portfolios of investors contain
                                      domestic stocks, domestic bonds, foreign stocks, foreign bonds, real estate, cash, and
                                      other asset classes.


                                      Avenues for Diversification
                                      The reason for diversification is simple. By constructing a portfolio with assets that
                                      do not move together, you create a portfolio that reduces the ups and downs in the
                                      short term but continues to grow steadily in the long term. Diversification thus makes
                                      a portfolio more resilient to gyrations in financial markets.




                                      4 In any short period, T-bills are riskless and uncorrelated with other asset classes. For example, a 3-month
                                      US Treasury bill is redeemable at its face value upon maturity irrespective of what happens to other assets.
                                      When we consider multiple periods, however, returns on T-bills may be related to other asset classes
                                      because short-term interest rates vary depending on the strength of the economy and outlook for inflation.

The Power of Diversification                                                                              35


    We describe a number of approaches for diversification, some of which have been
discussed previously and some of which might seem too obvious. Diversification,
however, is such an important part of investing that it cannot be emphasized enough,
especially when we continue to meet and see many investors who are not properly
diversified.
    ■   Diversify with asset classes. Correlations among major asset classes5 are
        not usually high, as can be observed from the few US asset classes listed
        in Exhibit 17. Correlations for other asset classes and other countries are
        also typically low, which provides investors the opportunity to benefit from
        diversifying among many asset classes to achieve the biggest benefit from
        diversification. A partial list of asset classes includes domestic large caps,
        domestic small caps, growth stocks, value stocks, domestic corporate bonds,
        long-term domestic government bonds, domestic Treasury bills (cash),
        emerging market stocks, emerging market bonds, developed market stocks
        (i.e., developed markets excluding domestic market), developed market
        bonds, real estate, and gold and other commodities. In addition, industries
        and sectors are used to diversify portfolios. For example, energy stocks
        may not be well correlated with health care stocks. The exact proportions
        in which these assets should be included in a portfolio depend on the risk,
        return, and correlation characteristics of each and the home country of the
        investor.
    ■   Diversify with index funds. Diversifying among asset classes can become
        costly for small portfolios because of the number of securities required. For
        example, creating diversified exposure to a single category, such as a domes-
        tic large company asset class, may require a group of at least 30 stocks.
        Exposure to 10 asset classes may require 300 securities, which can be expen-
        sive to trade and track. Instead, it may be effective to use exchange-traded
        funds or mutual funds that track the respective indexes, which could
        bring down the costs associated with building a well-diversified portfolio.
        Therefore, many investors should consider index mutual funds as an invest-
        ment vehicle as opposed to individual securities.
    ■   Diversification among countries. Countries are different because of industry
        focus, economic policy, and political climate. The US economy produces
        many financial and technical services and invests a significant amount
        in innovative research. The Chinese and Indian economies, however, are
        focused on manufacturing. Countries in the European Union are vibrant
        democracies whereas East Asian countries are experimenting with democ-
        racy. Thus, financial returns in one country over time are not likely to be
        highly correlated with returns in another country. Country returns may also
        be different because of different currencies. In other words, the return on a
        foreign investment may be different when translated to the home country’s
        currency. Because currency returns are uncorrelated with stock returns,
        they may help reduce the risk of investing in a foreign country even when
        that country, in isolation, is a very risky emerging market from an equity
        investment point of view. Investment in foreign countries is an essential part
        of a well-diversified portfolio.
    ■   Diversify by not owning your employer’s stock. Companies encourage their
        employees to invest in company stock through employee stock plans and
        retirement plans. You should evaluate investing in your company, however,
        just as you would evaluate any other investment. In addition, you should
        consider the nonfinancial investments that you have made, especially the

                                 human capital you have invested in your company. Because you work
                                 for your employer, you are already heavily invested in it—your earnings
                                 depend on your employer. The level of your earnings, whether your com-
                                 pensation improves or whether you get a promotion, depends on how well
                                 your employer performs. If a competitor drives your employer out of the
                                 market, you will be out of a job. Additional investments in your employer
                                 will concentrate your wealth in one asset even more so and make you less
                                 diversified.
                             ■   Evaluate each asset before adding to a portfolio. Every time you add a secu-
                                 rity or an asset class to the portfolio, recognize that there is a cost associ-
                                 ated with diversification. There is a cost of trading an asset as well as the
                                 cost of tracking a larger portfolio. In some cases, the securities or assets may
                                 have different names but belong to an asset class in which you already have
                                 sufficient exposure. A general rule to evaluate whether a new asset should
                                 be included to an existing portfolio is based on the following risk–return
                                 trade-off relationship:
                                                   ​σ​new​​ρnew,p
                                                            ​     ​
                                     ​ ​)​ = ​Rf​​+ _
                             	​E(​ ​Rnew            ​ ​σ​p​ ​× ​[E​(​Rp​ ​)​− ​Rf​​]​

                                 where E(R) is the return from the asset, Rf is the return on the risk-free
                                 asset, σ is the standard deviation, ρ is the correlation coefficient, and the
                                 subscripts new and p refer to the new stock and existing portfolio. If the
                                 new asset’s risk-adjusted return benefits the portfolio, then the asset should
                                 be included. The condition can be rewritten using the Sharpe ratio on both
                                 sides of the equation as:

                             _ E​(​Rnew
                                    ​ ​)​− ​Rf​​ E​(​Rp​ ​)​− R
                                                              ​ f​​
                             	​ ​σ​new​ ​ > _    ​ ​σ​p​ ​× ​ρnew,p ​ ​

                                 If the Sharpe ratio of the new asset is greater than the Sharpe ratio of the
                                 current portfolio times the correlation coefficient, it is beneficial to add the
                                 new asset.
                             ■   Buy insurance for risky portfolios. It may come as a surprise, but insurance is
                                 an investment asset—just a different kind of asset. Insurance has a negative
                                 correlation with your assets and is thus very valuable. Insurance gives you a
                                 positive return when your assets lose value, but pays nothing if your assets
                                 maintain their value. Over time, insurance generates a negative average
                                 return. Many individuals, however, are willing to accept a small negative
                                 return because insurance reduces their exposure to an extreme loss. In
                                 general, it is reasonable to add an investment with a negative return if that
                                 investment significantly reduces risk (an example of a classic case of the
                                 risk–return trade-off ).
                                 Alternatively, investments with negative correlations also exist. Historically,
                                 gold has a negative correlation with stocks; however, the expected return
                                 is usually small and sometimes even negative. Investors often include gold
                                 and other commodities in their portfolios as a way of reducing their overall
                                 portfolio risk, including currency risk and inflation risk.
                                 Buying put options is another way of reducing risk. Because put options
                                 pay when the underlying asset falls in value (negative correlation), they can
                                 protect an investor’s portfolio against catastrophic losses. Of course, put
                                 options cost money, and the expected return is zero or marginally negative.

In this section, we formalize the effect of diversification and expand the set of invest-
ments to include all available risky assets in a mean–variance framework. The addition
of a risk-free asset generates an optimal risky portfolio and the capital allocation line.
We can then derive an investor’s optimal portfolio by overlaying the capital allocation
line with the indifference curves of investors.


Investment Opportunity Set
If two assets are perfectly correlated, the risk–return opportunity set is represented
by a straight line connecting those two assets. The line contains portfolios formed
by changing the weight of each asset invested in the portfolio. This correlation was
depicted by the straight line (with ρ = 1) in Exhibit 14. If the two assets are not per-
fectly correlated, the portfolio’s risk is less than the weighted average risk of the com-
ponents, and the portfolio formed from the two assets bulges on the left as shown by
curves with the correlation coefficient (ρ) less than 1.0 in Exhibit 14. All of the points
connecting the two assets are achievable (or feasible). The addition of new assets to
this portfolio creates more and more portfolios that are either a linear combination
of the existing portfolio and the new asset or a curvilinear combination, depending
on the correlation between the existing portfolio and the new asset.
    As the number of available assets increases, the number of possible combinations
increases rapidly. When all investable assets are considered, and there are hundreds
and thousands of them, we can construct an opportunity set of investments. The
opportunity set will ordinarily span all points within a frontier because it is also pos-
sible to reach every possible point within that curve by judiciously creating a portfolio
from the investable assets.
    We begin with individual investable assets and gradually form portfolios that can
be plotted to form a curve as shown in Exhibit 18. All points on the curve and points
to the right of the curve are attainable by a combination of one or more of the invest-
able assets. This set of points is called the investment opportunity set. Initially, the
opportunity set consists of domestic assets only and is labeled as such in Exhibit 18.

                         Addition of Asset Classes
                         Exhibit 18 shows the effect of adding a new asset class, such as international assets.
                         As long as the new asset class is not perfectly correlated with the existing asset class,
                         the investment opportunity set will expand out further to the northwest, providing a
                         superior risk–return trade-off.
                             The investment opportunity set with international assets dominates the opportunity
                         set that includes only domestic assets. Adding other asset classes will have the same
                         impact on the opportunity set. Thus, we should continue to add asset classes until
                         they do not further improve the risk–return trade-off. The benefits of diversification
                         can be fully captured in this way in the construction of the investment opportunity
                         set, and eventually in the selection of the optimal portfolio.
                             In the discussion that follows in this section, we will assume that all investable
                         assets available to an investor are included in the investment opportunity set and no
                         special attention needs to be paid to new asset classes or new investment opportunities.

                         Exhibit 19. There are a large number of portfolios available for investment, but we
                         must choose a single optimal portfolio. In this subsection, we begin the selection
                         process by narrowing the choice to fewer portfolios.

Minimum-Variance Frontier
Risk-averse investors seek to minimize risk for a given return. Consider Points A, B, and
X in Exhibit 19 and assume that they are on the same horizontal line by construction.
Thus, the three points have the same expected return, E(R1), as do all other points on
the imaginary line connecting A, B, and X. Given a choice, an investor will choose
the point with the minimum risk, which is Point X. Point X, however, is unattainable
because it does not lie within the investment opportunity set. Thus, the minimum risk
that we can attain for E(R1) is at Point A. Point B and all points to the right of Point
A are feasible but they have higher risk. Therefore, a risk-averse investor will choose
only Point A in preference to any other portfolio with the same return.
    Similarly, Point C is the minimum variance point for the return earned at C. Points
to the right of C have higher risk. We can extend the above analysis to all possible
returns. In all cases, we find that the minimum-variance portfolio is the one that lies
on the solid curve drawn in Exhibit 19. The entire collection of these minimum-variance
portfolios is referred to as the minimum-variance frontier. The minimum-variance
frontier defines the smaller set of portfolios in which investors would want to invest.
Note that no risk-averse investor will choose to invest in a portfolio to the right of
the minimum-variance frontier because a portfolio on the minimum-variance frontier
can give the same return but at a lower risk.

Global Minimum-Variance Portfolio
The left-most point on the minimum-variance frontier is the portfolio with the min-
imum variance among all portfolios of risky assets, and is referred to as the global
minimum-variance portfolio. An investor cannot hold a portfolio consisting of risky
assets that has less risk than that of the global minimum-variance portfolio. Note the
emphasis on “risky” assets. Later, the introduction of a risk-free asset will allow us
to relax this constraint.

                         Efficient Frontier of Risky Assets
                         The minimum-variance frontier gives us portfolios with the minimum variance for a
                         given return. However, investors also want to maximize return for a given risk. Observe
                         Points A and C on the minimum-variance frontier shown in Exhibit 19. Both of them
                         have the same risk. Given a choice, an investor will choose Portfolio A because it
                         has a higher return. No one will choose Portfolio C. The same analysis applies to all
                         points on the minimum-variance frontier that lie below the global minimum-variance
                         portfolio. Thus, portfolios on the curve below the global minimum-variance portfolio
                         and to the right of the global minimum-variance portfolio are not beneficial and are
                         inefficient portfolios for an investor.
                             The curve that lies above and to the right of the global minimum-variance portfolio
                         is referred to as the Markowitz efficient frontier because it contains all portfolios of
                         risky assets that rational, risk-averse investors will choose.
                             An important observation that is often ignored is the slope at various points on
                         the efficient frontier. As we move right from the global minimum-variance portfolio
                         (Point Z) in Exhibit 19, there is an increase in risk with a concurrent increase in return.
                         The increase in return with every unit increase in risk, however, keeps decreasing as
                         we move from left to the right because the slope continues to decrease. The slope at
                         Point D is less than the slope at Point A, which is less than the slope at Point Z. The
                         increase in return by moving from Point Z to Point A is the same as the increase in
                         return by moving from Point A to Point D. It can be seen that the additional risk in
                         moving from Point A to Point D is 3 to 4 times more than the additional risk in mov-
                         ing from Point Z to Point A. Thus, investors obtain decreasing increases in returns
                         as they assume more risk.

                                        explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s
                                        utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line

                         Until now, we have only considered risky assets in which the return is risky or uncertain.
                         Most investors, however, have access to a risk-free asset, most notably from securities
                         issued by the government. The addition of a risk-free asset makes the investment
                         opportunity set much richer than the investment opportunity set consisting only of
                         risky assets.


                         Capital Allocation Line and Optimal Risky Portfolio
                         By definition, a risk-free asset has zero risk so it must lie on the y-axis in a mean-variance
                         graph. A risk-free asset with a return of Rf is plotted in Exhibit 20. This asset can now
                         be combined with a portfolio of risky assets. The combination of a risk-free asset
                         with a portfolio of risky assets is a straight line, such as in Section 6 (see Exhibit 9).
                         Unlike in Section 6, however, we have many risky portfolios to choose from instead
                         of a single risky portfolio.

All portfolios on the efficient frontier are candidates for being combined with the
risk-free asset. Two combinations are shown in Exhibit 20: one between the risk-free
asset and efficient Portfolio A and the other between the risk-free asset and efficient
Portfolio P. Comparing capital allocation line A and capital allocation line P reveals
that there is a point on CAL(P) with a higher return and same risk for each point
on CAL(A). In other words, the portfolios on CAL(P) dominate the portfolios on
CAL(A). Therefore, an investor will choose CAL(P) over CAL(A). We would like to
move further northwest to achieve even better portfolios. None of those portfolios,
however, is attainable because they are above the efficient frontier.
    What about other points on the efficient frontier? For example, Point X is on the
efficient frontier and has the highest return of all risky portfolios for its risk. However,
Point Y on CAL(P), achievable by leveraging Portfolio P as seen in Section 6, lies above
Point X and has the same risk but higher return. In the same way, we can observe
that not only does CAL(P) dominate CAL(A) but it also dominates the Markowitz
efficient frontier of risky assets.
    CAL(P) is the optimal capital allocation line and Portfolio P is the optimal risky
portfolio. Thus, with the addition of the risk-free asset, we are able to narrow our
selection of risky portfolios to a single optimal risky portfolio, P, which is at the tan-
gent of CAL(P) and the efficient frontier of risky assets.


The Two-Fund Separation Theorem
The two-fund separation theorem states that all investors regardless of taste, risk
preferences, and initial wealth will hold a combination of two portfolios or funds: a
risk-free asset and an optimal portfolio of risky assets.6
    The separation theorem allows us to divide an investor’s investment problem into
two distinct steps: the investment decision and the financing decision. In the first
step, as in the previous analysis, the investor identifies the optimal risky portfolio. The
optimal risky portfolio is selected from numerous risky portfolios without considering
the investor’s preferences. The investment decision at this step is based on the optimal
risky portfolio’s (a single portfolio) return, risk, and correlations.


6 In the next reading, you will learn that the optimal portfolio of risky assets is the market portfolio.

                             The capital allocation line connects the optimal risky portfolio and the risk-free
                         asset. All optimal investor portfolios must be on this line. Each investor’s optimal
                         portfolio on the CAL(P) is determined in the second step. Considering each individual
                         investor’s risk preference, using indifference curves, determines the investor’s allocation
                         to the risk-free asset (lending) and to the optimal risky portfolio. Portfolios beyond the
                         optimal risky portfolio are obtained by borrowing at the risk-free rate (i.e., buying on
                         margin). Therefore, the individual investor’s risk preference determines the amount
                         of financing (i.e., lending to the government instead of investing in the optimal risky
                         portfolio or borrowing to purchase additional amounts of the optimal risky portfolio).

                               Answer the following questions with reference to the points plotted on
                            Exhibit 21 and explain your answers. The investor is choosing one portfolio
                            based on the graph.

                            1. Which of the above points is not achievable?
                                 Solution:
                                 Portfolio A is not attainable because it lies outside the feasible set and not
                                 on the capital allocation line.

   2. Which of these portfolios will not be chosen by a rational, risk-averse
      investor?
      Solution:
      Portfolios G and C will not be chosen because D provides higher return for
      the same risk. G and C are the only investable points that do not lie on the
      capital allocation line.

   3. Which of these portfolios is most suitable for a risk-neutral investor?
      Solution:
      Portfolio D is most suitable because a risk-neutral investor cares only about
      return and portfolio D provides the highest return. A = 0 in the utility
      formula.

   4. Gold is on the inefficient part of the feasible set. Nonetheless, gold is owned
      by many rational investors as part of a larger portfolio. Why?
      Solution:
      Gold may be owned as part of a portfolio (not as the portfolio) because gold
      has low or negative correlation with many risky assets, such as stocks. Being
      part of a portfolio can thus reduce overall risk even though its standalone
      risk is high and return is low. Note that gold’s price is not stable—its return
      is very risky (30 percent). Even risk seekers will choose D over G, which has
      the same risk but higher return.

   5. What is the utility of an investor at point P with a risk aversion coefficient of
      3?
      Solution:
      U = E(r) − 0.5Aσ2 = 0.16 − 0.5 × 3 × 0.0289 = 0.1167 = 11.67%.




EFFICIENT FRONTIER: OPTIMAL INVESTOR
PORTFOLIO                                                                                    12
              explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s
              utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line

The CAL(P) in Exhibit 22 contains the best possible portfolios available to investors.
Each of those portfolios is a linear combination of the risk-free asset and the optimal
risky portfolio. Among the available portfolios, the selection of each investor’s optimal
portfolio depends on the risk preferences of an investor. In Sections 4–6, we discussed
that the individual investor’s risk preferences are incorporated into their indifference
curves. These can be used to select the optimal portfolio.
     Exhibit 22 shows an indifference curve that is tangent to the capital allocation
line, CAL(P). Indifference curves with higher utility than this one lie above the cap-
ital allocation line, so their portfolios are not achievable. Indifference curves that lie
below this one are not preferred because they have lower utility. Thus, the optimal
portfolio for the investor with this indifference curve is portfolio C on CAL(P), which
is tangent to the indifference curve.

                          EXAMPLE 8

                            Comprehensive Example on Portfolio Selection
                            This comprehensive example reviews many concepts learned in this reading.
                            The example begins with simple information about available assets and builds
                            an optimal investor portfolio for the Lohrmanns.
                               Suppose the Lohrmanns can invest in only two risky assets, A and B. The
                            expected return and standard deviation for asset A are 20 percent and 50 percent,
                            and the expected return and standard deviation for asset B are 15 percent and
                            33 percent. The two assets have zero correlation with one another.

                            1. Calculate portfolio expected return and portfolio risk (standard deviation) if
                               an investor invests 10 percent in A and the remaining 90 percent in B.
                                           Solution:
                                           The subscript “rp” means risky portfolio.

  3. Now introduce a risk-free asset with a return of 3 percent. Write an equa-
     tion for the capital allocation line in terms of wA that will connect the risk-
     free asset to the portfolio of risky assets. (Hint: use the equation in Section
     6 and substitute the expressions for a risky portfolio’s risk and return from
     Part 2 above).
        Solution:
        The equation of the line connecting the risk-free asset to the portfolio of
        risky assets is given below (see Section 6), where the subscript “rp” refers
        to the risky portfolio instead of “i,” and the subscript “p” refers to the new
        portfolio of two risky assets and one risk-free asset.

        The capital allocation line is the line that has the maximum slope because it
        is tangent to the curve formed by portfolios of the two risky assets. Exhibit
        24 shows the capital allocation line based on a risk-free asset added to the
        group of assets.

                             4. The slope of the capital allocation line is maximized when the weight in
                                Asset A is 38.20 percent.7 What is the equation for the capital allocation line
                                using wA of 38.20 percent?
                                   Solution:
                                   By substituting 38.20 percent for wA in the equation in Part 3, we get E(Rp) =
                                   0.03 + 0.4978σp as the capital allocation line.

                             5. Having created the capital allocation line, we turn to the Lohrmanns. What
                                is the standard deviation of a portfolio that gives a 20 percent return and is
                                on the capital allocation line? How does this portfolio compare with asset A?
                                   Solution:
                                   Solve the equation for the capital allocation line to get the standard devi-
                                   ation: 0.20 = 0.03 + 0.4978σp. σp = 34.2%. The portfolio with a 20 percent
                                   return has the same return as Asset A but a lower standard deviation, 34.2
                                   percent instead of 50.0 percent.

                             6. What is the risk of portfolios with returns of 3 percent, 9 percent, 15 per-
                                cent, and 20 percent?
                                   Solution:
                                   You can find the risk of the portfolio using the equation for the capital allo-
                                   cation line: E(Rp) = 0.03 + 0.4978σp.
                                   For a portfolio with a return of 15 percent, write 0.15 = 0.03 + 0.4978σp.
                                   Solving for σp gives 24.1 percent. You can similarly calculate risks of other
                                   portfolios with the given returns.
                                   The risk of the portfolio for a return of 3 percent is 0.0 percent, for a return
                                   of 9 percent is 12.1 percent, for a return of 15 percent is 24.1 percent, and
                                   for a return of 20 percent is 34.2 percent. The points are plotted in Exhibit
                                   25.

  7. What is the utility that the Lohrmanns derive from a portfolio with a return
     of 3 percent, 9 percent, 15 percent, and 20 percent? The risk aversion coeffi-
     cient for the Lohrmanns is 2.5.
        Solution:
        To find the utility, use the utility formula with a risk aversion coefficient of
        2.5:

                 Utility = E​(​Rp​ ​)​− 0.5 × 2.5 ​σ​p2​​
        Utility ​(3%)​ = 0.0300
             
             
          
           
        	​
        Utility ​(9%)​ = 0.09 − ​0.5 × 2.5​ × ​0.121​2​ = + 0.0717​ ​​
           Utility ​(15%)​ = 0.15 − 0.5 × 2.5 × ​0.241​2​ = + 0.0774
        Utility ​(20%)​ = 0.20 − 0.5 × 2.5 × 0​ .341​2​ = + 0.0546
        Based on the above information, the Lohrmanns choose a portfolio with a
        return of 15 percent and a standard deviation of 24.1 percent because it has
        the highest utility: 0.0774. Finally, Exhibit 26 shows the indifference curve
        that is tangent to the capital allocation line to generate Lohrmanns’ optimal
        investor portfolio.

                         Investor Preferences and Optimal Portfolios
                         The location of an optimal investor portfolio depends on the investor’s risk prefer-
                         ences. A highly risk-averse investor may invest a large proportion, even 100 percent,
                         of his/her assets in the risk-free asset. The optimal portfolio in this investor’s case
                         will be located close to the y-axis. A less risk-averse investor, however, may invest a
                         large portion of his/her wealth in the optimal risky asset. The optimal portfolio in
                         this investor’s case will lie closer to Point P in Exhibit 22.
                             Some less risk-averse investors (i.e., with a high risk tolerance) may wish to accept
                         even more risk because of the chance of higher return. Such an investor may borrow
                         money to invest more in the risky portfolio. If the investor borrows 25 percent of
                         his wealth, he/she can invest 125 percent in the optimal risky portfolio. The optimal
                         investor portfolio for such an investor will lie to the right of Point P on the capital
                         allocation line.
                             Thus, moving from the risk-free asset along the capital allocation line, we encounter
                         investors who are willing to accept more risk. At Point P, the investor is 100 percent
                         invested in the optimal risky portfolio. Beyond Point P, the investor accepts even more
                         risk by borrowing money and investing in the optimal risky portfolio.
                             Note that we are able to accommodate all types of investors with just two portfolios:
                         the risk-free asset and the optimal risky portfolio. Exhibit 22 is also an illustration
                         of the two-fund separation theorem. Portfolio P is the optimal risky portfolio that
                         is selected without regard to investor preferences. The optimal investor portfolio
                         is selected on the capital allocation line by overlaying the indifference curves that
                         incorporate investor preferences.




                            SUMMARY
                         This reading provides a description and computation of investment characteristics,
                         such as risk and return, that investors use in evaluating assets for investment. This
                         was followed by sections about portfolio construction, selection of an optimal risky
                         portfolio, and an understanding of risk aversion and indifference curves. Finally,
                         the tangency point of the indifference curves with the capital allocation line allows
                         identification of the optimal investor portfolio. Key concepts covered in the reading
                         include the following:
                             ■   Holding period return is most appropriate for a single, predefined holding
                                 period.
                             ■   Multiperiod returns can be aggregated in many ways. Each return computa-
                                 tion has special applications for evaluating investments.
                             ■   Risk-averse investors make investment decisions based on the risk–return
                                 trade-off, maximizing return for the same risk, and minimizing risk for the
                                 same return. They may be concerned, however, by deviations from a normal
                                 return distribution and from assumptions of financial markets’ operational
                                 efficiency.
                             ■   Investors are risk averse, and historical data confirm that financial markets
                                 price assets for risk-averse investors.
                             ■   The risk of a two-asset portfolio is dependent on the proportions of each
                                 asset, their standard deviations and the correlation (or covariance) between
                                 the assets’ returns. As the number of assets in a portfolio increases, the
                                 correlation among asset risks becomes a more important determinant of
                                 portfolio risk.

   ■   Combining assets with low correlations reduces portfolio risk.
   ■   The two-fund separation theorem allows us to separate decision making into
       two steps. In the first step, the optimal risky portfolio and the capital allo-
       cation line are identified, which are the same for all investors. In the second
       step, investor risk preferences enable us to find a unique optimal investor
       portfolio for each investor.
   ■   The addition of a risk-free asset creates portfolios that are dominant to port-
       folios of risky assets in all cases except for the optimal risky portfolio.
    By successfully understanding the content of this reading, you should be comfort-
able calculating an investor’s optimal portfolio given the investor’s risk preferences
and universe of investable assets available.

                         24. The correlation between assets in a two-asset portfolio increases during a market
                             decline. If there is no change in the proportion of each asset held in the portfolio
                             or the expected standard deviation of the individual assets, the volatility of the
                             portfolio is most likely to:

                             A. highest expected return for a given level of risk.

                             B. lowest amount of risk for a given level of return.

                             C. highest expected return relative to the risk-free rate.

                             portfolios below the global minimum-variance portfolio is the:
                             A. capital allocation line.

                             line has higher rates of return for levels of risk greater than the optimal risky
                             portfolio because of the investor’s ability to:
                             A. lend at the risk-free rate.

                             SOLUTIONS
                         1. C is correct. Brokerage commissions are negotiated with the brokerage firm. A
                            security’s liquidity impacts the operational efficiency of trading costs. Specifically,
                            liquidity impacts the bid–ask spread and can impact the stock price (if the ability
                            to sell the stock is impaired by the uncertainty associated with being able to sell
                            the stock).

                         2. C is correct. Historical data over long periods of time indicate that there exists
                            a positive risk–return relationship, which is a reflection of an investor’s risk
                            aversion.

                         3. A is correct. A risk-free asset has a variance of zero and is not dependent on
                            whether the investor is risk neutral, risk seeking or risk averse. That is, given that
                            the utility function of an investment is expressed as ​U = E​(r)​− ​_21 ​A ​σ​2​, where A is
                             the measure of risk aversion, then the sign of A is irrelevant if the variance is zero
                             (like that of a risk-free asset).

                         4. C is correct. The most risk-averse investor has the indifference curve with the
                            greatest slope.

                         5. A is correct. A negative value in the given utility function indicates that the inves-
                            tor is a risk seeker.

                         6. C is correct. Investment 3 has the highest rate of return. Risk is irrelevant to a
                            risk-neutral investor, who would have a measure of risk aversion equal to 0. Given
                            the utility function, the risk-neutral investor would obtain the greatest amount of
                            utility from Investment 3.

10. A is correct. The CAL is the combination of the risk-free asset with zero risk and
    the portfolio of all risky assets that provides for the set of feasible investments.
    Allowing for borrowing at the risk-free rate and investing in the portfolio of all
    risky assets provides for attainable portfolios that dominate risky assets below the
    CAL.

11. B is correct. The CAL represents the set of all feasible investments. Each inves-
    tor’s indifference curve determines the optimal combination of the risk-free asset
    and the portfolio of all risky assets, which must lie on the CAL.

12. A is correct. The asset’s returns are not used to calculate the portfolio’s variance
    [only the assets’ weights, standard deviations (or variances), and covariances (or
    correlations) are used].

13. C is correct.

                         20. C is correct. An equally weighted portfolio of Asset 2 and Asset 3 will have the
                             lowest portfolio standard deviation, because for each outcome, the portfolio has
                             the same expected return (they are perfectly negatively correlated).

                         21. A is correct. An equally weighted portfolio of Asset 1 and Asset 2 has the highest
                             level of volatility of the three pairs. All three pairs have the same expected return;
                             however, the portfolio of Asset 1 and Asset 2 provides the least amount of risk

                         22. B is correct. The contribution of each individual asset’s variance (or standard
                             deviation) to the portfolio’s volatility decreases as the number of assets in the
                             equally weighted portfolio increases. The contribution of the co-movement
                             measures between the assets increases (i.e., covariance and correlation) as the
                             number of assets in the equally weighted portfolio increases. The following
                             equation    _ 2 for the variance _of     an equally weighted portfolio illustrates these points:

                         23. C is correct. The co-movement measures between the assets increases (i.e., co-
                             variance and correlation) as the number of assets in the equally weighted port-
                             folio increases. The contribution of each individual asset’s variance (or standard
                             deviation) to the portfolio’s volatility decreases as the number of assets in the
                             equally weighted portfolio increases. The following equation for the variance of
                             an equally weighted portfolio illustrates these points:

                         24. A is correct. Higher correlations will produce less diversification benefits provid-
                             ed that the other components of the portfolio standard deviation do not change
                             (i.e., the weights and standard deviations of the individual assets).

                         25. C is correct. The efficient frontier does not account for the risk-free rate. The
                             efficient frontier is the set of all attainable risky assets with the highest expected
                             return for a given level of risk or the lowest amount of risk for a given level of
                             return.

                         26. C is correct. The global minimum-variance portfolio is the portfolio on the
                             minimum-variance frontier with the lowest standard deviation. Although

   the portfolio is attainable, when the risk-free asset is considered, the global
   minimum-variance portfolio is not the optimal risky portfolio.

27. B is correct. The Markowitz efficient frontier has higher rates of return for a giv-

    efficient frontier is the set of portfolios above the global minimum-variance port-
    folio that dominates the portfolios below the global minimum-variance portfolio.

28. A is correct. The use of leverage and the combination of a risk-free asset and the
    optimal risky asset will dominate the efficient frontier of risky assets (the Mar-
    kowitz efficient frontier).

29. B is correct. The CAL dominates the efficient frontier at all points except for
    the optimal risky portfolio. The ability of the investor to purchase additional
    amounts of the optimal risky portfolio by borrowing (i.e., buying on margin) at
    the risk-free rate makes higher rates of return for levels of risk greater than the
    optimal risky asset possible.

30. C is correct. Each individual investor’s optimal mix of the risk-free asset and the
    optimal risky asset is determined by the investor’s risk preference.

INTRODUCTION
Our objective in this reading is to identify the optimal risky portfolio for all investors
                                                                                               1
by using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The foundation of this reading is
the computation of risk and return of a portfolio and the role that correlation plays
in diversifying portfolio risk and arriving at the efficient frontier. The efficient fron-
tier and the capital allocation line consist of portfolios that are generally acceptable
to all investors. By combining an investor’s individual indifference curves with the
market-determined capital allocation line, we are able to illustrate that the only opti-
mal risky portfolio for an investor is the portfolio of all risky assets (i.e., the market).

                             Additionally, we discuss the capital market line, a special case of the capital allo-
                         cation line that is used for passive investor portfolios. We also differentiate between
                         systematic and nonsystematic risk, and explain why investors are compensated for
                         bearing systematic risk but receive no compensation for bearing nonsystematic risk.
                         We discuss in detail the CAPM, which is a simple model for estimating asset returns
                         based only on the asset’s systematic risk. Finally, we illustrate how the CAPM allows
                         security selection to build an optimal portfolio for an investor by changing the asset
                         mix beyond a passive market portfolio.
                             The reading is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the consequences of
                         combining a risk-free asset with the market portfolio and provide an interpretation
                         of the capital market line. Section 3 decomposes total risk into systematic and non-
                         systematic risk and discusses the characteristics of and differences between the two
                         kinds of risk. We also introduce return-generating models, including the single-index
                         model, and illustrate the calculation of beta. In Section 4, we introduce the capital
                         asset pricing model and the security market line. Our focus on the CAPM does not
                         suggest that the CAPM is the only viable asset pricing model. Although the CAPM
                         is an excellent starting point, more advanced readings expand on these discussions
                         and extend the analysis to other models that account for multiple explanatory factors.
                         Section 5 covers several post-CAPM developments in theory. Section 6 covers mea-
                         sures for evaluating the performance of a portfolio which take account of risk. Section
                         7 covers some applications of the CAPM in portfolio construction. A summary and
                         practice problems conclude the reading.

                         ASSETS

                         You have learned how to combine a risk-free asset with one risky asset and with many
                         risky assets to create a capital allocation line. In this section, we will expand our dis-
                         cussion of multiple risky assets and consider a special case of the capital allocation
                         line, called the capital market line. While discussing the capital market line, we will
                         define the market and its role in passive portfolio management. Using these concepts,
                         we will illustrate how leveraged portfolios can enhance both risk and return.


                         Portfolio of Risk-Free and Risky Assets
                         Although investors desire an asset that produces the highest return and carries the
                         lowest risk, such an asset does not exist. As the risk–return capital market theory
                         illustrates, one must assume higher risk in order to earn a higher return. We can
                         improve an investor’s portfolio, however, by expanding the opportunity set of risky
                         assets because this allows the investor to choose a superior mix of assets.
                             Similarly, an investor’s portfolio improves if a risk-free asset is added to the mix.
                         In other words, a combination of the risk-free asset and a risky asset can result in a
                         better risk–return trade-off than an investment in only one type of asset because the

risk-free asset has zero correlation with the risky asset. The combination is called the
capital allocation line (and is depicted in Exhibit 2). Superimposing an investor’s indif-
ference curves on the capital allocation line will lead to the optimal investor portfolio.
    Investors with different levels of risk aversion will choose different portfolios.
Highly risk-averse investors choose to invest most of their wealth in the risk-free asset
and earn low returns because they are not willing to assume higher levels of risk. Less
risk-averse investors, in contrast, invest more of their wealth in the risky asset, which
is expected to yield a higher return. Obviously, the higher return cannot come without
higher risk, but the less risk-averse investor is willing to accept the additional risk.

Combining a Risk-Free Asset with a Portfolio of Risky Assets
We can extend the analysis of one risky asset to a portfolio of risky assets. For con-
venience, assume that the portfolio contains all available risky assets (N), although
an investor may not wish to include all of these assets in the portfolio because of the
investor’s specific preferences. If an asset is not included in the portfolio, its weight
will be zero. The risk–return characteristics of a portfolio of N risky assets are given
by the following equations:
                       N
   E​(
     ​ ​Rp​ ​)​​ = ∑
                   ​ ​w​i​E​(​ ​Ri​​)​​
                      i=1
      
    	​                            ​                              ​

             (i=1,j=1                           )
                 N                                     N
   ​σ​p​​ = ​​ ​ ∑ ​w​i​​w​j​Cov​(​ ​i, j​)​​ ​​, and ∑
       2                                              ​ ​w​i​ = 1​
                                                              i=1

The expected return on the portfolio, E(Rp), is the weighted average of the expected
returns of individual assets, where wi is the fractional weight in asset i and Ri is the
expected return of asset i. The risk of the portfolio (σp), however, depends on the
weights of the individual assets, the risk of the individual assets, and their interrela-
tionships. The covariance between assets i and j, Cov(i,j), is a statistical measure of the
interrelationship between each pair of assets in the portfolio and can be expressed as
follows, where ρij is the correlation between assets i and j and σi is the risk of asset i:
   Cov(i,j) = ρijσiσj
Note from the equation below that the correlation of an asset with itself is 1; therefore:

The suggestion that portfolios have lower risk than the assets they contain may seem
counterintuitive. These portfolios can be constructed, however, as long as the assets
in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated. As an illustration of the effect of asset
weights on portfolio characteristics, consider a simple two-asset portfolio with zero
weights in all other assets. Assume that Asset 1 has a return of 10 percent and a stan-
dard deviation (risk) of 20 percent. Asset 2 has a return of 5 percent and a standard
deviation (risk) of 10 percent. Furthermore, the correlation between the two assets is
zero. Exhibit 1 shows risks and returns for Portfolio X with a weight of 25 percent in
Asset 1 and 75 percent in Asset 2, Portfolio Y with a weight of 50 percent in each of
the two assets, and Portfolio Z with a weight of 75 percent in Asset 1 and 25 percent
in Asset 2.

                         From this example we observe that the three portfolios are quite different in terms of
                         their risk and return. Portfolio X has a 6.25 percent return and only 9.01 percent stan-
                         dard deviation, whereas the standard deviation of Portfolio Z is more than two-thirds
                         higher (15.21 percent), although the return is only slightly more than one-third higher
                         (8.75 percent). These portfolios may become even more dissimilar as other assets are
                         added to the mix.
                             Consider three portfolios of risky assets, A, B, and C, as in Exhibit 2, that may have
                         been presented to a representative investor by three different investment advisers.
                         Each portfolio is combined with the risk-free asset to create three capital allocation
                         lines, CAL(A), CAL(B), and CAL(C). The exhibit shows that Portfolio C is superior to
                         the other two portfolios because it has a greater expected return for any given level of
                         risk. As a result, an investor will choose the portfolio that lies on the capital allocation
                         line for Portfolio C. The combination of the risk-free asset and the risky Portfolio C
                         that is selected for an investor depends on the investor’s degree of risk aversion.

Capital Market Theory: Risk-Free and Risky Assets                                             67


Does a Unique Optimal Risky Portfolio Exist?
We assume that all investors have the same economic expectation and thus have the
same expectations of prices, cash flows, and other investment characteristics. This
assumption is referred to as homogeneity of expectations. Given these investment
characteristics, everyone goes through the same calculations and should arrive at
the same optimal risky portfolio. Therefore, assuming homogeneous expectations,
only one optimal portfolio exists. If investors have different expectations, however,
they might arrive at different optimal risky portfolios. To illustrate, we begin with an
expression for the price of an asset:
          T      ​CF​t​
         ​ ​_t ​
   	​P = ∑
         t=0 ​(​1 + ​r​t​)​​

where CFt is the cash flow at the end of period t and rt is the discount rate or the
required rate of return for that asset for period t. Period t refers to all periods begin-
ning from now until the asset ceases to exist at the end of time T. Because the current
time is the end of period 0, which is the same as the beginning of period 1, there are
(T + 1) cash flows and (T + 1) required rates of return. These conditions are based
on the assumption that a cash flow, such as an initial investment, can occur now (t =
0). Ordinarily, however, CF0 is zero.
    We use the formula for the price of an asset to estimate the intrinsic value of an
asset. Assume that the asset we are valuing is a share of Siemens AG which trades
on Xetra. In the case of corporate stock, there is no expiration date, so T could be
extremely large, meaning we will need to estimate a large number of cash flows and
rates of return. Fortunately, the denominator reduces the importance of distant cash
flows, so it may be sufficient to estimate, say, 20 annual cash flows and 20 rates of
returns. How much will Siemens earn next year and the year after next? What will
the product markets Siemens operates in look like in five years’ time? Different ana-
lysts and investors will have their own estimates that may be quite different from one
another. Also, as we delve further into the future, more serious issues in estimating
future revenue, expenses, and growth rates arise. Therefore, to assume that cash flow
estimates for Siemens will vary among these investors is reasonable. In addition to the
numerator (cash flows), it is also necessary to estimate the denominator, the required
rates of return. We know that riskier companies will require higher returns because
risk and return are positively correlated. Siemens stock is riskier than a risk-free asset,
but by how much? And what should the compensation for that additional risk be?
Again, it is evident that different analysts will view the riskiness of Siemens differently
and, therefore, arrive at different required rates of return.
    Siemens closed at €111.84 on Xetra on 31 August 2018. The traded price represents
the value that a marginal investor attaches to a share of Siemens, say, corresponding
to Analyst A’s expectation. Analyst B may think that the price should be €95, however,
and Analyst C may think that the price should be €125. Given a price of €111.84, the
expected returns of Siemens are quite different for the three analysts. Analyst B, who
believes the price should be €95, concludes that Siemens is overvalued and may assign
a weight of zero to Siemens in the recommended portfolio even though the market
capitalization of Siemens was in excess of €100 billion as of the date of the quotation.
In contrast, Analyst C, with a valuation of €125, thinks Siemens is undervalued and
may significantly overweight Siemens in a portfolio.
    Our discussion illustrates that analysts can arrive at different valuations that
necessitate the assignment of different asset weights in a portfolio. Given the existence
of many asset classes and numerous assets in each asset class, one can visualize that
each investor will have his or her own optimal risky portfolio depending on his or her
assumptions underlying the valuation computations. Therefore, market participants
will have their own and possibly different optimal risky portfolios.

                             If investors have different valuations of assets, then the construction of a unique
                         optimal risky portfolio is not possible. If we make a simplifying assumption of homoge-
                         neity in investor expectations, we will have a single optimal risky portfolio as previously
                         mentioned. Even if investors have different expectations, market prices are a proxy
                         of what the marginal, informed investor expects, and the market portfolio becomes
                         the base case, the benchmark, or the reference portfolio that other portfolios can be
                         judged against. For Siemens, the market price was €111.84 per share and the market
                         capitalization was about €108 billion. In constructing the market portfolio, Siemens’s
                         weight in the market portfolio will be equal to its market value divided by the value
                         of all other assets included in the market portfolio.

                                       (CML)

                         In the previous section, we discussed how the risk-free asset could be combined with
                         a risky portfolio to create a capital allocation line (CAL). In this section, we discuss a
                         specific CAL that uses the market portfolio as the optimal risky portfolio and is known
                         as the capital market line. We also discuss the significance of the market portfolio and
                         applications of the capital market line (CML).


                         Passive and Active Portfolios
                         In the above subsection, we hypothesized three possible valuations for each share of
                         Siemens: €95, €111.84, and €125. Which one is correct?
                              If the market is an informationally efficient market, the price in the market,
                         €111.84, is an unbiased estimate of all future discounted cash flows (recall the formula
                         for the price of an asset). In other words, the price aggregates and reflects all infor-
                         mation that is publicly available, and investors cannot expect to earn a return that is
                         greater than the required rate of return for that asset. If, however, the price reflects
                         all publicly available information and there is no way to outperform the market, then
                         there is little point in investing time and money in evaluating Siemens to arrive at
                         your price using your own estimates of cash flows and rates of return.
                              In that case, a simple and convenient approach to investing is to rely on the prices
                         set by the market. Portfolios that are based on the assumption of unbiased market prices
                         are referred to as passive portfolios. Passive portfolios most commonly replicate and
                         track market indexes, which are passively constructed on the basis of market prices
                         and market capitalizations. Examples of market indexes are the S&P 500 Index, the
                         Nikkei 300, and the CAC 40. Passive portfolios based on market indexes are called
                         index funds and generally have low costs because no significant effort is expended in
                         valuing securities that are included in an index.
                              In contrast to passive investors’ reliance on market prices and index funds, active
                         investors may not rely on market valuations. They have more confidence in their
                         own ability to estimate cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates. Based on these
                         estimates, they value assets and determine whether an asset is fairly valued. In an
                         actively managed portfolio, assets that are undervalued, or have a chance of offering
                         above-normal returns, will have a positive weight (i.e., overweight compared to the
                         market weight in the benchmark index), whereas other assets will have a zero weight,

or even a negative weight if short selling is permitted (i.e., some assets will be under-
weighted compared with the market weight in the benchmark index). (Short selling
is a transaction in which borrowed securities are sold with the intention to repur-
chase them at a lower price at a later date and return them to the lender.) This style
of investing is called active investment management, and the portfolios are referred
to as active portfolios. Most open-end mutual funds and hedge funds practice active
investment management, and most analysts believe that active investing adds value.
Whether these analysts are right or wrong is the subject of continuing debate.


What Is the “Market”?
In the previous discussion, we referred to the “market” on numerous occasions without
actually defining the market. The optimal risky portfolio and the capital market line
depend on the definition of the market. So what is the market?
    Theoretically, the market includes all risky assets or anything that has value, which
includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and even human capital. Not all assets are tradable,
however, and not all tradable assets are investable. For example, the Taj Mahal in India
is an asset but is not a tradable asset. Similarly, human capital is an asset that is not
tradable. Moreover, assets may be tradable but not investable because of restrictions
placed on certain kinds of investors. For example, all stocks listed on the Shanghai
Stock Exchange are tradable. However, whereas Class A shares are listed in RMB and
open to domestic investors and qualified foreign investors, Class B shares are listed in
USD and open to foreign investors and domestic investors holding foreign currency
dealing accounts.
    If we consider all stocks, bonds, real estate assets, commodities, etc., probably
hundreds of thousands of assets are tradable and investable. The “market” should
contain as many assets as possible; we emphasize the word “possible” because it is not
practical to include all assets in a single risky portfolio. Even though advancements in
technology and interconnected markets have made it much easier to span the major
equity markets, we are still not able to easily invest in other kinds of assets like bonds
and real estate except in the most developed countries.
    For the rest of this reading, we will define the “market” quite narrowly because it is
practical and convenient to do so. Typically, a local or regional stock market index is
used as a proxy for the market because of active trading in stocks and because a local
or regional market is most visible to the local investors. For our purposes, we will use
the S&P 500 Index as the market’s proxy. The S&P 500 is commonly used by analysts
as a benchmark for market performance throughout the United States. It contains
500 of the largest stocks that are domiciled in the United States, and these stocks are
weighted by their market capitalization (price times the number of outstanding shares).
    As of mid-2018, the stocks in the S&P 500 account for approximately 80 percent of
the total equity market capitalization in the United States, and because the US stock
markets represent about 40 percent of the world markets, the S&P 500 represents
roughly 32 percent of worldwide publicly traded equity. Our definition of the market
does not include non-US stock markets, bond markets, real estate, and many other
asset classes, and therefore, “market” return and the “market” risk premium refer to
US equity return and the US equity risk premium, respectively. The use of this proxy,
however, is sufficient for our discussion, and is relatively easy to expand to include
other tradable assets.


The Capital Market Line (CML)
A capital allocation line includes all possible combinations of the risk-free asset and
an investor’s optimal risky portfolio. The capital market line is a special case of the
capital allocation line, where the risky portfolio is the market portfolio. The risk-free

                         asset is a debt security with no default risk, no inflation risk, no liquidity risk, no
                         interest rate risk, and no risk of any other kind. US Treasury bills are usually used as
                         a proxy of the risk-free return, Rf.
                             The S&P 500 is a proxy of the market portfolio, which is the optimal risky portfolio.
                         Therefore, the expected return on the risky portfolio is the expected market return,
                         expressed as E(Rm). The capital market line is shown in Exhibit 3, where the standard
                         deviation (σp), or total risk, is on the x-axis and expected portfolio return, E(Rp), is on
                         the y-axis. Graphically, the market portfolio is the point on the Markowitz efficient
                         frontier where a line from the risk-free asset is tangent to the Markowitz efficient
                         frontier. All points on the interior of the Markowitz efficient frontier are inefficient
                         portfolios in that they provide the same level of return with a higher level of risk or
                         a lower level of return with the same amount of risk. When plotted together, the

                         combination of risky assets, on the basis of market prices and market capitalizations.
                         The optimal risky portfolio is the market portfolio.

                         The CML’s intercept on the y-axis is the risk-free return (Rf) because that is the
                         return associated with zero risk. The CML passes through the point represented by
                         the market return, E(Rm). With respect to capital market theory, any point above the
                         CML is not achievable and any point below the CML is dominated by and inferior to
                         any point on the CML.
                             Note that we identify the CML and CAL as lines even though they are a combi-
                         nation of two assets. Unlike a combination of two risky assets, which is usually not
                         a straight line, a combination of the risk-free asset and a risky portfolio is a straight
                         line, as illustrated below by computing the combination’s risk and return.
                             Risk and return characteristics of the portfolio represented by the CML can be
                         computed by using the return and risk expressions for a two-asset portfolio:
                                       E(Rp) = w1Rf + (1 – w1)E(Rm),

The proportion invested in the risk-free asset is given by w1, and the balance is invested
in the market portfolio, (1 – w1). The risk of the risk-free asset is given by σf, the risk
of the market is given by σm, the risk of the portfolio is given by σp, and the covariance
between the risk-free asset and the market portfolio is represented by Cov(Rf,Rm).
     By definition, the standard deviation of the risk-free asset is zero. Because its risk
is zero, the risk-free asset does not co-vary or move with any other asset. Therefore,
its covariance with all other assets, including the market portfolio, is zero, making the
first and third terms under the square root sign zero. As a result, the portfolio return
and portfolio standard deviation can be simplified and rewritten as:
   E(Rp) = w1Rf + (1 – w1)E(Rm),
   and
   σp = (1 – w1)σm
By substitution, we can express E(Rp) in terms of σp. Substituting for w1, we get:


                             (                      )

Note that the expression is in the form of a line, y = a + bx. The y-intercept is the
risk-free rate, and the slope of the line referred to as the market price of risk is [E(Rm)
– Rf]/σm. The CML has a positive slope because the market’s risky return is larger
than the risk-free return. As the amount of the total investment devoted to the mar-
ket increases—that is, as we move up the line—both standard deviation (risk) and
expected return increase.

EXAMPLE 1

   Risk and Return on the CML
   Mr. Miles is a first time investor and wants to build a portfolio using only US
   T-bills and an index fund that closely tracks the S&P 500 Index. The T-bills have
   a return of 5 percent. The S&P 500 has a standard deviation of 20 percent and
   an expected return of 15 percent.

   1. Draw the CML and mark the points where the investment in the market is 0
      percent, 25 percent, 75 percent, and 100 percent.

   Solution:
      We calculate the equation for the CML as E(Rp) = 5% + 0.50 × σp by substi-
      tuting the given information into the general CML equation. The intercept
      of the line is 5 percent, and its slope is 0.50. We can draw the CML by arbi-
      trarily taking any two points on the line that satisfy the above equation.
      Alternatively, the CML can be drawn by connecting the risk-free return of 5
      percent on the y-axis with the market portfolio at (20 percent, 15 percent).
      The CML is shown in Exhibit 4.

                            Solution:
                                          Return with 0 percent invested in the market
                                          = 5 percent, which is the risk-free return.

                                          Standard deviation with 0 percent invested in the market
                                          = 0 percent because T-bills are not risky.

                                          Return with 25 percent invested in the market = (0.75 × 5%) + (0.25 × 15%)
                                          = 7.5%.

                                          Standard deviation with 25 percent invested in the market = 0.25 × 20% = 5%.

                                          Return with 75 percent invested in the market = (0.25 × 5%) + (0.75 × 15%)
                                          = 12.50%.

                                          Standard deviation with 75 percent invested in the market = 0.75 × 20% = 15%.

                                          Return with 100 percent invested in the market
                                          = 15 percent, which is the return on the S&P 500.

                                          Standard deviation with 100 percent invested in the market
                                          = 20 percent, which is the risk of the S&P 500.

Capital Market Theory: CML - Leveraged Portfolios                                               73



CAPITAL MARKET THEORY: CML - LEVERAGED
PORTFOLIOS                                                                                  4
              explain the capital allocation line (CAL) and the capital market line
              (CML)

In the previous example, Mr. Miles evaluated an investment of between 0 percent and
100 percent in the market and the balance in T-bills. The line connecting Rf and M
(market portfolio) in Exhibit 4 illustrates these portfolios with their respective levels
of investment. At Rf, an investor is investing all of his or her wealth into risk-free
securities, which is equivalent to lending 100 percent at the risk-free rate. At Point M
he or she is holding the market portfolio and not lending any money at the risk-free
rate. The combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio, which may be
achieved by the points between these two limits, are termed “lending” portfolios. In
effect, the investor is lending part of his or her wealth at the risk-free rate.
    If Mr. Miles is willing to take more risk, he may be able to move to the right of the
market portfolio (Point M in Exhibit 4) by borrowing money and purchasing more
of Portfolio M. Assume that he is able to borrow money at the same risk-free rate of
interest, Rf, at which he can invest. He can then supplement his available wealth with
borrowed money and construct a borrowing portfolio. If the straight line joining Rf
and M is extended to the right of Point M, this extended section of the line represents
borrowing portfolios. As one moves further to the right of Point M, an increasing
amount of borrowed money is being invested in the market. This means that there is
negative investment in the risk-free asset, which is referred to as a leveraged position
in the risky portfolio. The particular point chosen on the CML will depend on the
individual’s utility function, which, in turn, will be determined by his risk and return
preferences.

EXAMPLE 2

   Risk and Return of a Leveraged Portfolio with Equal
   Lending and Borrowing Rates

   1. Mr. Miles decides to set aside a small part of his wealth for investment in
      a portfolio that has greater risk than his previous investments because he
      anticipates that the overall market will generate attractive returns in the
      future. He assumes that he can borrow money at 5 percent and achieve the
      same return on the S&P 500 as before: an expected return of 15 percent with
      a standard deviation of 20 percent.

      Calculate his expected risk and return if he borrows 25 percent, 50 percent,
      and 100 percent of his initial investment amount.

   Solution:
      The leveraged portfolio’s standard deviation and return can be calculated in
      the same manner as before with the following equations:
      E(Rp) = w1Rf + (1 – w1)E(Rm)
      and

                                σp = (1 – w1)σm
                               The proportion invested in T-bills becomes negative instead of positive be-
                               cause Mr. Miles is borrowing money. If 25 percent of the initial investment
                               is borrowed, w1 = –0.25, and (1 – w1) = 1.25, etc.
                                Return with w1 = –0.25 = (–0.25 × 5%) + (1.25 × 15%) = 17.5%.

                                Standard deviation with w1 = –0.25 = 1.25 × 20% = 25%.

                                Return with w1 = –0.50 = (–0.50 × 5%) + (1.50 × 15%) = 20.0%.

                                Standard deviation with w1 = –0.50 = 1.50 × 20% = 30%.

                                Return with w1 = –1.00 = (–1.00 × 5%) + (2.00 × 15%) = 25.0%.

                                Standard deviation with w1 = –1.00 = 2.00 × 20% = 40%.
                               Note that negative investment (borrowing) in the risk-free asset provides a
                               higher expected return for the portfolio but that higher return is also associ-
                               ated with higher risk.



                         Leveraged Portfolios with Different Lending and Borrowing
                         Rates
                         Although we assumed that Mr. Miles can borrow at the same rate as the US government,
                         it is more likely that he will have to pay a higher interest rate than the government
                         because his ability to repay is not as certain as that of the government. Now consider
                         that although Mr. Miles can invest (lend) at Rf, he can borrow at only Rb, a rate that
                         is higher than the risk-free rate.
                              With different lending and borrowing rates, the CML will no longer be a single

The first equation is for the line where the investment in the risk-free asset is zero
or positive—that is, at M or to the left of M in Exhibit 5. The second equation is for
the line where borrowing, or negative investment in the risk-free asset, occurs. Note
that the only difference between the two equations is in the interest rates used for
borrowing and lending.
    All passive portfolios will lie on the kinked CML, although the investment in the
risk-free asset may be positive (lending), zero (no lending or borrowing), or negative
(borrowing). Leverage allows less risk-averse investors to increase the amount of risk
they take by borrowing money and investing more than 100 percent in the passive
portfolio.

     1. Mr. Miles approaches his broker to borrow money against securities held in
        his portfolio. Even though Mr. Miles’ loan will be secured by the securities
        in his portfolio, the broker’s rate for lending to customers is 7 percent. As-
        suming a risk-free rate of 5 percent and a market return of 15 percent with
        a standard deviation of 20 percent, estimate Mr. Miles’ expected return and
        risk if he invests 25 percent and 75 percent in the market and if he decides

                               to borrow 25 percent and 75 percent of his initial investment and invest the
                               money in the market.

                            Solution:
                               The unleveraged portfolio’s standard deviation and return are calculated
                               using the same equations as before:
                                E(Rp) = w1Rf + (1 – w1)E(Rm),
                               and
                                σp = (1 – w1)σm
                               The results are unchanged. The slope of the line for the unleveraged portfo-
                               lio is 0.50, just as before:
                                Return with 25 percent invested in the market = (0.75 × 5%) + (0.25 × 15%)
                                = 7.5%.

                                Standard deviation with 25 percent invested in the market = 0.25 × 20% = 5%.

                                Return with 75 percent invested in the market = (0.25 × 5%) + (0.75 × 15%)
                                = 12.5%.

                                Standard deviation with 75 percent invested in the market = 0.75 × 20% = 15%.
                               For the leveraged portfolio, everything remains the same except that Rf is
                               replaced with Rb.
                                E(Rp) = w1Rb + (1 – w1)E(Rm),
                               and
                                σp = (1 – w1)σm.

                                Return with w1 = –0.25 = (–0.25 × 7%) + (1.25 × 15%) = 17.0%.

                                Standard deviation with w1 = –0.25 = 1.25 × 20% = 25%.

                                Return with w1 = –0.75 = (–0.75 × 7%) + (1.75 × 15%) = 21.0%.

                                Standard deviation with w1 = –0.75 = 1.75 × 20% = 35%.

                                	 
                               The risk and return of the leveraged portfolio is higher than that of the
                               unleveraged portfolio. As Mr. Miles borrows more money to invest in the
                               market, the expected return increases but so does the standard deviation of
                               the portfolio. The slope of the line for the leveraged portfolio is 0.40, com-
                               pared with 0.50 for the unleveraged portfolio, which means that for every 1
                               percent increase in risk, the investor gets a 0.40 percent increase in expected
                               return in the leveraged part of the portfolio, compared with a 0.50 percent
                               increase in expected return in the unleveraged part of the portfolio. Only
                               investors who are less risk averse will choose leveraged portfolios.

              explain systematic and nonsystematic risk, including why an
              investor should not expect to receive additional return for bearing
              nonsystematic risk

In constructing a portfolio, it is important to understand the concept of correlation
and how less than perfect correlation can diversify the risk of a portfolio. As a conse-
quence, the risk of an asset held alone may be greater than the risk of that same asset
when it is part of a portfolio. Because the risk of an asset varies from one environment
to another, which kind of risk should an investor consider and how should that risk
be priced? This section addresses the question of pricing of risk by decomposing
the total risk of a security or a portfolio into systematic and nonsystematic risk. The
meaning of these risks, how they are computed, and their relevance to the pricing of
assets are also discussed.


Systematic Risk and Nonsystematic Risk
Systematic risk, also known as non-diversifiable or market risk, is the risk that affects
the entire market or economy. In contrast, nonsystematic risk is the risk that pertains to
a single company or industry and is also known as company-specific, industry-specific,
diversifiable, or idiosyncratic risk.
     Systematic risk is risk that cannot be avoided and is inherent in the overall market.
It is non-diversifiable because it includes risk factors that are innate within the market
and affect the market as a whole. Examples of factors that constitute systematic risk
include interest rates, inflation, economic cycles, political uncertainty, and widespread
natural disasters. These events affect the entire market, and there is no way to avoid
their effect. Systematic risk can be magnified through selection or by using leverage,
or diminished by including securities that have a low correlation with the portfolio,
assuming they are not already part of the portfolio.
     Nonsystematic risk is risk that is local or limited to a particular asset or indus-
try that need not affect assets outside of that asset class. Examples of nonsystematic
risk could include the failure of a drug trial or an airliner crash. All these events will
directly affect their respective companies and possibly industries, but have no effect
on assets that are far removed from these industries. Investors can avoid nonsystem-
atic risk through diversification by forming a portfolio of assets that are not highly
correlated with one another.
     We will derive expressions for each kind of risk later in this reading. You will
see that the sum of systematic variance and nonsystematic variance equals the total
variance of the security or portfolio:
   Total variance = Systematic variance + Nonsystematic variance
Although the equality relationship is between variances, you will find frequent ref-
erences to total risk as the sum of systematic risk and nonsystematic risk. In those
cases, the statements refer to variance, not standard deviation.

Pricing of Risk
Pricing or valuing an asset is equivalent to estimating its expected rate of return. If
an asset has a known terminal value, such as the face value of a bond, then a lower
current price implies a higher future return and a higher current price implies a lower

                         future return. The relationship between price and return can also be observed in the
                         valuation expression shown in Section 2.1.2. Therefore, we will occasionally use price
                         and return interchangeably when discussing the price of risk.
                             Consider an asset with both systematic and nonsystematic risk. Assume that both
                         kinds of risk are priced—that is, you receive a return for both systematic risk and non-
                         systematic risk. What will you do? Realizing that nonsystematic risk can be diversified
                         away, you would buy assets that have a large amount of nonsystematic risk. Once you
                         have bought those assets with nonsystematic risk, you would diversify, or reduce that
                         risk, by including other assets that are not highly correlated. In the process, you will
                         minimize nonsystematic risk and eventually eliminate it altogether from your portfolio.
                         You would now have a diversified portfolio with only systematic risk, yet you would be
                         compensated for nonsystematic risk that you no longer have. Just like everyone else,
                         you would have an incentive to take on more and more diversifiable risk because you
                         are compensated for it even though you can get rid of it. The demand for diversifiable
                         risk would keep increasing until its price becomes infinite and its expected return falls
                         to zero. This means that our initial assumption of a non-zero return for diversifiable
                         risk was incorrect and that the correct assumption is zero return for diversifiable risk.
                         Therefore, according to theory, in an efficient market no incremental reward is earned
                         for taking on diversifiable risk.
                             We have argued that investors should not be compensated for taking on nonsys-
                         tematic risk. Therefore, investors who have nonsystematic risk must diversify it away by
                         investing in many industries, many countries, and many asset classes. Because future
                         returns are unknown and it is not possible to pick only winners, diversification helps
                         in offsetting poor returns in one asset class by garnering good returns in another asset
                         class, thereby reducing the overall risk of the portfolio. In contrast, investors must
                         be compensated for accepting systematic risk because that risk cannot be diversified
                         away. If investors do not receive a return commensurate with the amount of systematic
                         risk they are taking, they will refuse to accept systematic risk.
                             In summary, according to theory, systematic or non-diversifiable risk is priced
                         and investors are compensated for holding assets or portfolios based only on that
                         investment’s systematic risk. Investors do not receive any return for accepting non-
                         systematic or diversifiable risk. Therefore, it is in the interest of risk-averse investors
                         to hold only well-diversified portfolios.

                            Systematic and Nonsystematic Risk
                                1. Describe the systematic and nonsystematic risk components of the
                                   following assets:
                                   A. A risk-free asset, such as a three-month Treasury bill
                                   B. The market portfolio, such as the S&P 500.
                                2. Consider two assets, A and B. Asset A has twice the amount of total
                                   risk as Asset B. For Asset A, systematic risk comprises two-thirds of
                                   total risk. For Asset B, all of total risk is systematic risk. Which asset
                                   should have a higher expected rate of return?
                            Solution to 1A:
                            By definition, a risk-free asset has no risk. Therefore, a risk-free asset has zero
                            systematic risk and zero nonsystematic risk.

Return Generating Models                                                                           79


   Solution to 1B:
   As we mentioned earlier, a market portfolio is a diversified portfolio, one in which
   no more risk can be diversified away. We have also described it as an efficient
   portfolio. Therefore, a market portfolio does not contain any nonsystematic risk.

   Solution to 2:
   Based on the facts given, Asset A’s systematic risk is one-third greater than Asset
   B’s systematic risk. Because only systematic risk is priced or receives a return,
   the expected rate of return must be higher for Asset A.




RETURN GENERATING MODELS
                                                                                               6
              explain return generating models (including the market model) and
              their uses

As previously mentioned, in order to form the market portfolio, you should combine
all available risky assets. Knowledge of the correlations among those assets allows us
to estimate portfolio risk. You also learned that a fully diversified portfolio will include
all asset classes and essentially all assets in those asset classes. The work required for
construction of the market portfolio is formidable. For example, for a portfolio of
1,000 assets, we will need 1,000 return estimates, 1,000 standard deviation estimates,
and 499,500 (1,000 × 999 ÷ 2) correlations. Other related questions that arise with
this analysis are whether we really need all 1,000 assets and what happens if there are
errors in these estimates.
     An alternate method of constructing an optimal portfolio is simpler and easier to
implement. An investor begins with a known portfolio, such as the S&P 500, and then
adds other assets one at a time on the basis of the asset’s standard deviation, expected
return, and impact on the portfolio’s risk and return. This process continues until the
addition of another asset does not have a significant impact on the performance of
the portfolio. The process requires only estimates of systematic risk for each asset
because investors will not be compensated for nonsystematic risk. Expected returns
can be calculated by using return-generating models, as we will discuss in this sec-
tion. In addition to using return-generating models, we will also decompose total
variance into systematic variance and nonsystematic variance and establish a formal
relationship between systematic risk and return. In the next section, we will expand
on this discussion and introduce the CAPM as the preferred return-generating model.


Return-Generating Models
A return-generating model is a model that can provide an estimate of the expected
return of a security given certain parameters. If systematic risk is the only relevant
parameter for return, then the return-generating model will estimate the expected
return for any asset given the level of systematic risk.
    As with any model, the quality of estimates of expected return will depend on
the quality of input estimates and the accuracy of the model. Because it is difficult to
decide which factors are appropriate for generating returns, the most general form
of a return-generating model is a multi-factor model. A multi-factor model allows
more than one variable to be considered in estimating returns and can be built using
different kinds of factors, such as macroeconomic, fundamental, and statistical factors.

                             Macroeconomic factor models use economic factors that are correlated with
                         security returns. These factors may include economic growth, the interest rate, the
                         inflation rate, productivity, employment, and consumer confidence. Past relation-
                         ships with returns are estimated to obtain parameter estimates, which are, in turn,
                         used for computing expected returns. Fundamental factor models analyze and use
                         relationships between security returns and the company’s underlying fundamentals,
                         such as, for example, earnings, earnings growth, cash flow generation, investment
                         in research, advertising, and number of patents. Finally, in a statistical factor model,
                         historical and cross-sectional return data are analyzed to identify factors that explain
                         variance or covariance in observed returns. These statistical factors, however, may or
                         may not have an economic or fundamental connection to returns. For example, the
                         conference to which the American football Super Bowl winner belongs, whether the
                         American Football Conference or the National Football Conference, may be a factor
                         in US stock returns, but no obvious economic connection seems to exist between the
                         winner’s conference and US stock returns. Moreover, data mining may generate many
                         spurious factors that are devoid of any economic meaning. Because of this limitation,
                         analysts prefer the macroeconomic and fundamental factor models for specifying and
                         estimating return-generating models.
                             A general return-generating model is expressed in the following manner:
                                                        k                                                        k
                             	​E​(​ ​Ri​​)​​− R       ​ ​βij​ ​E​(
                                              ​ f​​ = ∑                          ​ ​​[​E​(​ ​Rm
                                                                 ​ ​Fj​​)​​ = β​ i1           ​ ​)​​− ​Rf​​]​​+ ∑
                                                                                                                ​ ​βij​ ​E​(
                                                                                                                           ​ ​Fj​​)​​
                                                       j=1                                                      j=2

                         The model has k factors, E(F1), E(F2), ... E(Fk). The coefficients, βij, are the factor
                         weights (sometimes called factor loadings) associated with each factor. The left-hand
                         side of the model has the expected excess return (i.e., the expected return over the
                         risk-free rate). The right-hand side provides the risk factors that would generate the
                         return or premium required to assume that risk. We have separated out one factor,
                         E(Rm), which represents the market return. All models contain return on the market
                         portfolio as a key factor.

                         Three-Factor and Four-Factor Models
                         Eugene Fama and Kenneth French1 suggested that a return-generating model for stock
                         returns should include relative market capitalization of the company (“size”) relative
                         book-to-market value of the company in addition to beta. Fama and French found
                         that past returns could be explained better with their model than with other models
                         available at that time, most notably, the capital asset pricing model. Mark Carhart
                         (1997) extended the Fama and French model by adding another factor: momentum,
                         defined as relative past stock returns.

                         The Single-Index Model
                         The simplest form of a return-generating model is a single-factor linear model, in which
                         only one factor is considered. The most common implementation is a single-index
                         model, which uses the market factor in the following form: E(Ri) – Rf = βi[E(Rm) – Rf].
                            Although the single-index model is simple, it fits nicely with the capital market line.
                         Recall that the CML is linear, with an intercept of Rf and a slope of [E(Rm) – Rf]/σm.
                         We can rewrite the CML by moving the intercept to the left-hand side of the equation,
                         rearranging the terms, and generalizing the subscript from p to i, for any security:
                                                            ​σ​i​
                                             ​ f​​ = ​(
                             	​E​​(​Ri​​)​​− R        ​_​​σ​m​​)​​​[​E​(​ ​Rm
                                                                            ​ ​)​​− ​Rf​​]​​

Return Generating Models                                                                                                   81


    The factor loading or factor weight, σi/σm, refers to the ratio of total security risk
to total market risk. To obtain a better understanding of factor loading and to illus-
trate that the CML reduces to a single-index model, we decompose total risk into its
components.


Decomposition of Total Risk for a Single-Index Model
With the introduction of return-generating models, particularly the single-index
model, we are able to decompose total variance into systematic and nonsystematic
variances. Instead of using expected returns in the single index, let us use realized
returns. The difference between expected returns and realized returns is attributable
to non-market changes, as an error term, ei, in the second equation below:
   E(Ri) – Rf = βi[E(Rm) – Rf]
and
   Ri – Rf = βi(Rm – Rf) + ei
The variance of realized returns can be expressed in the equation below (note that
Rf is a constant). We can further drop the covariance term in this equation because,
by definition, any non-market return is uncorrelated with the market. Thus, we are
able to decompose total variance into systematic and nonsystematic variances in the
second equation below:
   	​σ​i2​​ = ​βi​2​​​σ​m2 ​+ ​σ​e2​​+ 2Cov​(​ ​Rm
                                                 ​ ​, e​ ​i​)​​
Total variance = Systematic variance + Nonsystematic variance, which can be written as
   	​σ​i2​​ = ​βi​2​​​σ​m2 ​+ ​σ​e2​​
Total risk can be expressed as
                _
   	​σ​i​ = √
            ​ ​βi​2​​σ​ ​m2 ​+ ​σ​e2​​
Because nonsystematic risk is zero for well-diversified portfolios, such as the market
portfolio, the total risk of a market portfolio and other similar portfolios is only sys-
tematic risk, which is βiσm. We can now return to the CML discussed in the previous
subsection and replace σi with βiσm because the CML assumes that the market is a
diversified portfolio. By making this substitution for the above equation, we get the
following single-index model:

                                                      ​ ​)​​− ​Rf​​]​​ = ​( ​ ​σ​m​ ​)​​× ​[​ ​E​(​ ​Rm
                                    ​σ​i​                                     ​βi​​σ​ ​m​
                   ​ f​​ = ​(
   	​E​​(​Ri​​)​​− R        ​_​​σ​m​​)​​× ​[​ ​E​(​ ​Rm                   ​_                          ​ ​)​​− ​Rf​​]​​,​

   E(Ri) – Rf = βi[E(Rm) – Rf]
Thus, the CML, which holds only for well-diversified portfolios, is fully consistent
with a single-index model.
    In summary, total variance may be decomposed into systematic and nonsystematic
variances and the CML is the same as a single-index model for diversified portfolios.


Return-Generating Models: The Market Model
The most common implementation of a single-index model is the market model, in
which the market return is the single factor or single index. In principle, the market
model and the single-index model are similar. The difference is that the market model
is easier to work with and is normally used for estimating beta risk and computing
abnormal returns. The market model is
   Ri = αi + βiRm + ei

                         To be consistent with the previous section, αi = Rf(1 – β). The intercept, αi, and slope
                         coefficient, βi, can be estimated by using historical security and market returns. These
                         parameter estimates are then used to predict company-specific returns that a security
                         may earn in a future period. Assume that a regression of Wal-Mart’s historical daily
                         returns on S&P 500 daily returns gives an αi of 0.0001 and a βi of 0.9. Thus, Wal-Mart’s
                         expected daily return = 0.0001 + 0.90 × Rm. If, on a given day the market rises by 1
                         percent and Wal-Mart’s stock rises by 2 percent, then Wal-Mart’s company-specific
                         return (ei) for that day = Ri − E(Ri) = Ri – (αi + βiRm) = 0.02 – (0.0001 + 0.90 × 0.01)
                         = 0.0109, or 1.09%. In other words, Wal-Mart earned an abnormal return of 1.09
                         percent on that day.




             7           CALCULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF BETA

                                               calculate and interpret beta

                         We begin with the single-index model introduced earlier using realized returns and
                         rewrite it as
                             Ri = (1 – βi)Rf + βi × Rm + ei
                         Because systematic risk depends on the correlation between the asset and the market,
                         we can arrive at a measure of systematic risk from the covariance between Ri and Rm,
                         where Ri is defined using the above equation. Note that the risk-free rate is a constant,
                         so the first term in Ri drops out.
                             Cov​​(​Ri​​, R
                                          ​m​ ​)​​ = Cov​(​ ​βi​​× ​Rm             ​ ​)​​
                                                                     ​ ​+ ​e​i​, ​Rm
                           =	​ β​ i​​Cov​(​ ​Rm
                              
                                              ​ ​, R
                                                   ​m​ ​)​​ + Cov​(​ ​e​i​, R
                                                                            ​m​ ​)​​ ​​
                           = ​βi​​​σ​m2 ​+ 0
                         The first term is beta multiplied by the variance of Rm. Because the error term is
                         uncorrelated with the market, the second term drops out. Then, we can rewrite the
                         equation in terms of beta as follows:
                                      Cov​(​ ​Ri​​, ​Rm
                                                      ​ ​)​​   ​ρ​i,m​σ​ ​i​σ​ ​m​   ​ρ​i,m​​σ​i​
                             	​βi​​ = _
                                      ​ 2 ​= _
                                             ​ 2 ​= _
                                                    ​ ​σ​m​ ​
                                            ​σ​m​                   ​σ​m​

                         The above formula shows the expression for beta, βi, which is similar to the factor load-
                         ing in the single-index model presented earlier. For example, if the correlation between
                         an asset and the market is 0.70 and the asset and market have standard deviations of
                         return of 0.25 and 0.15, respectively, the asset’s beta would be (0.70)(0.25)/0.15 = 1.17.
                         If the asset’s covariance with the market and market variance were given as 0.026250
                         and 0.02250, respectively, the calculation would be 0.026250/0.02250 = 1.17. The beta
                         in the market model includes an adjustment for the correlation between asset i and
                         the market because the market model covers all assets whereas the CML works only
                         for fully diversified portfolios.
                              As shown in the above equation, beta is a measure of how sensitive an asset’s
                         return is to the market as a whole and is calculated as the covariance of the return
                         on i and the return on the market divided by the variance of the market return; that
                         expression is equivalent to the product of the asset’s correlation with the market with
                         a ratio of standard deviations of return (i.e., the ratio of the asset’s standard deviation
                         to the market’s). As we have shown, beta captures an asset’s systematic risk, or the
                         portion of an asset’s risk that cannot be eliminated by diversification. The variances and
                         correlations required for the calculation of beta are usually based on historical returns.

    A positive beta indicates that the return of an asset follows the general market
trend, whereas a negative beta shows that the return of an asset generally follows a
trend that is opposite to that of the market. In other words, a positive beta indicates
that the return of an asset moves in the same direction of the market, whereas a
negative beta indicates that the return of an asset moves in the opposite direction of
the market. A risk-free asset’s beta is zero because its covariance with other assets is
zero. In other words, a beta of zero indicates that the asset’s return has no correlation
with movements in the market. The market’s beta can be calculated by substituting
σm for σi in the numerator. Also, any asset’s correlation with itself is 1, so the beta of
the market is 1:
          ​ρ​i,m​​σ​i​   ​ρm,m
                           ​ ​​σ​m​
   	​βi​​ = _
            ​ ​σ​m​ ​ = _
                        ​ ​σ​m​ ​ = 1​

Because the market’s beta is 1, the average beta of stocks in the market, by definition,
is 1. In terms of correlation, most stocks, especially in developed markets, tend to be
highly correlated with the market, with correlations in excess of 0.70. Some US broad
market indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones 30, and the NASDAQ 100, have
even higher correlations that are in excess of 0.90. The correlations among different
sectors are also high, which shows that companies have similar reactions to the same
economic and market changes. As a consequence and as a practical matter, finding
assets that have a consistently negative beta is unusual because of the market’s broad
effects on all assets.

   Calculation of Beta
   Assuming that the risk (standard deviation) of the market is 25 percent, calculate
   the beta for the following assets:
                                                                                   ​ρ​ ​σ​ ​​
      We use the formula for beta in answering the above questions: ​βi​​ = _
                                                                            ​ i,m  i

   1. A short-term US Treasury bill.

   Solution:
      By definition, a short-term US Treasury bill has zero risk. Therefore, its beta
      is zero.

   2. Gold, which has a standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the
      market but a zero correlation with the market.

   Solution:
      Because the correlation of gold with the market is zero, its beta is zero.

   3. A new emerging market that is not currently included in the definition of
      “market”—the emerging market’s standard deviation is 60 percent, and the
      correlation with the market is –0.1.

   Solution:
      Beta of the emerging market is –0.1 × 0.60 ÷ 0.25 = –0.24.

                            4. An initial public offering or new issue of stock with a standard deviation of
                               40 percent and a correlation with the market of 0.7 (IPOs are usually very
                               risky but have a relatively low correlation with the market).

                            Solution:
                               Beta of the initial public offering is 0.7 × 0.40 ÷ 0.25 = 1.12.



                         Estimation of Beta
                         An alternative and more practical approach is to estimate beta directly by using the
                         market model described above. The market model, Ri = αi + βiRm + ei, is estimated by
                         using regression analysis, which is a statistical process that evaluates the relationship
                         between a given variable (the dependent variable) and one or more other (indepen-
                         dent) variables. Historical security returns (Ri) and historical market returns (Rm) are
                         inputs used for estimating the two parameters αi and βi.
                             Regression analysis is similar to plotting all combinations of the asset’s return
                         and the market return (Ri, Rm) and then drawing a line through all points such that it
                         minimizes the sum of squared linear deviations from the line. Exhibit 6 illustrates the
                         market model and the estimated parameters. The intercept, αi (sometimes referred
                         to as the constant), and the slope term, βi, are all that is needed to define the security
                         characteristic line and obtain beta estimates.

                         Although beta estimates are important for forecasting future levels of risk, there is
                         much concern about their accuracy. In general, shorter periods of estimation (e.g.,
                         12 months) represent betas that are closer to the asset’s current level of systematic
                         risk. Shorter period beta estimates, however, are also less accurate than beta estimates
                         measured over three to five years because they may be affected by special events in that

short period. Although longer period beta estimates are more accurate, they may be
a poor representation of future expectations, especially if major changes in the asset
have occurred. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that estimates of beta, whether
obtained through calculation or regression analysis, may or may not represent current
or future levels of an asset’s systematic risk.


Beta and Expected Return
Although the single-index model, also called the capital asset pricing model (CAPM),
will be discussed in greater detail in the next section, we will use the CAPM in this
section to estimate returns, given asset betas. The CAPM is usually written with the
risk-free rate on the right-hand side:
   E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf]
The model shows that the primary determinant of expected return for a security is
its beta, or how well the security correlates with the market. The higher the beta of
an asset, the higher its expected return will be. Assets with a beta greater than 1 have
an expected return that is higher than the market return, whereas assets with a beta
of less than 1 have an expected return that is less than the market return.
     In certain cases, assets may require a return less than the risk-free return. For
example, if an asset’s beta is negative, the required return will be less than the risk-free
rate. When combined with the market, the asset reduces the risk of the overall portfo-
lio, which makes the asset very valuable. Insurance is one such asset. Insurance gives
a positive return when the insured’s wealth is reduced because of a catastrophic loss.
In the absence of such a loss or when the insured’s wealth is growing, the insured
is required to pay an insurance premium. Thus, insurance has a negative beta and a
negative expected return, but helps in reducing overall risk.

EXAMPLE 6

   Calculation of Expected Return
       1. Alpha Natural Resources (ANR), a coal producer, buys a large but
          privately held coal producer in China. As a result of the cross-border
          acquisition of a private company, ANR’s standard deviation of returns
          is reduced from 50 percent to 30 percent and its correlation with the
          market falls from 0.95 to 0.75. Assume that the standard deviation and
          return of the market remain unchanged at 25 percent and 10 percent,
          respectively, and that the risk-free rate is 3 percent.
           A. Calculate the beta of ANR stock and its expected return before the
              acquisition.
           B. Calculate the expected return after the acquisition.
   Solution to 1A:
   Using the formula for βi, we can calculate βi and then the return.
             ​ρ​i,m​​σ​i​   0.95 × 0.50
       	​βi​​ = _
                ​ ​σ​m​ ​ = _
                            ​ 0.25 ​ = 1.90​

       E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.03 + 1.90 × (0.10 – 0.03) = 0.163 = 16.3%

   Solution to 1B:
   We follow the same procedure but with the after-acquisition correlation and risk.
             ​ρ​i,m​​σ​i​   0.75 × 0.30
       	​βi​​ = _
                ​ ​σ​m​ ​ = _
                            ​ 0.25 ​ = 0.90​

                                E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.03 + 0.90 × (0.10 – 0.03) = 0.093 = 9.3%
                            The market risk premium is 7 percent (10% – 3%). As the beta changes, the
                            change in the security’s expected return is the market risk premium multiplied
                            by the change in beta. In this scenario, ANR’s beta decreased by 1.0, so the new
                            expected return for ANR is 7 percentage points lower.
                                2. Mr. Miles observes the strong demand for iPods and iPhones and
                                   wants to invest in Apple stock. Unfortunately, Mr. Miles doesn’t know
                                   the return he should expect from his investment. He has been given a
                                   risk-free rate of 3 percent, a market return of 10 percent, and Apple’s
                                   beta of 1.5.
                                     A. Calculate Apple’s expected return.
                                     B. An analyst looking at the same information decides that the past
                                        performance of Apple is not representative of its future perfor-
                                        mance. He decides that, given the increase in Apple’s market cap-
                                        italization, Apple acts much more like the market than before and
                                        thinks Apple’s beta should be closer to 1.1. What is the analyst’s
                                        expected return for Apple stock?
                            Solution to 2A:
                                E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.03 + 1.5 × (0.10 – 0.03) = 0.135 = 13.5%

                            Solution to 2B:
                                E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.03 + 1.1 × (0.10 – 0.03) = 0.107 = 10.7%
                            This example illustrates the lack of connection between estimation of past returns
                            and projection into the future. Investors should be aware of the limitations of
                            using past returns for estimating future returns.

                         THE SECURITY MARKET LINE

                                         explain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), including its
                                         assumptions, and the security market line (SML)

                                         CAPM

                         The capital asset pricing model is one of the most significant innovations in portfolio
                         theory. The model is simple, yet powerful; is intuitive, yet profound. The CAPM was
                         introduced independently by William Sharpe, John Lintner, Jack Treynor, and Jan
                         Mossin and builds on Harry Markowitz’s earlier work on diversification and modern
                         portfolio theory.2 The model provides a linear expected return–beta relationship that
                         precisely determines the expected return given the beta of an asset. In doing so, it
                         makes the transition from total risk to systematic risk, the primary determinant of
                         expected return. Recall the following equation:

Capital Asset Pricing Model: Assumptions and the Security Market Line                      87


   E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf]
The CAPM asserts that the expected returns of assets vary only by their systematic
risk as measured by beta. Two assets with the same beta will have the same expected
return irrespective of the nature of those assets. Given the relationship between risk
and return, all assets are defined only by their beta risk, which we will explain as the
assumptions are described.
    In the remainder of this section, we will examine the assumptions made in arriving
at the CAPM and the limitations those assumptions entail. Second, we will implement
the CAPM through the security market line to price any portfolio or asset, both effi-
cient and inefficient. Finally, we will discuss ways in which the CAPM can be applied
to investments, valuation, and capital budgeting.


Assumptions of the CAPM
Similar to all other models, the CAPM ignores many of the complexities of financial
markets by making simplifying assumptions. These assumptions allow us to gain
important insights into how assets are priced without complicating the analysis. Once
the basic relationships are established, we can relax the assumptions and examine how
our insights need to be altered. Some of these assumptions are constraining, whereas
others are benign. And other assumptions affect only a particular set of assets or only
marginally affect the hypothesized relationships.
   1. Investors are risk-averse, utility-maximizing, rational individuals.
       Risk aversion means that investors expect to be compensated for accepting
       risk. Note that the assumption does not require investors to have the same
       degree of risk aversion; it only requires that they are averse to risk. Utility
       maximization implies that investors want higher returns, not lower returns,
       and that investors always want more wealth (i.e., investors are never satis-
       fied). Investors are understood to be rational in that they correctly evaluate
       and analyze available information to arrive at rational decisions. Although
       rational investors may use the same information to arrive at different esti-
       mates of expected risk and expected returns, homogeneity among investors
       (see Assumption 4) requires that investors be rational individuals.
       Risk aversion and utility maximization are generally accepted as reflecting a
       realistic view of the world. Yet, rationality among investors has been ques-
       tioned because investors may allow their personal biases and experiences
       to disrupt their decision making, resulting in suboptimal investments.
       Nonetheless, the model’s results are unaffected by such irrational behavior
       as long as it does not affect prices in a significant manner (i.e., the trades
       of irrational investors cancel each other or are dominated by the trades of
       rational investors).
   2. Markets are frictionless, including no transaction costs and no taxes.
       Frictionless markets allow us to abstract the analysis from the operational
       characteristics of markets. In doing so, we do not allow the risk–return
       relationship to be affected by, for example, the trading volume on the New
       York Stock Exchange or the difference between buying and selling prices.
       Specifically, frictionless markets do not have transaction costs, taxes, or any
       costs or restrictions on short selling. We also assume that borrowing and
       lending at the risk-free rate is possible.
       The transaction costs of many large institutions are negligible, and many
       institutions do not pay taxes. Even the presence of non-zero transac-
       tion costs, taxes, or the inability to borrow at the risk-free rate does not

                                materially affect the general conclusions of the CAPM. Costs of short selling
                                or restrictions on short selling, however, can introduce an upward bias in
                                asset prices, potentially jeopardizing important conclusions of the CAPM.
                             3. Investors plan for the same single holding period.
                                The CAPM is a single-period model, and all investor decisions are made on
                                the basis of that one period. The assumption of a single period is applied
                                for convenience because working with multi-period models is more dif-
                                ficult. A single-period model, however, does not allow learning to occur,
                                and bad decisions can persist. In addition, maximizing utility at the end
                                of a multi-period horizon may require decisions in certain periods that
                                may seem suboptimal when examined from a single-period perspective.
                                Nonetheless, the single holding period does not severely limit the applicabil-
                                ity of the CAPM to multi-period settings.
                             4. Investors have homogeneous expectations or beliefs.
                                This assumption means that all investors analyze securities in the same way
                                using the same probability distributions and the same inputs for future cash
                                flows. In addition, given that they are rational individuals, the investors
                                will arrive at the same valuations. Because their valuations of all assets are
                                identical, they will generate the same optimal risky portfolio, which we call
                                the market portfolio.
                                The assumption of homogeneous beliefs can be relaxed as long as the dif-
                                ferences in expectations do not generate significantly different optimal risky
                                portfolios.
                             5. All investments are infinitely divisible.
                                This assumption implies that an individual can invest as little or as much as
                                he or she wishes in an asset. This supposition allows the model to rely on
                                continuous functions rather than on discrete jump functions. The assump-
                                tion is made for convenience only and has an inconsequential impact on the
                                conclusions of the model.
                             6. Investors are price takers.
                                The CAPM assumes that there are many investors and that no investor is
                                large enough to influence prices. Thus, investors are price takers, and we
                                assume that security prices are unaffected by investor trades. This assump-
                                tion is generally true because even though investors may be able to affect
                                prices of small stocks, those stocks are not large enough to affect the pri-
                                mary results of the CAPM.


                             The main objective of these assumptions is to create a marginal investor who
                         rationally chooses a mean–variance-efficient portfolio in a predictable fashion. We
                         assume away any inefficiency in the market from both operational and informational
                         perspectives. Although some of these assumptions may seem unrealistic, relaxing most
                         of them will have only a minor influence on the model and its results. Moreover, the
                         CAPM, with all its limitations and weaknesses, provides a benchmark for comparison
                         and for generating initial return estimates.


                         The Security Market Line
                         In this subsection, we apply the CAPM to the pricing of securities. The security market
                         line (SML) is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model with beta,
                         reflecting systematic risk, on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis. Using the
                         same concept as the capital market line, the SML intersects the y-axis at the risk-free

rate of return, and the slope of this line is the market risk premium, Rm – Rf. Recall
that the capital market line (CML) does not apply to all securities or assets but only
to portfolios on the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier gives optimal combinations
of expected return and total risk. In contrast, the security market line applies to any
security, efficient or not. Total risk and systematic risk are equal only for efficient
portfolios because those portfolios have no diversifiable risk remaining.
    Exhibit 7 is a graphical representation of the CAPM, the security market line. As
shown earlier in this reading, the beta of the market is 1 (x-axis) and the market earns
an expected return of Rm (y-axis). Using this line, it is possible to calculate the expected
return of an asset. The next example illustrates the beta and return calculations.

                                    E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.03 + 0 × (0.13 – 0.03) = 0.03 = 3.0%
                                   Because of its zero correlation with the market portfolio, Bajaj Auto’s beta is
                                   zero. Because the beta is zero, the expected return for Bajaj Auto is the risk-
                                   free rate, which is 3 percent.

                              2. Suppose the risk-free rate is 3 percent, the expected return on the market
                                 portfolio is 13 percent, and its standard deviation is 23 percent. A German

                                    E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.03 + 1.41× (0.13 – 0.03) = 0.171 = 17.1%
                                   Because of the high degree of correlation with the market, the beta for
                                   Mueller Metals is 1.41 and the expected return is 17.1 percent. Because
                                   Mueller Metals has systematic risk that is greater than that of the market, it
                                   has an expected return that exceeds the expected return of the market.


                         Portfolio Beta
                         As we stated above, the security market line applies to all securities. But what about
                         a combination of securities, such as a portfolio? Consider two securities, 1 and 2,
                         with a weight of wi in Security 1 and the balance in Security 2. The return for the two
                         securities and return of the portfolio can be written as:

                                                                                                                 ​ ​)​​− R

                         The last equation gives the expression for the portfolio’s expected return. From this
                         equation, we can conclude that the portfolio’s beta = w1β1 + w2β2. In general, the port-
                         folio beta is a weighted sum of the betas of the component securities and is given by:
                                           n                  n

                         The portfolio’s return given by the CAPM is
                               E(Rp) = Rf + βp[E(Rm) – Rf]
                         This equation shows that a linear relationship exists between the expected return of
                         a portfolio and the systematic risk of the portfolio as measured by βp.

   Portfolio Beta and Return

   1. You invest 20 percent of your money in the risk-free asset, 30 percent in
      the market portfolio, and 50 percent in RedHat, a US stock that has a beta
      of 2.0. Given that the risk-free rate is 4 percent and the market return is 16
      percent, what are the portfolio’s beta and expected return?

   Solution:
      The beta of the risk-free asset = 0, the beta of the market = 1, and the beta of
      RedHat is 2.0. The portfolio beta is
      βp = w1β1 + w2β2 + w3β3 = (0.20 × 0.0) + (0.30 × 1.0) + (0.50 × 2.0) = 1.30

      E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf] = 0.04 + 1.30 × (0.16 – 0.04) = 0.196 = 19.6%
      The portfolio beta is 1.30, and its expected return is 19.6 percent.

   Alternate Method:
      Another method for calculating the portfolio’s return is to calculate individ-
      ual security returns and then use the portfolio return formula (i.e., weighted
      average of security returns) to calculate the overall portfolio return.
      Return of the risk-free asset = 4 percent; return of the market = 16 percent

      RedHat’s return based on its beta = 0.04 + 2.0 × (0.16 – 0.04) = 0.28

      Portfolio return = (0.20 × 0.04) + (0.30 × 0.16) + (0.50 × 0.28) = 0.196
      = 19.6%
      Not surprisingly, the portfolio return is 19.6 percent, as calculated in the
      first method.

The CAPM offers powerful and intuitively appealing predictions about risk and
the relationship between risk and return. The CAPM is not only important from a
theoretical perspective but is also used extensively in practice. In this section, we
will discuss some common applications of the model. When applying these tools to
different scenarios, it is important to understand that the CAPM and the SML are
functions that give an indication of what the return in the market should be, given a
certain level of risk. The actual return may be quite different from the expected return.

                             Applications of the CAPM include estimates of the expected return for capital
                         budgeting, comparison of the actual return of a portfolio or portfolio manager with
                         the CAPM return for performance appraisal, and the analysis of alternate return
                         estimates and the CAPM returns as the basis for security selection. The applications
                         are discussed in more detail in this section.


                         Estimate of Expected Return
                         Given an asset’s systematic risk, the expected return can be calculated using the
                         CAPM. Recall that the price of an asset is the sum of all future cash flows discounted
                         at the required rate of return, where the discount rate or the required rate of return
                         is commensurate with the asset’s risk. The expected rate of return obtained from
                         the CAPM is normally the first estimate that investors use for valuing assets, such
                         as stocks, bonds, real estate, and other similar assets. The required rate of return
                         from the CAPM is also used for capital budgeting and determining the economic
                         feasibility of projects. Again, recall that when computing the net present value of a
                         project, investments and net revenues are considered cash flows and are discounted
                         at the required rate of return. The required rate of return, based on the project’s risk,
                         is calculated using the CAPM.
                              Because risk and return underlie almost all aspects of investment decision making,
                         it is not surprising that the CAPM is used for estimating expected return in many sce-
                         narios. Other examples include calculating the cost of capital for regulated companies
                         by regulatory commissions and setting fair insurance premiums. The next example
                         shows an application of the CAPM to capital budgeting.

                          EXAMPLE 9

                            Application of the CAPM to Capital Budgeting
                            GlaxoSmithKline Plc is examining the economic feasibility of developing a new
                            medicine. The initial investment in Year 1 is $500 million. The investment in
                            Year 2 is $200 million. There is a 50 percent chance that the medicine will be
                            developed and will be successful. If that happens, GlaxoSmithKline must spend
                            another $100 million in Year 3, but its income from the project in Year 3 will
                            be $500 million, not including the third-year investment. In Years 4, 5, and 6,
                            it will earn $400 million a year if the medicine is successful. At the end of Year
                            6, it intends to sell all rights to the medicine for $600 million. If the medicine is
                            unsuccessful, none of GlaxoSmithKline’s investments can be salvaged. Assume
                            that the market return is 12 percent, the risk-free rate is 2 percent, and the beta
                            risk of the project is 2.3. All cash flows occur at the end of each year.

                            1. Calculate the expected annual cash flows using the probability of success.

                            Solution:
                               There is a 50 percent chance that the cash flows in Years 3–6 will occur.
                               Taking that into account, the expected annual cash flows are:
                                Year 1: –$500 million (outflow)

  2. Calculate the expected return.

  Solution:
      The expected or required return for the project can be calculated using the
      CAPM, which is = 0.02 + 2.3 × (0.12 – 0.02) = 0.25.

  3. Calculate the net present value.

  Solution:
      The net present value is the discounted value of all cash flows:
                        T     C ​Ft​​
              ​ ​_t ​

    = − 400 − 128 + 102.40 + 81.92 + 65.54 + 131.07 = − 147.07.
      Because the net present value is negative (–$147.07 million), the project
      should not be accepted by GlaxoSmithKline.




BEYOND CAPM: LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF
CAPM                                                                                           10
                    describe and demonstrate applications of the CAPM and the SML

In general, return-generating models allow us to estimate an asset’s return given its
characteristics, where the asset characteristics required for estimating the return
are specified in the model. Estimating an asset’s return is important for investment
decision making. These models are also important as a benchmark for evaluating
portfolio, security, or manager performance. The return-generating models were
briefly introduced in Section 3.2.1, and one of those models, the capital asset pricing
model, was discussed in detail in Section 4.
    The purpose of this section is to make readers aware that, although the CAPM is
an important concept and model, the CAPM is not the only return-generating model.
In this section, we revisit and highlight the limitations of the CAPM and preview
return-generating models that address some of those limitations.


Limitations of the CAPM
The CAPM is subject to theoretical and practical limitations. Theoretical limitations
are inherent in the structure of the model, whereas practical limitations are those that
arise in implementing the model.

                         Theoretical Limitations of the CAPM

                             ■   Single-factor model: Only systematic risk or beta risk is priced in the
                                 CAPM. Thus, the CAPM states that no other investment characteristics
                                 should be considered in estimating returns. As a consequence, it is prescrip-
                                 tive and easy to understand and apply, although it is very restrictive and
                                 inflexible.
                             ■   Single-period model: The CAPM is a single-period model that does not con-
                                 sider multi-period implications or investment objectives of future periods,
                                 which can lead to myopic and suboptimal investment decisions. For exam-
                                 ple, it may be optimal to default on interest payments in the current period
                                 to maximize current returns, but the consequences may be negative in the
                                 next period. A single-period model like the CAPM is unable to capture fac-
                                 tors that vary over time and span several periods.


                         Practical Limitations of the CAPM
                         In addition to the theoretical limitations, implementation of the CAPM raises several
                         practical concerns, some of which are listed below.
                             ■   Market portfolio: The true market portfolio according to the CAPM
                                 includes all assets, financial and nonfinancial, which means that it also
                                 includes many assets that are not investable, such as human capital and
                                 assets in closed economies. Richard Roll3 noted that one reason the CAPM
                                 is not testable is that the true market portfolio is unobservable.
                             ■   Proxy for a market portfolio: In the absence of a true market portfolio, mar-
                                 ket participants generally use proxies. These proxies, however, vary among
                                 analysts, the country of the investor, etc. and generate different return esti-
                                 mates for the same asset, which is impermissible in the CAPM.
                             ■   Estimation of beta risk: A long history of returns (three to five years) is
                                 required to estimate beta risk. The historical state of the company, how-
                                 ever, may not be an accurate representation of the current or future state
                                 of the company. More generally, the CAPM is an ex ante model, yet it is
                                 usually applied using ex post data. In addition, using different periods for
                                 estimation results in different estimates of beta. For example, a three-year
                                 beta is unlikely to be the same as a five-year beta, and a beta estimated with
                                 daily returns is unlikely to be the same as the beta estimated with monthly
                                 returns. Thus, we are likely to estimate different returns for the same asset
                                 depending on the estimate of beta risk used in the model.
                             ■   The CAPM is a poor predictor of returns: If the CAPM is a good model, its
                                 estimate of asset returns should be closely associated with realized returns.
                                 However, empirical support for the CAPM is weak.4 In other words, tests
                                 of the CAPM show that asset returns are not determined only by systematic
                                 risk. Poor predictability of returns when using the CAPM is a serious limita-
                                 tion because return-generating models are used to estimate future returns.
                             ■   Homogeneity in investor expectations: The CAPM assumes that homogene-
                                 ity exists in investor expectations for the model to generate a single optimal
                                 risky portfolio (the market) and a single security market line. Without this
                                 assumption, there will be numerous optimal risky portfolios and numerous
                                 security market lines. Clearly, investors can process the same information in
                                 a rational manner and arrive at different optimal risky portfolios.

Beyond CAPM: Limitations and Extensions of CAPM                                                              95



Extensions to the CAPM
Given the limitations of the CAPM, it is not surprising that other models have been
proposed to address some of these limitations. These new models are not without
limitations of their own, which we will mention while discussing the models. We
divide the models into two categories—theoretical models and practical models—and
provide one example of each type.

Theoretical Models
Theoretical models are based on the same principle as the CAPM but expand the
number of risk factors. The best example of a theoretical model is the arbitrage pricing
theory (APT), which was developed by Stephen Ross.5 Like the CAPM, APT proposes
a linear relationship between expected return and risk:
    E(Rp) = RF + λ1βp,1 + ... + λKβp,K
where

    E(Rp) = the expected return of portfolio p

        RF = the risk-free rate

         λj = the risk premium (expected return in excess of the risk-free rate) for fac-
              tor j

       βp,j = the sensitivity of the portfolio to factor j

         K = the number of risk factors
    Unlike the CAPM, however, APT allows numerous risk factors—as many as are
relevant to a particular asset. Moreover, other than the risk-free rate, the risk factors
need not be common and may vary from one asset to another. A no-arbitrage con-
dition in asset markets is used to determine the risk factors and estimate betas for
the risk factors.
    Although it is theoretically elegant, flexible, and superior to the CAPM, APT is
not commonly used in practice because it does not specify any of the risk factors
and it becomes difficult to identify risk factors and estimate betas for each asset in a
portfolio. So from a practical standpoint, the CAPM is preferred to APT.

Practical Models
If beta risk in the CAPM does not explain returns, which factors do? Practical models
seek to answer this question through extensive research. As mentioned in Section
3.2.1, the best example of such a model is the four-factor model proposed by Fama
and French (1992) and Carhart (1997).
    Based on an analysis of the relationship between past returns and a variety of
different factors, Fama and French (1992) proposed that three factors seem to explain
asset returns better than just systematic risk. Those three factors are relative size,
relative book-to-market value, and beta of the asset. With Carhart’s (1997) addition
of relative past stock returns, the model can be written as follows:
    	​E​(​ ​Rit​ ​)​​ = ​α​i​+ ​βi,MKT
                                 ​     ​MK ​Tt​​+ β​ i,SMB
                                                     ​     ​SM B
                                                               ​ t​​+ ​βi,HML
                                                                        ​     ​HM L
                                                                                  ​ t​​+ ​βi,UMD
                                                                                           ​     ​UM ​Dt​​

                             where

                             E(Ri) = the return on an asset in excess of the one-month T-bill return

                             MKT = the excess return on the market portfolio

                              SMB = the difference in returns between small-capitalization stocks and
                                    large-capitalization stocks (size)

                             HML = the difference in returns between high-book-to-market stocks and
                                   low-book-to-market stocks (value versus growth)

                             UMD = the difference in returns of the prior year’s winners and losers
                                   (momentum)
                             Historical analysis shows that the coefficient on MKT is not significantly different
                         from zero, which implies that stock return is unrelated to the market. The factors
                         that explain stock returns are size (smaller companies outperform larger companies),
                         book-to-market ratio (value companies outperform glamour companies), and momen-
                         tum (past winners outperform past losers).
                             The four-factor model has been found to predict asset returns much better than
                         the CAPM and is extensively used in estimating returns for US stocks.
                             Two observations are in order. First, the model is not underpinned by a theory of
                         market equilibrium, as is the case for the CAPM. Second, there is no assurance that
                         the model will continue to work well in the future.

                         In the investment industry, performance evaluation refers to the measurement,
                         attribution, and appraisal of investment results. In particular, performance evaluation
                         provides information about the return and risk of investment portfolios over specified
                         investment period(s). By providing accurate data and analysis on investment decisions
                         and their consequences, performance evaluation allows portfolio managers to take
                         corrective measures to improve investment decision-making and management pro-
                         cesses. Performance evaluation information helps in understanding and controlling
                         investment risk and should, therefore, lead to improved risk management. Performance
                         evaluation seeks to answer the following questions:
                             ■   What was the investment portfolio’s past performance, and what may be
                                 expected in the future?
                           Answering this question is the subject of performance measurement. Performance
                         measurement is concerned with the measurement of return and risk.
                             ■   How did the investment portfolio produce its observed performance, and
                                 what are the expected sources of expected future performance?

Portfolio Performance Appraisal Measures                                                       97


    Answering this question is the subject of performance attribution. Performance
attribution is concerned with identifying and quantifying the sources of performance
of a portfolio.
    ■   Was the observed investment portfolio’s performance the result of invest-
        ment skill or luck?
    Answering this question is the subject of performance appraisal. Performance
appraisal is concerned with identifying and measuring investment skill.
    The information provided by performance evaluation is of great interest to all
stakeholders in the investment management process because of its value in evaluat-
ing the overall quality of the investment management process as well as individual
investment decisions.
    In this reading, performance appraisal is based only on the CAPM. However, it is
easy to extend this analysis to multi-factor models that may include industry or other
special factors. Four ratios are commonly used in performance appraisal.


The Sharpe Ratio
Performance has two components, risk and return. Although return maximization is
a laudable objective, comparing just the return of a portfolio with that of the market
is not sufficient. Because investors are risk averse, they will require compensation for
higher risk in the form of higher returns. A commonly used measure of performance
is the Sharpe ratio, which is defined as the portfolio’s risk premium divided by its
risk. An appealing feature of the Sharpe ratio is that its use can be justified on a the-
oretical ex ante (before the fact) basis and ex post (after the fact) values can easily be
determined by using readily available market data. The Sharpe ratio is also easy to
interpret, essentially being an efficiency ratio relating reward to risks taken. It is the
most widely recognized and used appraisal measure.
    The equation below defines the ex ante Sharpe ratio in terms of three inputs: (1)
the portfolio’s expected return, E(Rp); (2) the risk-free rate of interest, Rf; and (3) the
portfolio’s ex ante standard deviation of returns (return volatility), σp, a quantitative
measure of total risk.
            E​(
              ​ ​Rp​ ​)​​− ​RF​ ​
   	​SR = _
          ​ ​σ​p​ ​

The Sharpe ratio can also be used on an ex post basis to evaluate historical risk-adjusted
returns. Assume we have a sample_of historical data that can be used to determine
the sample mean portfolio return, ​R ​p​; the standard deviation of the sample returns,
here denoted by_ ​σˆ​p​(sp is a familiar notation in other contexts); and the sample mean
risk-free rate, ​R ​f​. The ex post (or realized or historical) Sharpe ratio can then be
determined by using the following:
           _         _
     ˆ​ = ​
          ​R ​p​− ​R ​F​
          _
   	​SR        ​σˆ​p​ ​

Recalling the CAL from earlier in the reading, one can see that the Sharpe ratio, also
called the reward-to-variability ratio, is simply the slope of the capital allocation line.
Note, however, that the ratio uses the total risk of the portfolio, not its systematic risk.
The use of total risk is appropriate if the portfolio is an investor’s total portfolio—that
is, the investor does not own any other assets. Sharpe ratios of the market and other
portfolios can also be calculated in a similar manner. The portfolio with the highest
Sharpe ratio has the best risk-adjusted performance, and the one with the lowest
Sharpe ratio has the worst risk-adjusted performance, provided that the numerator
is positive for all comparison portfolios. If the numerator is negative, the ratio will be

                             The Sharpe ratio, however, suffers from two limitations. First, it uses total risk as
                         a measure of risk when only systematic risk is priced. Second, the ratio itself (e.g.,
                         0.2 or 0.3) is not informative. To rank portfolios, the Sharpe ratio of one portfolio
                         must be compared with the Sharpe ratio of another portfolio. Nonetheless, the ease
                         of computation makes the Sharpe ratio a popular tool.


                         The Treynor Ratio
                         The Treynor ratio is a simple extension of the Sharpe ratio and resolves the Sharpe
                         ratio’s first limitation by substituting beta (systematic risk) for total risk. The ex ante
                         and ex post Treynor ratios are provided below.

                         Just like the Sharpe ratio, the numerators must be positive for the Treynor ratio to
                         give meaningful results. In addition, the Treynor ratio does not work for negative-beta
                         assets—that is, the denominator must also be positive for obtaining correct estimates
                         and rankings. Although both the Sharpe and Treynor ratios allow for ranking of portfo-
                         lios, neither ratio gives any information about the economic significance of differences
                         in performance. For example, assume the Sharpe ratio of one portfolio is 0.75 and the
                         Sharpe ratio for another portfolio is 0.80. The second portfolio is superior, but is that
                         difference meaningful? In addition, we do not know whether either of the portfolios
                         is better than the passive market portfolio. The remaining two measures, M2 and
                         Jensen’s alpha, attempt to address that problem by comparing portfolios while also
                         providing information about the extent of the overperformance or underperformance.


                         M2: Risk-Adjusted Performance (RAP)
                         M2 provides a measure of portfolio return that is adjusted for the total risk of the
                         portfolio relative to that of some benchmark. In 1997, Nobel Prize winner Franco
                         Modigliani and his granddaughter, Leah Modigliani, developed what they called a
                         risk-adjusted performance measure, or RAP. The RAP measure has since become
                         more commonly known as M2 reflecting the Modigliani names. It is related to the
                         Sharpe ratio and ranks portfolios identically, but it has the useful advantage of being
                         denominated in familiar terms of percentage return advantage assuming the same
                         level of total risk as the market.
                             M2 borrows from capital market theory by assuming a portfolio is leveraged or
                         de-leveraged until its volatility (as measured by standard deviation) matches that of
                         the market. This adjustment produces a portfolio-specific leverage ratio that equates
                         the portfolio’s risk to that of the market. The portfolio’s excess return times the lever-
                         age ratio plus the risk-free rate is then compared with the markets actual return to
                         determine whether the portfolio has outperformed or underperformed the market
                         on a risk-adjusted basis.
                             The equations below provide the ex ante and ex post formulas for M2, where σm
                         is the standard deviation of the market portfolio and σm/σp is the portfolio-specific
                         leverage ratio. Because the Sharpe ratio is defined as

the equation shows that M2 can be thought of as a rescaling of the Sharpe ratio that
allows for easier comparisons among different portfolios. The reason that M2 and
Sharpe ratios rank portfolios identically is because, in a given time period—and for
any given comparison of the market portfolio—both the risk-free rate and the mar-
ket volatility are constant across all comparisons. Only the Sharpe ratio differs, so it
determines all rankings.

For example, assume that ​R ​f​ = 4.0%, ​R ​p​ = 14.0%, ​σˆ​p​ = 25.0% and ​σˆ​m​ = 20.0%. The

                     M​2​= 0.4(0.2) + 0.04 = 0.12 = 12.0%. If the market return was 10%,
then the portfolio outperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis by 12.0% − 10.0%
= 2.0%. This difference between the risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio and
the performance of the market is frequently referred to as M2 alpha.
    The Sharpe ratio of the market portfolio is

   	​ˆ
             0.10 − 0.04
     SR​ = _
           ​ 0.20 ​

     = 0.3. Comparing the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio with the Sharpe ratio of the
market portfolio shows that the fund outperformed the market. But the 2.0% differ-
ence between M2 and the market’s return tells us the risk-adjusted outperformance
as a percentage return.


Jensen’s Alpha
Like the Treynor ratio, Jensen’s alpha is based on systematic risk. We can measure a
portfolio’s systematic risk by estimating the market model, which is done by regress-
ing the portfolio’s daily return on the market’s daily return. The coefficient on the
market return is an estimate of the beta risk of the portfolio. We can calculate the
risk-adjusted return of the portfolio using the beta of the portfolio and the CAPM.
The difference between the actual portfolio return and the calculated risk-adjusted
return is a measure of the portfolio’s performance relative to the market portfolio and
is called Jensen’s alpha. By definition, αm of the market is zero. Jensen’s alpha is also
the vertical distance from the SML measuring the excess return for the same risk as
that of the market and is given by
   αp = Rp – {Rf + βp[E(Rm)– Rf]}
If the period is long, it may contain different risk-free rates, in which case Rf represents
the average risk-free rate. Furthermore, the returns in the equation are all realized,
actual returns. The sign of αp indicates whether the portfolio has outperformed the
market. If αp is positive, then the portfolio has outperformed the market; if αp is
negative, the portfolio has underperformed the market. Jensen’s alpha is commonly
used for evaluating most institutional managers, pension funds, and mutual funds.
Values of alpha can be used to rank different managers and the performance of their
portfolios, as well as the magnitude of underperformance or overperformance. For
example, if a portfolio’s alpha is 2 percent and another portfolio’s alpha is 5 percent,
the second portfolio has outperformed the first portfolio by 3 percentage points and
the market by 5 percentage points. Jensen’s alpha is the maximum amount that you
should be willing to pay the manager to manage your money. As with other perfor-
mance appraisal measures, Jensen’s alpha has ex ante and ex post forms. The use

                          context usually clarifies which one is being referred to. Where we want to underscore

          Let us begin with an analysis of the risk-free asset. Because the risk-free
          asset has zero risk and a beta of zero, calculating the Sharpe ratio, Treynor
          ratio, or M2 is not possible because they all require the portfolio risk in the
          denominator. The risk-free asset’s alpha, however, is zero. Turning to the
          market portfolio, we see that the absolute measures of performance, the
          Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio, are positive for the market portfolio.
          These ratios are positive as long as the portfolio earns a return that is in ex-
                                                ˆ ​and ​αˆ​i​are performance measures rela-
                                                 2
          cess of that of the risk-free asset. ​M​
          tive to the market, so they are both equal to zero for the market portfolio.
          All three managers have Sharpe and Treynor ratios greater than those of the
          market, and all three managers’ M2 alpha and αi are positive; therefore, the
          pension fund should be satisfied with their performance. Among the three
          managers, Manager X has the worst performance, irrespective of whether
          total risk or systematic risk is considered for measuring performance. The
          relative rankings are depicted in Exhibit 9.

          Comparing Y and Z, we can observe that Y performs much better than Z
          when total risk is considered. Y has a Sharpe ratio of 0.80, compared with a
          Sharpe ratio of 0.36 for Z. Similarly, M2 alpha is higher for Y (9.20 percent)
          than for Z (0.84 percent). In contrast, when systematic risk is used, Z out-
          performs Y. The Treynor ratio is higher for Z (0.150) than for Y (0.114), and
          Jensen’s alpha is also higher for Z (5.40 percent) than for Y (3.80 percent),
          which indicates that Z has done a better job of generating excess return
          relative to systematic risk than Y.
          Exhibit 10 confirms these observations in that all three managers outper-
          form the benchmark because all three points lie above the SML. Among the
          three portfolios, Z performs the best when we consider risk-adjusted returns
          because it is the point in Exhibit 10 that is located northwest relative to the
          portfolios X and Y.

                                  When do we use total risk performance measures like the Sharpe ratio and
                                  M2, and when do we use beta risk performance measures like the Treynor
                                  ratio and Jensen’s alpha? Total risk is relevant for an investor when he or she
                                  holds a portfolio that is not fully diversified, which is not a desirable port-
                                  folio. In such cases, the Sharpe ratio and M2 are appropriate performance
                                  measures. Thus, if the pension fund were to choose only one fund manager
                                  to manage all its assets, it should choose Manager Y. Performance measures
                                  relative to beta risk—Treynor ratio and Jensen’s alpha—are relevant when
                                  the investor holds a well-diversified portfolio with negligible diversifiable
                                  risk. In other words, if the pension fund is well diversified and only the sys-
                                  tematic risk of the portfolio matters, the fund should choose Manager Z.

                              The measures of performance evaluation assume that the market portfolio is the
                          correct benchmark. As a result, an error in the benchmark may cause the results
                          to be misleading. For example, evaluating a real estate fund against the S&P 500 is
                          incorrect because real estate has different characteristics than equity. In addition to
                          errors in benchmarking, errors could occur in the measurement of risk and return of
                          the market portfolio and the portfolios being evaluated. Finally, many estimates are
                          based on historical data. Any projections based on such estimates assume that this
                          level of performance will continue in the future.

Applications of the CAPM in Portfolio Construction                                           103


This section introduces applications of the CAPM in portfolio construction. First,
the security characteristic line, which graphically indicates ex post Jensen’s alpha,
is described. If we relax the assumption that investors have the same expectations
about risk and return, a positive Jensen’s alpha can be interpreted as an indication of
superior information or investment ability. The section on security selection covers
that possibility. The last section summarizes how the CAPM and related concepts can
be applied to portfolio construction.


Security Characteristic Line
Similar to the SML, we can draw a security characteristic line (SCL) for a security.
The SCL is a plot of the excess return of the security on the excess return of the market.
In Exhibit 8, Jensen’s alpha is the intercept and the beta is the slope. The equation of
the line can be obtained by rearranging the terms in the expression for Jensen’s alpha
and replacing the subscript p with i:
           Ri – Rf = αi + βi(Rm – Rf)
As an example, the SCL is drawn in Exhibit 11 using Manager X’s portfolio from
Exhibit 8. The security characteristic line can also be estimated by regressing the
excess security return, Ri – Rf, on the excess market return, Rm – Rf.

Security Selection
When discussing the CAPM, we assumed that investors have homogeneous expecta-
tions and are rational, risk-averse, utility-maximizing investors. With these assump-
tions, we were able to state that all investors assign the same value to all assets and,
therefore, have the same optimal risky portfolio, which is the market portfolio. In
other words, we assumed that there is commonality among beliefs about an asset’s

                          future cash flows and the required rate of return. Given the required rate of return,
                          we can discount the future cash flows of the asset to arrive at its current value, or
                          price, which is agreed upon by all or most investors.
                              In this section, we introduce heterogeneity in beliefs of investors. Because inves-
                          tors are price takers, it is assumed that such heterogeneity does not significantly
                          affect the market price of an asset. The difference in beliefs can relate to future cash
                          flows, the systematic risk of the asset, or both. Because the current price of an asset
                          is the discounted value of the future cash flows, the difference in beliefs could result
                          in an investor-estimated price that is different from the CAPM-calculated price. The
                          CAPM-calculated price is the current market price because it reflects the beliefs of all
                          other investors in the market. If the investor-estimated current price is higher (lower)
                          than the market price, the asset is considered undervalued (overvalued). Therefore,
                          the CAPM is an effective tool for determining whether an asset is undervalued or
                          overvalued and whether an investor should buy or sell the asset.
                              Although portfolio performance evaluation is backward looking and security selec-
                          tion is forward looking, we can apply the concepts of portfolio evaluation to security
                          selection. The best measure to apply is Jensen’s alpha because it uses systematic risk
                          and is meaningful even on an absolute basis. A positive Jensen’s alpha indicates a
                          superior security, whereas a negative Jensen’s alpha indicates a security that is likely
                          to underperform the market when adjusted for risk.
                              Another way of presenting the same information is with the security market line.
                          Potential investors can plot a security’s expected return and beta against the SML
                          and use this relationship to decide whether the security is overvalued or undervalued
                          in the market.6 Exhibit 12 shows a number of securities along with the SML. All
                          securities that reflect the consensus market view are points directly on the SML (i.e.,
                          properly valued). If a point representing the estimated return of an asset is above
                          the SML (Points A and C), the asset has a low level of risk relative to the amount of
                          expected return and would be a good choice for investment. In contrast, if the point
                          representing a particular asset is below the SML (Point B), the stock is considered
                          overvalued. Its return does not compensate for the level of risk and should not be
                          considered for investment. Of course, a short position in Asset B can be taken if short
                          selling is permitted.

                          considered in relation to transaction costs prior to making an investment decision.

Implications of the CAPM for Portfolio Construction
Based on the CAPM, investors should hold a combination of the risk-free asset and the
market portfolio. The true market portfolio consists of a large number of securities,
and an investor would have to own all of them in order to be completely diversified.
Because owning all existing securities is not practical, in this section, we will consider
an alternate method of constructing a portfolio that may not require a large number
of securities and will still be sufficiently diversified. Exhibit 13 shows the reduction
in risk as we add more and more securities to a portfolio. As can be seen from the
exhibit, much of the nonsystematic risk can be diversified away in as few as 30 secu-
rities. These securities, however, should be randomly selected and represent different
asset classes for the portfolio to effectively diversify risk. Otherwise, one may be better
off using an index (e.g., the S&P 500 for a diversified large-cap equity portfolio and
other indexes for other asset classes).

                          Let’s begin constructing the optimal portfolio with a portfolio of securities like the
                          S&P 500. Although the S&P 500 is a portfolio of 500 securities, it is a good starting
                          point because it is readily available as a single security for trading. In contrast, it
                          represents only the large corporations that are traded on the US stock markets and,
                          therefore, does not encompass the global market entirely. Because the S&P 500 is the
                          base portfolio, however, we treat it is as the market for the CAPM.
                              Any security not included in the S&P 500 can be evaluated to determine whether it
                          should be integrated into the portfolio. That decision is based on the αi of the security,
                          which is calculated using the CAPM with the S&P 500 as the market portfolio. Note
                          that security i may not necessarily be priced incorrectly for it to have a non-zero αi;
                          αi can be positive merely because it is not well correlated with the S&P 500 and its
                          return is sufficient for the amount of systematic risk it contains. For example, assume
                          a new stock market, ABC, opens to foreign investors only and is being considered for
                          inclusion in the portfolio. We estimate ABC’s model parameters relative to the S&P
                          500 and find an αi of approximately 3 percent, with a βi of 0.60. Because αi is positive,
                          ABC should be added to the portfolio. Securities with a significantly negative αi may
                          be short sold to maximize risk-adjusted return. For convenience, however, we will
                          assume that negative positions are not permitted in the portfolio.
                              In addition to the securities that are correctly priced but enter the portfolio because
                          of their risk–return superiority, securities already in the portfolio (S&P 500) may be
                          undervalued or overvalued based on investor expectations that are incongruent with
                          the market. Securities in the S&P 500 that are overvalued (negative αi) should be
                          dropped from the S&P 500 portfolio, if it is possible to exclude individual securities,
                          and positions in securities in the S&P 500 that are undervalued (positive αi) should
                          be increased.
                              This brings us to the next question: What should the relative weight of securities
                          in the portfolio be? Because we are concerned with maximizing risk-adjusted return,
                          securities with a higher αi should have a higher weight, and securities with greater
                          nonsystematic risk should be given less weight in the portfolio. A complete analysis
                          of portfolio optimization is beyond the scope of this reading, but the following

principles are helpful. The weight in each nonmarket security should be proportional
    ​α​​
to _
   ​ 2i ​, where the denominator is the nonsystematic variance of security i. The total
  ​σ​ei​
weight of nonmarket securities in the portfolio is proportional to

          ​ ​i​

   	​ N               ​.

                                ​α​​
   The information ratio, _
                          ​​σ​i ​​(i.e., alpha divided by nonsystematic risk), measures the
                                 ei
abnormal return per unit of risk added by the security to a well-diversified portfolio.
The larger the information ratio is, the more valuable the security.

EXAMPLE 11

  Optimal Investor Portfolio with Heterogeneous Beliefs
  A Japanese investor is holding the Nikkei 225 index, which is her version of the
  market. She thinks that three stocks, P, Q, and R, which are not in the Nikkei
  225, are undervalued and should form a part of her portfolio. She has the fol-
  lowing information about the stocks, the Nikkei 225, and the risk-free rate (the
  information is given as expected return, standard deviation, and beta):


            P: 15%, 30%, 1.5

            Q: 18%, 25%, 1.2

            R: 16%, 23%, 1.1

            Nikkei 225: 12%, 18%, 1.0

            Risk-free rate: 2%, 0%, 0.0



  1. Calculate Jensen’s alpha for P, Q, and R.

  Solution:
           Stock P’s α: Ri – [Rf + βi(Rm – Rf)] = 0.15 – (0.02 + 1.5 × 0.10) = –0.02

           Stock Q’s α: Ri – [Rf + βi(Rm – Rf)] = 0.18 – (0.02 + 1.2 × 0.10) = 0.04

           Stock R’s α: Ri – [Rf + βi(Rm – Rf)] = 0.16 – (0.02 + 1.1 × 0.10) = 0.03


  2. Calculate nonsystematic variance for P, Q, and R.

  Solution:
           Total variance = Systematic variance + Nonsystematic variance. From Sec-
           tion 3.2.2, we write the equation as ​σ​ei2 ​ = ​σ​i2​​− ​βi​2​​​σm
                                                                             ​2 ​.
           Stock P’s nonsystematic variance = (0.30 × 0.30) – (1.5 × 1.5 × 0.18 × 0.18) =
           0.09 – 0.0729

                                  = 0.0171

                                  Stock Q’s nonsystematic variance = (0.25 × 0.25) – (1.2 × 1.2 × 0.18 × 0.18) =
                                  0.0625 – 0.0467
                                  = 0.0158

                                  Stock R’s nonsystematic variance = (0.23 × 0.23) – (1.1 × 1.1 × 0.18 × 0.18) =
                                  0.0529 – 0.0392
                                  = 0.0137


                             3. Should any of the three stocks be included in the portfolio? If so, which
                                stock should have the highest weight in the portfolio?

                             Solution:
                                  Stock P has a negative α and should not be included in the portfolio, unless
                                  a negative position can be assumed through short selling. Stocks Q and R
                                  have a positive α; therefore, they should be included in the portfolio with
                                  positive weights.

                                   The relative weight of Q is 0.04/0.0158 = 2.53.

                                   The relative weight of R is 0.03/0.0137 = 2.19.
                                  Stock Q will have the largest weight among the nonmarket securities to be
                                  added to the portfolio. In relative terms, the weight of Q will be 15.5 percent
                                  greater than the weight of R (2.53/2.19 = 1.155). As the number of securities
                                  increases, the analysis becomes more complex. However, the contribution
                                  of each additional security toward improvement in the risk–return trade-
                                  off will decrease and eventually disappear, resulting in a well-diversified
                                  portfolio.




                             SUMMARY
                          In this reading, we discussed the capital asset pricing model in detail and covered
                          related topics such as the capital market line. The reading began with an interpretation
                          of the CML, uses of the market portfolio as a passive management strategy, and lever-
                          aging of the market portfolio to obtain a higher expected return. Next, we discussed
                          systematic and nonsystematic risk and why one should not expect to be compensated
                          for taking on nonsystematic risk. The discussion of systematic and nonsystematic risk
                          was followed by an introduction to beta and return-generating models. This broad
                          topic was then broken down into a discussion of the CAPM and, more specifically, the
                          relationship between beta and expected return. The final section included applications
                          of the CAPM to capital budgeting, portfolio performance evaluation, and security
                          selection. The highlights of the reading are as follows:
                              ■    The capital market line is a special case of the capital allocation line, where
                                   the efficient portfolio is the market portfolio.
                              ■    Obtaining a unique optimal risky portfolio is not possible if investors are
                                   permitted to have heterogeneous beliefs because such beliefs will result in
                                   heterogeneous asset prices.

   ■   Investors can leverage their portfolios by borrowing money and investing in
       the market.
   ■   Systematic risk is the risk that affects the entire market or economy and is
       not diversifiable.
   ■   Nonsystematic risk is local and can be diversified away by combining assets
       with low correlations.
   ■   Beta risk, or systematic risk, is priced and earns a return, whereas nonsys-
       tematic risk is not priced.
   ■   The expected return of an asset depends on its beta risk and can be com-
       puted using the CAPM, which is given by E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf].
   ■   The security market line is an implementation of the CAPM and applies to
       all securities, whether they are efficient or not.
   ■   Expected return from the CAPM can be used for making capital budgeting
       decisions.
   ■   Portfolios can be evaluated by several CAPM-based measures, such as the
       Sharpe ratio, the Treynor ratio, M2, and Jensen’s alpha.
   ■   The SML can assist in security selection and optimal portfolio construction.
    By successfully understanding the content of this reading, you should feel comfort-
able decomposing total variance into systematic and nonsystematic variance, analyzing
beta risk, using the CAPM, and evaluating portfolios and individual securities.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. A capital allocation line (CAL) plots the expected return and total
                             risk of combinations of the risk-free asset and a risky asset (or a portfolio of risky
                             assets).

                          2. B is correct. A portfolio of the risk-free asset and a risky asset or a portfolio of
                             risky assets can result in a better risk-return tradeoff than an investment in only
                             one type of an asset, because the risk-free asset has zero correlation with the
                             risky asset.

                          3. B is correct. Investors will have different optimal portfolios depending on their
                             indifference curves. The optimal portfolio for each investor is the one with high-
                             est utility; that is, where the CAL is tangent to the individual investor’s highest
                             possible indifference curve.

                          4. B is correct. Although the optimal risky portfolio is the market portfolio, highly
                             risk-averse investors choose to invest most of their wealth in the risk-free asset.

                          5. B is correct. Although the capital allocation line includes all possible combina-
                             tions of the risk-free asset and any risky portfolio, the capital market line is a
                             special case of the capital allocation line, which uses the market portfolio as the
                             optimal risky portfolio.

                          6. A is correct. The market includes all risky assets, or anything that has value; how-
                             ever, not all assets are tradable, and not all tradable assets are investable.

                          7. A is correct. The optimal risky portfolio is the market portfolio. Capital market
                             theory assumes that investors have homogeneous expectations, which means that
                             all investors analyze securities in the same way and are rational. That is, investors
                             use the same probability distributions, use the same inputs for future cash flows,
                             and arrive at the same valuations. Because their valuations of all assets are iden-
                             tical, all investors will invest in the same optimal risky portfolio (i.e., the market
                             portfolio).

                          8. C is correct. Theoretically, any point above the CML is not achievable and any
                             point below the CML is dominated by and inferior to any point on the CML.

                          9. B is correct. As one moves further to the right of point M on the capital market
                             line, an increasing amount of borrowed money is being invested in the market
                             portfolio. This means that there is negative investment in the risk-free asset,
                             which is referred to as a leveraged position in the risky portfolio.

                          10. A is correct. The combinations of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio
                              on the CML where returns are less than the returns on the market portfolio are
                              termed ‘lending’ portfolios.

                          11. C is correct. Investors are capable of avoiding nonsystematic risk by forming a
                              portfolio of assets that are not highly correlated with one another, thereby reduc-
                              ing total risk and being exposed only to systematic risk.

                          12. B is correct. Nonsystematic risk is specific to a firm, whereas systematic risk
                              affects the entire economy.

                          13. B is correct. Only systematic risk is priced. Investors do not receive any return for
                              accepting nonsystematic or diversifiable risk.

14. C is correct. The sum of systematic variance and nonsystematic variance equals
    the total variance of the asset. References to total risk as the sum of systematic
    risk and nonsystematic risk refer to variance, not to risk.

15. A is correct. Security 1 has the highest total risk = 0.25 compared to Security 2
    and Security 3 with a total risk of 0.20.

16. C is correct. Security 3 has the highest beta value;

18. B is correct. In the market model, Ri = αi + βiRm + ei, the intercept, αi, and slope
    coefficient, βi, are estimated using historical security and market returns.

19. B is correct. In the market model, Ri = αi + βiRm + ei, the slope coefficient, βi, is
    an estimate of the asset’s systematic or market risk.

20. A is correct. In the market model, Ri = αi + βiRm + ei, the intercept, αi, and slope
    coefficient, βi, are estimated using historical security and market returns. These
    parameter estimates then are used to predict firm-specific returns that a security
    may earn in a future period.

21. B is correct. The average beta of all assets in the market, by definition, is equal to
    1.0.

22. A is correct. The CAPM shows that the primary determinant of expected return
    for an individual asset is its beta, or how well the asset correlates with the market.

23. A is correct. If an asset’s beta is negative, the required return will be less than the
    risk-free rate in the CAPM. When combined with a positive market return, the
    asset reduces the risk of the overall portfolio, which makes the asset very valu-
    able. Insurance is an example of a negative beta asset.

24. B is correct. In the CAPM, the market risk premium is the difference between
    the return on the market and the risk-free rate, which is the same as the return in
    excess of the market return.

25. B is correct. The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the
    capital asset pricing model, with beta risk on the x-axis and expected return on
    the y-axis.

26. B is correct. The security market line applies to any security, efficient or not. The
    CAL and the CML use the total risk of the asset (or portfolio of assets) rather
    than its systematic risk, which is the only risk that is priced.

27. B is correct. The expected return of Security 1, using the CAPM, is 12.0% = 3% +
    1.5(6%); E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf].

28. B is correct. The expected risk premium for Security 2 is 8.4%, (11.4% − 3%), indi-

                              rate is 3% the expected rate of return for the market is 9%. That is, using the
                              CAPM, E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf], 11.4% = 3% + 1.4(X%), where X% = (11.4% −
                              3%)/1.4 = 6.0% = market risk premium.

                          29. C is correct. Security 3 has the highest beta; thus, regardless of the value for the
                              risk-free rate, Security 3 will have the highest expected return:
                              E(Ri) = Rf + βi[E(Rm) – Rf]

                          30. C is correct. Security 3 has the highest beta; thus, regardless of the risk-free rate
                              the expected return of Security 3 will be most sensitive to a change in the expect-
                              ed market return.

                          31. A is correct. The homogeneity assumption refers to all investors having the
                              same economic expectation of future cash flows. If all investors have the same
                              expectations, then all investors should invest in the same optimal risky portfolio,
                              therefore implying the existence of only one optimal portfolio (i.e., the market
                              portfolio).

                          32. B is correct. The homogeneous expectations assumption means that all investors
                              analyze securities in the same way and are rational. That is, they use the same
                              probability distributions, use the same inputs for future cash flows, and arrive
                              at the same valuations. Because their valuation of all assets is identical, they will
                              generate the same optimal risky portfolio, which is the market portfolio.

                          33. C is correct. The Sharpe ratio ​​(​ˆ

                          34. C is correct. Jensen’s alpha adjusts for systematic risk, and M2 and the Sharpe
                              Ratio adjust for total risk.

                          35. C is correct. The sign of Jensen’s alpha indicates whether or not the portfolio has
                              outperformed the market. If alpha is positive, the portfolio has outperformed the
                              market; if alpha is negative, the portfolio has underperformed the market.

                          36. A is the correct. M2 adjusts for risk using standard deviation (i.e., total risk).

                          37. A is correct. The security characteristic line is a plot of the excess return of the
                              security on the excess return of the market. In such a graph, Jensen’s alpha is the
                              intercept and the beta is the slope.

                          38. B is correct. If the estimated return of an asset is above the SML (the expected re-
                              turn), the asset has a lower level of risk relative to the amount of expected return
                              and would be a good choice for investment (i.e., undervalued).

                          39. C is correct. This is because of the plot of the excess return of the security on the
                              excess return of the market. In such a graph, Jensen’s alpha is the intercept and
                              the beta is the slope.

40. C is correct. Since managers are concerned with maximizing risk-adjusted
    returns, securities with a higher value of Jensen’s alpha, αi, should have a higher
    weight.

41. C is correct. Since managers are concerned with maximizing risk-adjusted
    returns, securities with greater nonsystematic risk should be given less weight in

INTRODUCTION
This reading provides an overview of portfolio management and the asset management
                                                                                                   1
industry, including types of investors and investment plans and products. A portfolio
approach is important to investors in achieving their financial objectives. We outline
the steps in the portfolio management process in managing a client’s investment port-
folio. We next compare the financial needs of different types of investors: individual
and institutional investors. We then describe both defined contribution and defined
benefit pension plans. The asset management1 industry, which serves as a critical
link between providers and seekers of investment capital around the world, is broadly
discussed. Finally, we describe mutual funds and other types of pooled investment
products offered by asset managers.

                          RISK REDUCTION

                                           describe the portfolio approach to investing

                          One of the biggest challenges faced by individuals and institutions is to decide how to
                          invest for future needs. For individuals, the goal might be to fund retirement needs.
                          For such institutions as insurance companies, the goal is to fund future liabilities in
                          the form of insurance claims, whereas endowments seek to provide income to meet
                          the ongoing needs of such institutions as universities. Regardless of the ultimate
                          goal, all face the same set of challenges that extend beyond just the choice of what
                          asset classes to invest in. They ultimately center on formulating basic principles that
                          determine how to think about investing. One important question is: Should we invest
                          in individual securities, evaluating each in isolation, or should we take a portfolio
                          approach? By “portfolio approach,” we mean evaluating individual securities in rela-
                          tion to their contribution to the investment characteristics of the whole portfolio. In
                          the following section, we illustrate a number of reasons why a diversified portfolio
                          perspective is important.


                          Historical Example of Portfolio Diversification: Avoiding
                          Disaster
                          Portfolio diversification helps investors avoid disastrous investment outcomes. This
                          benefit is most convincingly illustrated by examining what may happen when indi-
                          viduals have not diversified.
                              We are usually not able to observe how individuals manage their personal invest-
                          ments. However, in the case of US 401(k) individual retirement portfolios,2 it is pos-
                          sible to see the results of individuals’ investment decisions. When we examine their
                          retirement portfolios, we find that some individual participants make sub-optimal
                          investment decisions.
                              During the 1990s, Enron Corporation was one of the most admired corporations
                          in the United States. A position in Enron shares returned over 27 percent per year
                          from 1990 to September 2000, compared to 13 percent for the S&P 500 Index for the
                          same time period.




                          2 In the United States, 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored individual retirement savings plans. They allow
                          individuals to save a portion of their current income and defer taxation until the time when the savings and
                          earnings are withdrawn. In some cases, the sponsoring firm will also make matching contributions in the
                          form of cash or shares. Individuals within certain limits have control of the invested funds and consequently
                          can express their preferences as to which assets to invest in.

During this time period, thousands of Enron employees participated in the company’s
401(k) retirement plan. The plan allowed employees to set aside some of their earnings
in a tax-deferred account. Enron participated by matching the employees’ contribu-
tions. Enron made the match by depositing required amounts in the form of Enron
shares. Enron restricted the sale of its contributed shares until an employee turned
50 years old. In January 2001, the employees’ 401(k) retirement accounts were valued
at over US$2 billion, of which US$1.3 billion (or 62 percent) was in Enron shares.
Although Enron restricted the sale of shares it contributed, less than US$150 million
of the total of US$1.3 billion in shares had this restriction. The implication was that
Enron employees continued to hold large amounts of Enron shares even though they
were free to sell them and invest the proceeds in other assets.
    A typical individual was Roger Bruce,3 a 67-year-old Enron retiree who held all
of his US$2 million in retirement funds in Enron shares. Between January 2001 and
January 2002, Enron’s share price fell from about US$90 per share to zero.

                                    Suppose you want to invest in one of these five securities next year. There is a wide
                                    variety of risk–return trade-offs for the five shares selected. If you believe that the
                                    future will replicate the past, then choosing Li & Fung would be a good choice. For
                                    the prior four years, Li & Fung provided the best trade-off between return and risk.
                                    In other words, it provided the most return per unit of risk. However, if there is no
                                    reason to believe that the future will replicate the past, it is more likely that the risk
                                    and return on the one security selected will be more like selecting one randomly.
                                    When we randomly selected one security each quarter, we found an average annualized
                                    return of 15.1 percent and an average annualized standard deviation of 24.9 percent,
                                    which would now become your expected return and standard deviation, respectively.
                                        Alternatively, you could invest in an equally weighted portfolio of the five shares,
                                    which means that you would invest the same dollar amount in each security for each
                                    quarter. The quarterly returns on the equally weighted portfolio are just the average
                                    of the returns of the individual shares. As reported in Exhibit 4, the equally weighted
                                    portfolio has an average return of 15.1 percent and a standard deviation of 17.9 percent.
                                    As expected, the equally weighted portfolio’s return is the same as the return on the
                                    randomly selected security. However, the same does not hold true for the portfolio
                                    standard deviation. That is, the standard deviation of an equally weighted portfolio is
                                    not simply the average of the standard deviations of the individual shares. In a more
                                    advanced reading we will demonstrate in greater mathematical detail how such a
                                    portfolio offers a lower standard deviation of return than the average of its individual
                                    components due to the correlations or interactions between the individual securities.
                                        Because the mean return is the same, a simple measure of the value of diversi-
                                    fication is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of the equally weighted
                                    portfolio to the standard deviation of the randomly selected security. This ratio may
                                    be referred to as the diversification ratio. In this case, the equally weighted portfolio’s
                                    standard deviation is approximately 72 percent of the average standard deviation of
                                    the 5 stocks (24.9%). The diversification ratio of the portfolio’s standard deviation to
                                    the individual asset’s standard deviation measures the risk reduction benefits of a
                                    simple portfolio construction method, equal weighting. Even though the companies
                                    were chosen from a similar industry grouping, we see significant risk reduction. An
                                    even greater portfolio effect (i.e., lower diversification ratio) could have been realized
                                    if we had chosen companies from completely different industries.
                                        This example illustrates one of the critical ideas about portfolios: Portfolios affect
                                    risk more than returns. In the prior section portfolios helped avoid the effects of
                                    downside risk associated with investing in a single company’s shares. In this section we
                                    extended the notion of risk reduction through portfolios to illustrate why individuals
                                    and institutions should hold portfolios.

THEORY

                   describe the portfolio approach to investing

In the previous section we compared an equally weighted portfolio to the selection of
a single security. In this section we examine additional combinations of the same set of
shares and observe the trade-offs between portfolio volatility of returns and expected
return (for short, their risk–return trade-offs). If we select the portfolios with the best
combination of risk and return (taking historical statistics as our expectations for the
future), we produce the set of portfolios shown in Exhibit 5.

In addition to illustrating that the diversified portfolio approach reduces risk, Exhibit
5 also shows that the composition of the portfolio matters. For example, an equally
weighted portfolio (20 percent of the portfolio in each security) of the five shares has an
expected return of 15.1 percent and a standard deviation of 17.9 percent. Alternatively,
a portfolio with 25 percent in Yue Yuen Industrial (Holdings), 3 percent in Cathay
Pacific, 52 percent in Hutchison Whampoa, 20 percent in Li & Fung, and 0 percent
in COSCO Pacific produces a portfolio with an expected return of 15.1 percent and a
standard deviation of 15.6 percent. Compared to a simple equally weighted portfolio,
this provides an improved trade-off between risk and return because a lower level of
risk was achieved for the same level of return.


Historical Portfolio Example: Not Necessarily Downside
Protection
A major reason that portfolios can effectively reduce risk is that combining securities
whose returns do not move together provides diversification. Sometimes a subset of
assets will go up in value at the same time that another will go down in value. The

                                 fact that these may offset each other creates the potential diversification benefit we
                                 attribute to portfolios. However, an important issue is that the co-movement or
                                 correlation pattern of the securities’ returns in the portfolio can change in a manner
                                 unfavorable to the investor. We use historical return data from a set of global indexes
                                 to show the impact of changing co-movement patterns.
                                      When we examine the returns of a set of global equity indexes over the last 15
                                 years, we observe a reduction in the diversification benefit due to a change in the
                                 pattern of co-movements of returns. Exhibit 6 and Exhibit 7 show the cumulative
                                 returns for a set of five global indexes7 for two different time periods. Comparing the
                                 first time period, from Q4 1993 through Q3 2000 (as shown in Exhibit 6), with the last
                                 time period, from Q1 2006 through Q1 2009 (as shown in Exhibit 7), we show that
                                 the degree to which these global equity indexes moved together increased over time.

During the period Q4 2007 through Q1 2009, the average return for the equally
weighted portfolio, including dividends, was −48.5 percent. Other than reducing the
risk of earning the return of the worst performing market, the diversification bene-
fits were small. Exhibit 9 shows the cumulative quarterly returns of each of the five
indexes over this time period. All of the indexes declined in unison. The lesson is that
although portfolio diversification generally does reduce risk, it does not necessarily
provide the same level of risk reduction during times of severe market turmoil as it
does when the economy and markets are operating ‘normally’. In fact, if the economy

                                     A is correct. Combining assets into a portfolio should reduce the portfolio’s vol-
                                     atility. However, the portfolio approach does not necessarily provide downside

                                  Portfolios: Modern Portfolio Theory
                                  The concept of diversification has been around for a long time and has a great deal
                                  of intuitive appeal. However, the actual theory underlying this basic concept and
                                  its application to investments only emerged in 1952 with the publication of Harry
                                  Markowitz’s classic article on portfolio selection.8 The article provided the foundation
                                  for what is now known as modern portfolio theory (MPT). The main conclusion of
                                  MPT is that investors should not only hold portfolios but should also focus on how
                                  individual securities in the portfolios are related to one another. In addition to the

diversification benefits of portfolios to investors, the work of William Sharpe (1964),
John Lintner (1965), and Jack Treynor (1961) demonstrated the role that portfolios
play in determining the appropriate individual asset risk premium (i.e., the return in
excess of the risk-free return expected by investors as compensation for the asset’s
risk). According to capital market theory, the priced risk of an individual security is
affected by holding it in a well-diversified portfolio. The early research provided the
insight that an asset’s risk should be measured in relation to the remaining systematic
or non-diversifiable risk, which should be the only risk that affects the asset’s price.
This view of risk is the basis of the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM, which is
discussed in greater detail in other readings. Although MPT has limitations, the
concepts and intuitions illustrated in the theory continue to be the foundation of
knowledge for portfolio managers.




STEPS IN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROCESS
                                                                                               4
              describe the steps in the portfolio management process

In the previous section we discussed a portfolio approach to investing. When estab-
lishing and managing a client’s investment portfolio, certain critical steps are followed
in the process. We describe these steps in this section.
    ■   The Planning Step

        ●   Understanding the client’s needs
        ●   Preparation of an investment policy statement (IPS)
    ■   The Execution Step

        ●   Asset allocation
        ●   Security analysis
        ●   Portfolio construction
    ■   The Feedback Step

        ●   Portfolio monitoring and rebalancing
        ●   Performance measurement and reporting



Step One: The Planning Step
The first step in the investment process is to understand the client’s needs (objectives
and constraints) and develop an investment policy statement (IPS). A portfolio
manager is unlikely to achieve appropriate results for a client without a prior under-
standing of the client’s needs. The IPS is a written planning document that describes
the client’s investment objectives and the constraints that apply to the client’s portfolio.
The IPS may state a benchmark—such as a particular rate of return or the perfor-
mance of a particular market index—that can be used in the feedback stage to assess
the performance of the investments and whether objectives have been met. The IPS
should be reviewed and updated regularly (for example, either every three years or
when a major change in a client’s objectives, constraints, or circumstances occurs).

                          The next step is for the portfolio manager to construct a suitable portfolio based on
                          the IPS of the client. The portfolio execution step consists of first deciding on a target
                          asset allocation, which determines the weighting of asset classes to be included in the
                          portfolio. This step is followed by the analysis, selection, and purchase of individual
                          investment securities.

                          Asset Allocation
                          The next step in the process is to assess the risk and return characteristics of the
                          available investments. The analyst forms economic and capital market expectations
                          that can be used to form a proposed allocation of asset classes suitable for the client.
                          Decisions that need to be made in the asset allocation of the portfolio include the
                          distribution between equities, fixed-income securities, and cash; sub-asset classes,
                          such as corporate and government bonds; and geographical weightings within asset
                          classes. Alternative assets—such as real estate, commodities, hedge funds, and private
                          equity—may also be included.
                              Economists and market strategists may set the top down view on economic con-
                          ditions and broad market trends. The returns on various asset classes are likely to be
                          affected by economic conditions; for example, equities may do well when economic
                          growth has been unexpectedly strong whereas bonds may do poorly if inflation
                          increases. The economists and strategists will attempt to forecast these conditions.




                             Top down—A top-down analysis begins with consideration of macroeconomic
                             conditions. Based on the current and forecasted economic environment, analysts
                             evaluate markets and industries with the purpose of investing in those that are
                             expected to perform well. Finally, specific companies within these industries
                             are considered for investment.

                                 Bottom up—Rather than emphasizing economic cycles or industry anal-
                             ysis, a bottom-up analysis focuses on company-specific circumstances, such
                             as management quality and business prospects. It is less concerned with broad
                             economic trends than is the case for top-down analysis, but instead focuses on
                             company specifics.


                          Security Analysis
                          The top-down view can be combined with the bottom-up insights of security analysts
                          who are responsible for identifying attractive investments in particular market sectors.
                          They will use their detailed knowledge of the companies and industries they cover to
                          assess the expected level and risk of the cash flows that each security will produce.
                          This knowledge allows the analysts to assign a valuation to the security and identify
                          preferred investments.

                          Portfolio Construction
                          The portfolio manager will then construct the portfolio, taking account of the target
                          asset allocation, security analysis, and the client’s requirements as set out in the IPS.
                          A key objective will be to achieve the benefits of diversification (i.e., to avoid putting
                          all the eggs in one basket). Decisions need to be taken on asset class weightings, sector
                          weightings within an asset class, and the selection and weighting of individual secu-
                          rities or assets. The relative importance of these decisions on portfolio performance
                          depends at least in part on the investment strategy selected; for example, consider

Steps in the Portfolio Management Process                                                                135


an investor that actively adjusts asset sector weights in relation to forecasts of sector
performance and one who does not. Although all decisions have an effect on port-
folio performance, the asset allocation decision is commonly viewed as having the
greatest impact.
    Exhibit 10 shows the broad portfolio weights of the endowment funds of Yale
University and the University of Virginia as of June 2017. As you can see, the portfolios
have a heavy emphasis on such alternative assets as hedge funds, private equity, and
real estate—Yale University particularly so.

Risk management is an important part of the portfolio construction process. The client’s
risk tolerance will be set out in the IPS, and the portfolio manager must make sure
the portfolio is consistent with it. As noted above, the manager will take a diversified
portfolio perspective: What is important is not the risk of any single investment, but
rather how all the investments perform as a portfolio.
    The endowments shown above are relatively risk tolerant investors. Contrast
the asset allocation of the endowment funds with the portfolio mix of the insurance
companies shown in Exhibit 11. You will notice that the majority of the insurance
assets are invested in fixed-income investments, typically of high quality. Note that
the Yale University portfolio has less than 5 percent invested in fixed income, with the
remainder invested in such growth assets as equity, real estate, and hedge funds. This
allocation is in sharp contrast to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company
(MassMutual) portfolio, which is 80 percent invested in bonds, mortgages, loans,
and cash—reflecting the differing risk tolerance and constraints (life insurers face
regulatory constraints on their investments).

                          The portfolio construction phase also involves trading. Once the portfolio manager
                          has decided which securities to buy and in what amounts, the securities must be
                          purchased. In many investment firms, the portfolio manager will pass the trades to a
                          buy-side trader—a colleague who specializes in securities trading—who will contact
                          a stockbroker or dealer to have the trades executed.


                          Step Three: The Feedback Step
                          Finally, the feedback step assists the portfolio manager in rebalancing the portfolio
                          due to a change in, for example, market conditions or the circumstances of the client.

                          Portfolio Monitoring and Rebalancing
                          Once the portfolio has been constructed, it needs to be monitored and reviewed and
                          the composition revised as the security analysis changes because of changes in security
                          prices and changes in fundamental factors. When security and asset weightings have
                          drifted from the intended levels as a result of market movements, some rebalancing
                          may be required. The portfolio may also need to be revised if it becomes apparent
                          that the client’s needs or circumstances have changed.

                          Performance Evaluation and Reporting
                          Finally, the performance of the portfolio must be evaluated, which will include assessing
                          whether the client’s objectives have been met. For example, the investor will wish to
                          know whether the return requirement has been achieved and how the portfolio has
                          performed relative to any benchmark that has been set. Analysis of performance may
                          suggest that the client’s objectives need to be reviewed and perhaps changes made to
                          the IPS. As we will discuss in the next section, there are numerous investment prod-
                          ucts that clients can use to meet their investment needs. Many of these products are
                          diversified portfolios that an investor can purchase.

                          types of mortgage- and asset-backed securities; Preferred and Common Shares—Investments in preferred

The portfolio management process described in the previous section may apply to
different types of investment clients. Such clients are broadly divided among indi-
vidual (or retail) and institutional investors. Each of these segments has distinctive
characteristics and needs, as discussed in the following sub-sections.


Individual Investors
Individual investors have a variety of motives for investing and constructing portfolios.
Short-term goals can include providing for children’s education, saving for a major
purchase (such as a vehicle or a house), or starting a business. The retirement goal—
investing to provide for an income in retirement—is a major part of the investment
planning of most individuals. Many employees of public and private companies invest
for retirement through defined contribution pension plans (DC plans). DC plans
are retirement plans in the employee’s name usually funded by both the employee
and the employer. Examples include 401(k) plans in the United States, group personal
pension schemes in the United Kingdom, and superannuation plans in Australia. With
DC plans, individuals will invest part of their wages while working, expecting to draw
on the accumulated funds to provide income during retirement or to transfer some
of their wealth to their heirs. The key to a DC plan is that the employee accepts the
investment and inflation risk and is responsible for ensuring that there are enough
assets in the plan to meet their needs upon retirement.
    Some individuals will be investing for growth and will therefore seek assets that
have the potential for capital gains. Others, such as retirees, may need to draw an
income from their assets and may therefore choose to invest more in fixed-income
and dividend-paying shares. The investment needs of individuals will depend in part
on their broader financial circumstances, such as their employment prospects and
whether or not they own their own residence. They may also need to consider such
issues as building up a cash reserve and the purchase of appropriate insurance policies
before undertaking longer-term investments.
    Asset managers serving individual investors typically distribute their products
directly to investors or through intermediaries such as financial advisers and/or
retirement plan providers. The distribution network for individual investors varies
globally. In the United States, financial advisers are independent or employed by
national or regional broker–dealers, banks, and trust companies. Additionally, many
asset managers distribute investment strategies to investors through major online
brokerage and custodial firms.
    In Europe, retail investment product distribution is fragmented and, in turn, var-
ies by country/region. In continental Europe, for example, distribution is primarily
driven through financial advisers affiliated with retail and private banks. In the United
Kingdom, products are sold through independent advisers as well as through advisers
representing a bank or insurance group. Retail distribution in Switzerland and in the
Nordic countries is driven mainly through large regional and private banks. In contrast
to the United States and Europe, in many Asian markets retail distribution is domi-
nated by large regional retail banks and global banks with private banking divisions.

                              Globally, many wealth management firms and asset managers target high-net-worth
                          investors. These clients often require more customized investment solutions alongside
                          tax and estate planning services.


                          Institutional Investors
                          Institutional investors primarily include defined benefit pension plans, endowments
                          and foundations, banks, insurance companies, investment companies, and sovereign
                          wealth funds. Each of these has unique goals, asset allocation preferences, and invest-
                          ment strategy needs.

                          Defined Benefit Pension Plans
                          Pension plans are typically categorized as either defined contribution (DC) or defined
                          benefit (DB). We previously described DC plans, which relate to individual investors.
                          Defined benefit pension plans (DB plans) are company-sponsored plans that offer
                          employees a predefined benefit on retirement. The future benefit is defined because
                          the DB plan requires the plan sponsor to specify the obligation stated in terms of the
                          retirement income benefits owed to participants. Generally, employers are responsible
                          for the contributions made to a DB plan and bear the risk associated with adequately
                          funding the benefits offered to employees. Plans are committed to paying pensions to
                          members, and the assets of these plans are there to fund those payments. Plan managers
                          need to ensure that sufficient assets will be available to pay pension benefits as they
                          come due. The plan may have an indefinitely long time horizon if new plan members
                          are being admitted or a finite time horizon if the plan has been closed to new members.
                          In some cases, the plan managers attempt to match the fund’s assets to its liabilities by,
                          for example, investing in bonds that will produce cash flows corresponding to expected
                          future pension payments. There may be many different investment philosophies for
                          pension plans, depending on funded status and other variables.
                              An ongoing trend is that plan sponsors increasingly favor DC plans over DB plans
                          because DC plans typically have lower costs/risk to the company. As a result, DB plans
                          have been losing market share of pension assets to DC plans. Nevertheless, DB plans,
                          both public and private, remain sizable sources of investment funds for asset managers.
                          As Exhibit 12 shows, global pension assets totaled more than US$41 trillion by the
                          end of 2017. The United States, United Kingdom, and Japan represent the three largest
                          pension markets in the world, comprising more than 76% of global pension assets.

Endowments and Foundations
Endowments are funds of non-profit institutions that help the institutions provide
designated services. In contrast, foundations are grant-making entities. Endowments
and foundations collectively represent an estimated US$1.6 trillion in assets in the
United States, which is the primary market for endowments and foundations.
    Endowments and foundations typically allocate a sizable portion of their assets in
alternative investments (Exhibit 14). This large allocation to alternative investments
primarily reflects the typically long time horizon of endowments and foundations, as
well as the popularity of endowment-specific asset allocation models developed by
Yale University’s endowment managers David Swensen and Dean Takahashi.

                          A typical investment objective of an endowment or a foundation is to maintain the
                          real (inflation-adjusted) capital value of the fund while generating income to fund the
                          objectives of the institution. Most foundations and endowments are established with
                          the intent of having perpetual lives. Exhibit 15 describes the Yale University endow-
                          ment’s approach to balancing short-term spending needs with ensuring that future
                          generations also benefit from the endowment, and it also shows the Wellcome Trust’s
                          approach. The investment approach undertaken considers the objectives and constraints
                          of the institution (for example, no tobacco investments for a medical endowment).

                           Exhibit 15: Spending Rules

                             The following examples of spending rules are excerpts from the Yale University
                             endowment (in the United States) and from the Wellcome Trust (in the United
                             Kingdom).

                             Yale University Endowment

                                  The spending rule is at the heart of fiscal discipline for an endowed insti-
                                  tution. Spending policies define an institution’s compromise between the
                                  conflicting goals of providing substantial support for current operations
                                  and preserving purchasing power of Endowment assets. The spending rule
                                  must be clearly defined and consistently applied for the concept of budget
                                  balance to have meaning.
                                      The Endowment spending policy, which allocates Endowment earnings
                                  to operations, balances the competing objectives of providing a stable flow
                                  of income to the operating budget and protecting the real value of the
                                  Endowment over time. The spending policy manages the trade-of between
                                  these two objectives by combining a long-term spending rate target with
                                  a smoothing rule, which adjusts spending in any given year gradually in
                                  response to changes in Endowment market value.
                                      The target spending rate approved by the Yale Corporation currently
                                  stands at 5.25%. According to the smoothing rule, Endowment spending
                                  in a given year sums to 80% of the previous year’s spending and 20% of
                                  the targeted long-term spending rate applied to the fiscal year-end market
                                  value two years prior.

Banks
Banks are financial intermediaries that accept deposits and lend money. Banks often
have excess reserves that are invested in relatively conservative and very short-duration
fixed-income investments, with a goal of earning an excess return above interest obli-
gations due to depositors. Liquidity is a paramount concern for banks that stand ready
to meet depositor requests for withdrawals. Many large banks have asset management
divisions that offer retail and institutional products to their clients.

Insurance Companies
Insurance companies receive premiums for the policies they write, and they need to
invest these premiums in a manner that will allow them to pay claims.
    Insurance companies can be segmented into two broad types: life insurers and
property and casualty (P&C) insurers. Insurance premiums from policyholders com-
prise an insurance company’s general account. To pay claims to policyholders, regu-
latory guidelines maintain that an insurance company’s general account is typically
invested conservatively in a diverse allocation of fixed-income securities. General
account portfolio allocations differ among life, P&C, and other specialty insurers
(e.g., reinsurance) because of both the varying duration of liabilities and the unique
liquidity considerations across insurance type.10 In contrast to the general account,
an insurer’s surplus account is the difference between its assets and liabilities. An
insurer’s surplus account typically targets a higher return than the general account
and thus often invests in less-conservative asset classes, such as public and private
equities, real estate, infrastructure, and hedge funds.
    Many insurance companies have in-house portfolio management teams responsible
for managing general account assets. Some insurance companies offer portfolio man-
agement services and products in addition to their insurance offerings. An increasing
trend among insurers (particularly in the United States) is outsourcing some of the
portfolio management responsibilities—primarily sophisticated alternative asset
classes—to unaffiliated asset managers. Several insurers manage investments for
third-party clients, often through separately branded subsidiaries.

Sovereign Wealth Funds
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are state-owned investment funds or entities that
invest in financial or real assets. SWFs do not typically manage specific liability
obligations, such as pensions, and have varying investment horizons and objectives
based on funding the government’s goals (for example, budget stabilization or future



10 For example, life insurers tend to invest in longer-term assets (e.g., 30-year government and corporate
bonds) relative to P&C insurers because of the longer-term nature of their liabilities.

The portfolio management process and investor types are broad components of the
asset management industry, which is an integral component of the global financial
services sector. At the end of 2017, the industry managed more than US$79 trillion
of assets owned by a broad range of institutional and individual investors (Exhibit
18).12 Although nearly 80% of the world’s professionally managed assets are in North
America and Europe, the fastest-growing markets are in Asia and Latin America.

The asset management industry is highly competitive. The universe of firms in the
industry is broad, ranging from “pure-play” independent asset managers to diversi-
fied commercial banks, insurance companies, and brokerages that offer asset man-
agement services in addition to their core business activities. Given the increasingly
global nature of the industry, many asset managers have investment research and
distribution offices around the world. An asset manager is commonly referred to as a

                          buy-side firm given that it uses (buys) the services of sell-side firms. A sell-side firm
                          is a broker/dealer that sells securities and provides independent investment research
                          and recommendations to their clients (i.e., buy-side firms).
                               Asset managers offer a broad range of strategies. Specialist asset managers may
                          focus on a specific asset class (e.g., emerging market equities) or style (e.g., quanti-
                          tative investing), while “full service” managers typically offer a wide variety of asset
                          classes and styles. Another type of asset manager firm is a “multi-boutique,” in which
                          a holding company owns several asset management firms that typically have spe-
                          cialized investment strategies. The multi-boutique structure allows individual asset
                          management firms to retain their own unique investment cultures—and often equity
                          ownership stakes—while also benefiting from the centralized, shared services of the
                          holding company (e.g., technology, sales and marketing, operations, and legal services).


                          Active versus Passive Management
                          Asset managers may offer either active or passive management. As of year-end 2017,
                          active management considerably exceeded passive management in terms of global
                          assets under management and industry revenue (Exhibit 19), although passive man-
                          agement has demonstrated significant growth.

                          Through fundamental research, quantitative research, or a combination of both, active
                          asset managers generally attempt to outperform either predetermined performance
                          benchmarks, such as the S&P 500, or, for multi-asset class portfolios, a combination
                          of benchmarks. In contrast to active managers, passive managers attempt to replicate
                          the returns of a market index. Despite the rise of passive management in asset share,
                          its share of industry revenue remains small given the low management fees relative to
                          active management. As Exhibit 19 illustrates, passive management represents a fifth
                          of global assets under management but only 6% of industry revenue.
                               Asset managers are increasingly offering other strategies beyond traditional
                          market-cap-weighted exposures. Some of these other strategies, commonly known as
                          smart beta, are based on such factors as size, value, momentum, or dividend char-
                          acteristics. Smart beta involves the use of simple, transparent, rules-based strategies
                          as a basis for investment decisions. Typically, smart beta strategies feature somewhat
                          higher management fees and higher portfolio turnover relative to passive market-cap
                          weighted strategies.

Traditional versus Alternative Asset Managers
Asset managers are typically categorized as either “traditional” or “alternative.”
Traditional managers generally focus on long-only equity, fixed-income, and multi-asset
investment strategies, generating most of their revenues from asset-based management
fees. Alternative asset managers, however, focus on hedge fund, private equity, and
venture capital strategies, among others, while generating revenue from both man-
agement and performance fees (or “carried interest”). As Exhibit 19 demonstrates,
alternative asset managers have a relatively low proportion of total global assets under
management but generate a disproportionately high total of industry revenue.
    Increasingly, the line between traditional and alternative managers has blurred.
Many traditional managers have introduced higher-margin alternative products to
clients. Concurrently, alternative managers seeking to reduce the revenue volatility
associated with performance fees have increasingly offered retail versions of their
institutional alternative strategies (typically referred to as “liquid alternatives”) as well
as long-only investment strategies. These liquid alternatives are often offered through
highly regulated pooled investment products (e.g., mutual funds) and typically feature
less leverage, no performance fees, and more liquid holdings than typical alternative
products.


Ownership Structure
The ownership structure of an asset manager can play an important role in retaining
and incentivizing key personnel. Portfolio managers who have personal capital invested
in their firms or investment strategies are often viewed favorably by potential investors
because of perceived alignment of management and client interests.
    The majority of asset management firms are privately owned, typically by individ-
uals who either established their firms or play key roles in their firms’ management.
Privately owned firms are typically structured as limited liability companies or limited
partnerships.
    While less common than privately owned managers, publicly traded asset managers
have substantial assets under management. A prevalent ownership form in the industry
is represented by asset management divisions of large, diversified financial services
companies that offer asset management alongside insurance and banking services.


Asset Management Industry Trends
The asset management industry is evolving and continues to be shaped by
socio-economic trends, shifting investor demands, advances in technology, and the
expansion of global capital markets. Three key trends that we discuss in this section
include the growth of passive investing, “big data” in the investment process, and the
emergence of robo-advisers in the wealth management industry.

Growth of Passive Investing
As we saw in Exhibit 19, passively managed assets comprised nearly a fifth of global
assets under management at the end of 2017. Management of passive assets is con-
centrated among a reasonably small group of asset managers and tends to be concen-
trated in equity strategies. As shown in Exhibit 20, the top three managers account for
70% of industry’s assets. One key catalyst supporting the growth of passive investing
is low cost for investors—management fees for index (or other passive) funds are
often a fraction of those for active strategies. Another catalyst is the challenge that
many active asset managers face in generating ex ante alpha, especially in somewhat
more-efficiently priced markets, such as large-cap US equities.

                          world’s entire universe of data was created in the previous two years. The digitization
                          of data and an exponential increase in computing power and data storage capacity
                          have expanded additional information sources for asset managers. Massive amounts
                          of data containing information of potential value to investors are created and captured
                          daily. These data include both structured data—such as order book data and security
                          returns—and data lacking recognizable structure, which is generated by a vast number
                          of activities on the internet and elsewhere (e.g., compiled search information). The
                          term “big data” is used to refer to these massively large datasets and their analysis.
                              Asset managers are using advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques to
                          help process and analyze these new sources of data. Such techniques are used in both
                          fundamentally driven and quantitatively driven investment processes. For example,
                          computers are used to “read” earnings and economic data releases much faster than
                          humans can and react with short-term trading strategies.
                              Third-party research vendors are supplying a vast range of relevant new data for
                          asset managers, such as data used for time-series and predictive models. Among the
                          most popular new sources of data are social media data and imagery and sensor data.
                              ■     Social media data. Real-time media and content outlets, such as Twitter
                                    and Facebook, provide meaningful market and company-specific announce-
                                    ments for investors and asset managers. In addition, the aggregation and
                                    analysis of social media users can aid key market sentiment indicators (e.g.,
                                    short-term directional market movements) and indicate potential specific
                                    user trends related to products and services.
                              ■     Imagery and sensor data. Satellite imagery and geolocation devices provide
                                    vast real-time data to investment professionals. As the cost of launching
                                    and maintaining satellites has decreased, more satellites have been launched
                                    to track sensors and imagery that are relevant to economic considerations
                                    (e.g., weather conditions, cargo ship traffic patterns) and company-specific
                                    considerations (e.g., retailer parking capacity/usage, tracking of retail
                                    customers).
                              The challenge for asset managers is to discover data with predictive potential and
                          to do so faster than fellow market participants. Many market participants are par-
                          ticipating in an “information arms race” that has required substantial investments in

Robo-Advisers: An Expanding Wealth Management Channel
Robo-advisers represent technology solutions that use automation and investment
algorithms to provide several wealth management services—notably, investment plan-
ning, asset allocation, tax loss harvesting, and investment strategy selection. Investment
and advice services provided by robo-advisers typically reflect an investor’s general
investment goals and risk tolerance preferences (often obtained from an investor
questionnaire). Robo-adviser platforms range from exclusively digital investment
advice platforms to hybrid offerings that offer both digital investment advice and the
services of a human financial adviser.
    At the end of 2017, robo-advisers managed an estimated US$180 billion in assets,13
and market participants expect that number to grow considerably over time. This
expected rapid growth in robo-advisory assets is based on several industry trends:
    ■    Growing demand from “mass affluent” and younger investors:
         Traditional investment advice has often underserved younger and “mass
         affluent” investors with lower relative levels of investable assets. Given the
         efficiencies of robo-advisers and the scalability of technology, customized
         but standardized investment advice now can be offered to a wide range and
         size of investors.
    ■    Lower fees: The cost of digital investment advice provided by robo-advisers
         is often a fraction of traditional investment advice channels because of
         scalability. For example, in the United States, a typical financial adviser
         may charge a 1% annual advisory fee14 based on a client’s assets, while
         robo-adviser fees typically average 0.20% annually.15 Additionally,
         robo-advisers often rely on lower fee underlying portfolio investment
         options, such as index funds or ETFs, when constructing portfolios for
         clients.
    ■    New entrants: Reflecting low barriers to entry, large wealth management
         firms have introduced robo-adviser solutions to service certain customer
         segments and appeal to a new generation of investors. In addition to these
         large wealth managers, other less-traditional entrants, such as insurance
         companies and asset managers, are developing solutions to cross-sell into
         their existing clients. Many market observers expect that non-financial firms
         (large technology leaders) will also become key players in the robo-adviser
         industry as they look to monetize their access to user data.

                          the individual creates her own portfolio by assembling individual securities, to large
                          institutions that employ individual portfolio managers to meet clients’ investment
                          management needs. Among the major investment products offered by asset managers
                          are mutual funds and other pooled investment products, such as separately managed
                          accounts, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and private equity/venture capital funds.


                          Mutual Funds
                          Rather than assemble a portfolio on their own, individual investors and institutions
                          can turn over the selection and management of their investment portfolio to a third
                          party. One way of doing this is through a mutual fund. This type of fund is a comin-
                          gled investment pool in which investors in the fund each have a pro-rata claim on the
                          income and value of the fund. The value of a mutual fund is referred to as the “net asset
                          value.” It is computed daily based on the closing price of the securities in the portfolio.
                              Mutual funds represent a primary investment product of individual investors
                          globally. According to the International Investment Funds Association, worldwide
                          regulated open-end fund assets totaled US$50 trillion as of the first quarter of 2018.
                          Exhibit 21 shows the growth of global open-end funds over the past five years by
                          region. Mutual funds provide several advantages, including low investment minimums,
                          diversified portfolios, daily liquidity, and standardized performance and tax reporting.

                          Mutual funds are one of the most important investment vehicles for individuals and
                          institutions. The best way to understand how a mutual fund works is to consider a
                          simple example. Suppose that an investment firm wishes to start a mutual fund with
                          a target amount of US$10 million. It is able to reach this goal through investments
                          from five individuals and two institutions. The investment of each is as follows:
                                                        Amount

Based on the US$10 million value (net asset value), the investment firm sets a total
of 100,000 shares at an initial value of US$100 per share (US$10 million/100,000 =
US$100). The investment firm will appoint a portfolio manager to be responsible for
the investment of the US$10 million. Going forward, the total value of the fund or
net asset value will depend on the value of the assets in the portfolio.
    The fund can be set up as an open-end fund or a closed-end fund. If it is an
open-end fund, it will accept new investment money and issue additional shares at a
value equal to the net asset value of the fund at the time of investment. For example,
assume that at a later date the net asset value of the fund increases to US$12 million
and the new net asset value per share is US$120. A new investor, F, wishes to invest
US$0.96 million in the fund. If the total value of the assets in the fund is now US$12
million or US$120 per share, in order to accommodate the new investment the fund
would create 8,000 (US$0.96 million/US$120) new shares. After this investment, the
net asset value of the fund would be US$12.96 million and there would be a total of
108,000 shares.
    Funds can also be withdrawn at the net asset value per share. Suppose on the same
day Investor E wishes to withdraw all her shares in the mutual fund. To accommo-
date this withdrawal, the fund will have to liquidate US$0.6 million in assets to retire
5,000 shares at a net asset value of US$120 per share (US$0.6 million/US$120). The
combination of the inflow and outflow on the same day would be as follows:
Type                                         Investment (US$)             Shares

Inflow (Investor F buys)                         $960,000                  8,000
Outflow (Investor E sells)                      –$600,000                 –5,000
Net                                              $360,000                  3,000

The net of the inflows and outflows on that day would be US$360,000 of new funds to
be invested and 3,000 new shares created. However, the number of shares held and the
value of the shares of all remaining investors, except Investor E, would remain the same.
    An alternative to setting the fund up as an open-end fund would be to create a
closed-end fund in which no new investment money is accepted into the fund. New
investors invest by buying existing shares, and investors in the fund liquidate by
selling their shares to other investors. Hence, the number of outstanding shares does
not change. One consequence of this fixed share base is that, unlike open-end funds
in which new shares are created and sold at the current net asset value per share,
closed-end funds can sell for a premium or discount to net asset value depending on
the demand for the shares.
    There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of fund. The open-end fund
structure makes it easy to grow in size but creates pressure on the portfolio manager
to manage the cash inflows and outflows. One consequence of this structure is the
need to liquidate assets that the portfolio manager might not want to sell at the time
to meet redemptions. Conversely, the inflows require finding new assets in which to
invest. As such, open-end funds tend not to be fully invested but rather keep some
cash for redemptions not covered by new investments. Closed-end funds do not
have these problems, but they do have a limited ability to grow. Of the total net asset
value of all US mutual funds at the end of 2017 (US$19 trillion), only approximately
1 percent were in the form of closed-end funds.

                              In addition to open-end or closed-end funds, mutual funds can be classified as
                          load or no-load funds. The primary difference between the two is whether the investor
                          pays a sales charge (a “load”) to purchase, hold, or redeem shares in the fund. In the
                          case of the no-load fund, there is no fee for investing in the fund or for redemption
                          but there is an annual fee based on a percentage of the fund’s net asset value. Load
                          funds are funds in which, in addition to the annual fee, a percentage fee is charged
                          to invest in the fund and/or for redemptions from the fund. In addition, load funds
                          are usually sold through retail brokers who receive part of the upfront fee. Overall,
                          the number and importance of load funds has declined over time.

                          asset type that they invest in: money market funds, bond mutual funds, stock mutual
                          funds, and hybrid or balanced funds.


                          Money Market Funds
                          Money market funds are mutual funds that invest in short-term money market instru-
                          ments such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. They aim
                          to provide security of principal, high levels of liquidity, and returns in line with money
                          market rates. Many funds operate on a constant net asset value (CNAV) basis where
                          the share price is maintained at $1 (or local currency equivalent). Others operate on
                          a variable net asset value (VNAV) basis where the unit price can vary. In the United
                          States, there are two basic types of money market funds: taxable and tax-free. Taxable
                          money market funds invest in high-quality, short-term corporate debt and federal
                          government debt. Tax-free money market funds invest in short-term state and local
                          government debt. Although money market funds have been a substitute for bank savings
                          accounts since the early 1980s, they are not insured in the same way as bank deposits.


                          Bond Mutual Funds
                          A bond mutual fund is an investment fund consisting of a portfolio of individual
                          bonds and, occasionally, preferred shares. The net asset value of the fund is the sum
                          of the value of each bond in the portfolio divided by the number of shares. Investors
                          in the mutual fund hold shares, which account for their pro-rata share or interest in
                          the portfolio. The major difference between a bond mutual fund and a money market
                          fund is the maturity of the underlying assets. In a money market fund the maturity is
                          as short as overnight and rarely longer than 90 days. A bond mutual fund, however,
                          holds bonds with maturities as short as one year and as long as 30 years (or more).
                          Exhibit 22 illustrates the general categories of bond mutual funds.16




                          16 In the United States, judicial rulings on federal powers of taxation have created a distinction between
                          (federally) taxable and (federally) tax-exempt bonds and a parallel distinction for US bond mutual funds.

Stock Mutual Funds
Historically, the largest types of mutual funds based on market value of assets under
management are stock (equity) funds.
    There are two types of stock mutual funds. The first is an actively managed fund
in which the portfolio manager seeks outstanding performance through the selection
of the appropriate stocks to be included in the portfolio. Passive management is fol-
lowed by index funds that are very different from actively managed funds. Their goal
is to match or track the performance of different indexes. The first index fund was
introduced in 1976 by the Vanguard Group.
    There are several major differences between actively managed funds and index
funds. First, management fees for actively managed funds are higher than for index
funds. The higher fees for actively managed funds reflect its goal to outperform an
index, whereas the index fund simply aims to match the return on the index. Higher
fees are required to pay for the research conducted to actively select securities. A sec-
ond difference is that the level of trading in an actively managed fund is much higher
than in an index fund, which depending on the jurisdiction, has tax implications.
Mutual funds are often required to distribute all income and capital gains realized in
the portfolio, so the actively managed fund tends to have more opportunity to real-
ize capital gains. This results in higher taxes relative to an index fund, which uses a
buy-and-hold strategy. Consequently, there is less buying and selling in an index fund
and less likelihood of realizing capital gains distributions.


Hybrid/Balanced Funds
Hybrid or balanced funds are mutual funds that invest in both bonds and stocks.
These types of funds represent a small fraction of the total investment in US mutual
funds but are more common in Europe. These types of funds, however, have gained
popularity with the growth of lifecycle funds. Lifecycle or Target Date funds manage
the asset mix based on a desired retirement date. For example, if an investor is 40 years
old in 2019 and planned to retire at the age of 67, he could invest in a mutual fund
with a target date of 2046 and the fund would manage the appropriate asset mix over
the next 27 years. In 2019 it might be 90 percent invested in shares and 10 percent in
bonds. As time passes, however, the fund would gradually change the mix of shares
and bonds to reflect the appropriate mix given the time to retirement.

              9           POOLED INTEREST - OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS

                                        describe mutual funds and compare them with other pooled
                                        investment products

                          A fund management service for institutions or individual investors with substantial
                          assets is the separately managed account (SMA), which is also commonly referred
                          to as a “managed account,” “wrap account,” or “individually managed account.”
                              SMAs are managed exclusively for the benefit of a single individual or institution.
                          Unlike a mutual fund, the assets of an SMA are owned directly by the individual or
                          institution. The main disadvantage of an SMA is that the required minimum invest-
                          ment is usually much higher than with a mutual fund.
                              Large institutional investors are generally the dominant users of SMAs. SMAs
                          enable asset managers to implement an investment strategy that matches an investor’s
                          specific objectives, portfolio constraints, and tax considerations, where applicable.
                          For example, a public pension plan investing in an asset manager’s large value equity
                          strategy might have a socially responsible investment preference. In this case, the plan
                          sponsor may wish to exclude certain industries, such as tobacco and defense, while
                          also including additional companies that are deemed favorable according to other
                          environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.


                          Exchange-Traded Funds
                          Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment funds that trade on exchanges (similar
                          to individual stocks) and are generally structured as open-end funds. ETFs represent
                          one of the fastest-growing investment products in the asset management industry.
                          According to BlackRock, global ETF assets increased from US$428 billion in 2005 to
                          US$4.9 trillion as of June 2018. Long-term investors—both institutional and retail—use
                          ETFs in building a diversified asset allocation. While ETFs are structured similarly to
                          open-end mutual funds, some key differences exist between the two products. One
                          difference relates to transaction price. Because they are traded on exchanges, ETFs
                          can be transacted (and are priced) intraday. That is, ETF investors buy the shares from
                          other investors just as if they were buying or selling shares of stock. ETF investors can
                          also short shares or purchase the shares on margin. In contrast, mutual funds typically
                          can be purchased or sold only once a day, and short sales or purchasing shares on
                          margin is not allowed. Mutual fund investors buy the fund shares directly from the
                          fund, and all investments are settled at the net asset value. In practice, the market price
                          of the ETF is likely to be close to the net asset value of the underlying investments.
                              Other key differences between ETFs and mutual funds relate to transaction costs
                          and treatment of dividends and the minimum investment amount. Dividends on
                          ETFs are paid out to the shareholders whereas mutual funds usually reinvest the
                          dividends. Finally, the minimum required investment in ETFs is usually smaller than
                          that of mutual funds.


                          Hedge Funds
                          Hedge funds are private investment vehicles that typically use leverage, derivatives,
                          and long and short investment strategies. The origin of hedge funds can be traced
                          back as far as 1949 to a fund managed by A.W. Jones & Co. It offered a strategy of

a non-correlated offset to the “long-only” position typical of most portfolios. Since
then, the hedge fund industry has grown considerably, with global hedge fund assets
totaling US$3.3 trillion as of May 2017.
    Hedge fund investment strategies are diverse and can range from specific niche
strategies (e.g., long–short financial services) to global multi-strategy approaches.
Consequently, hedge funds are often used by investors for portfolio diversification
purposes. In general, hedge funds share a few distinguishing characteristics:
    ■    Short selling: Many hedge funds implement short positions directly or
         synthetically using such derivatives as options, futures, and credit default
         swaps.
    ■    Absolute return seeking: Hedge funds often seek positive returns in all mar-
         ket environments.
    ■    Leverage: Many hedge funds use financial leverage (bank borrowing) or
         implicit leverage (using derivatives). The use and amount of leverage are
         dependent on the investment strategy being implemented.
    ■    Low correlation: Some hedge funds have historically exhibited low return
         correlations with traditional equity and/or fixed-income asset classes.
    ■    Fee structures: Hedge funds typically charge two distinct fees: a traditional
         asset-based management fee (AUM fee) and an incentive (or performance)
         fee in which the hedge fund earns a portion of the fund’s realized capital
         gains.17 Hedge funds have traditionally charged management fees of 2% and
         incentive fees of up to 20%, although there has been downward pressure
         on those fees amid increased competition and the availability of competing
         products.
    Hedge funds are not readily available to all investors. They typically require a high
minimum investment and often have restricted liquidity by allowing only periodic
(e.g., quarterly) withdrawals or having a long fixed-term commitment.


Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds
Private equity funds and venture capital funds are alternative funds that seek to buy,
optimize, and ultimately sell portfolio companies to generate profits. As of December
2017, assets under management in the private equity industry totaled US$3.1 trillion,
a historical high point.18 Most private equity and venture capital funds have a lifespan
of approximately 7–10 years (but usually subject to contractual extensions). Unlike
most traditional asset managers that trade in public securities, private equity and
venture firms often take a “hands-on” approach to their portfolio companies through
a combination of financial engineering (e.g., realizing expense synergies, changing
capital structures), installment of executive management and board members, and
significant contributions to the development of a target company’s business strategy.
The final investment stage, often referred to as the “exit” or “harvesting” stage, occurs
when a private equity or venture capital fund divests its portfolio companies through
a merger with another company, the acquisition by another company, or an initial
public offering (IPO).



17 Performance fees are often subject to high-water mark provisions, which preclude a manager from
earning a performance fee unless the value of a fund at the end of a predefined measurement period is
higher than the value of the fund at the beginning of the measurement period. The unpredictability of
future performance leads to uncertainty in performance fee revenue, which is regarded as less reliable than
revenue derived from management fees.

                              As with most alternative funds, the majority of private equity and venture capital
                          funds are structured as limited partnerships. These limited partnership agreements exist
                          between the fund manager, called the general partner (GP), and the fund’s investors,
                          called limited partners (LPs). The funds generate revenue through several types of fees:
                              ■   Management fees: Fees are based on committed capital (or sometimes net
                                  asset value or invested capital) and typically range from 1–3% annually.
                                  Sometimes these fees step down several years into the investment period of
                                  a fund.
                              ■   Transaction fees: Fees are paid by portfolio companies to the fund for
                                  various corporate and structuring services. Typically, a percentage of the
                                  transaction fee is shared with the LPs by offsetting the management fee.
                              ■   Carried interest: Carried interest is the GP’s share of profits (typically 20%)
                                  on sales of portfolio companies. Most GPs do not earn the incentive fee
                                  until LPs have recovered their initial investment.
                              ■   Investment income. Investment income includes profits generated on capital
                                  contributed to the fund by the GP.




                             SUMMARY
                              ■   A portfolio approach to investing could be preferable to simply investing in
                                  individual securities.
                              ■   The problem with focusing on individual securities is that this approach may
                                  lead to the investor “putting all her eggs in one basket.”
                              ■   Portfolios provide important diversification benefits, allowing risk to be
                                  reduced without necessarily affecting or compromising return.
                              ■   Understanding the needs of your client and preparing an investment policy
                                  statement represent the first steps of the portfolio management process.
                                  Those steps are followed by asset allocation, security analysis, portfolio con-
                                  struction, portfolio monitoring and rebalancing, and performance measure-
                                  ment and reporting.
                              ■   Types of investors include individual and institutional investors.
                                  Institutional investors include defined benefit pension plans, endowments
                                  and foundations, banks, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds.
                              ■   The asset management industry is an integral component of the global
                                  financial services sector. Asset managers offer either active management,
                                  passive management, or both. Asset managers are typically categorized as
                                  traditional or alternative, although the line between traditional and alterna-
                                  tive has blurred.
                              ■   Three key trends in the asset management industry include the growth of
                                  passive investing, “big data” in the investment process, and robo-advisers in
                                  the wealth management industry.
                              ■   Investors use different types of investment products in their portfolios.
                                  These include mutual funds, separately managed accounts, exchange-traded
                                  funds, hedge funds, and private equity and venture capital funds.

                          3. With respect to the formation of portfolios, which of the following statements is
                             most accurate?
                              A. Portfolios affect risk less than returns.

                              B. Portfolios affect risk more than returns.

   SOLUTIONS
1. A is correct. Combining assets into a portfolio should reduce the portfolio’s vol-
   atility. Specifically, “individuals and institutions should hold portfolios to reduce
   risk.” As illustrated in the reading, however, risk reduction may not be as great
   during a period of dramatic economic change.

2. A is correct. Combining assets into a portfolio should reduce the portfolio’s vola-
   tility. The portfolio approach does not necessarily provide downside protection or
   guarantee that the portfolio always will avoid losses.

3. B is correct. As illustrated in the reading, portfolios reduce risk more than they
   increase returns.

4. C is correct. The client’s objectives and constraints are established in the invest-
   ment policy statement and are used to determine the client’s target asset alloca-
   tion, which occurs in the execution step of the portfolio management process.

5. A is correct. Securities are analyzed in the execution step. In the planning step,
   a client’s objectives and constraints are used to develop the investment policy
   statement.

6. B is correct. Portfolio monitoring and rebalancing occurs in the feedback step of
   the portfolio management process.

7. C is correct. Portfolio 3 has the same equity exposure as Portfolio 1 and has a
   higher exposure to alternative assets, which have greater volatility (as discussed
   in the section of the reading comparing the endowments from Yale University
   and the University of Virginia).

8. A is correct. The excess reserves invested by banks need to be relatively liquid.
   Although investment companies and non-life insurance companies have high
   liquidity needs, the liquidity need for banks is on average the greatest.

9. B is correct. Most foundations and endowments are established with the intent of
   having perpetual lives. Although defined benefit plans and life insurance compa-
   nies have portfolios with a long time horizon, they are not perpetual.

10. A is correct. Income is necessary to meet the cash flow obligation to retirees.
    Although defined benefit plans have a need for income, the need for liquidity typ-
    ically is quite low. A retiree may need life insurance; however, a defined benefit
    plan does not need insurance.

11. B is correct. Investment companies manage investments in mutual funds. Al-
    though endowments and insurance companies may own mutual funds, they do
    not issue or redeem shares of mutual funds.

12. B is correct. Open-end funds trade at their net asset value per share, where-
    as closed-end funds and exchange traded funds can trade at a premium or a
    discount.

13. A is correct. Exchange traded funds do not have capital gain distributions. If an
    investor sells shares of an ETF (or open-end mutual fund or closed-end mutual
    fund), the investor may have a capital gain or loss on the shares sold; however, the
    gain (or loss) from the sale is not a distribution.

                          14. A is correct. Hedge funds are currently exempt from the reporting requirements
                              of a typical public investment company.

                          15. B is correct. Buyout funds or private equity firms make only a few large invest-

                              This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the investment policy
                          statement, a written document that captures the client’s investment objectives and
                          the constraints. Section 3 discusses the portfolio construction process, including the
                          first step of specifying a strategic asset allocation for the client. Section 4 concludes
                          and summarizes the reading.




              2           THE INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT

                                           describe the reasons for a written investment policy statement (IPS)
                                           describe the major components of an IPS


                          Portfolio planning can be defined as a program developed in advance of constructing
                          a portfolio that is expected to define the client’s investment objectives. The written
                          document governing this process is the investment policy statement (IPS). The IPS is
                          sometimes complemented by a document outlining policy on responsible investing—
                          the broadest (umbrella) term used to describe principles that typically address one
                          or more environmental, social, and governance themes that an investor requires to
                          be considered when evaluating whether to invest in a particular company, as well as
                          during the period of ownership. Sustainable investing, a term used in a similar con-
                          text to responsible investing, focuses on factoring in sustainability issues during the
                          investment process. Policies on responsible investing may also be integrated within
                          the IPS itself. In the remainder of this reading, the integration of responsible investing
                          within the IPS will be our working assumption.


                          The Investment Policy Statement
                          The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process. Without a full
                          understanding of the client’s situation and requirements, it is unlikely that successful
                          results will be achieved. “Success” can be defined as a client achieving his important
                          investment goals using means that he is comfortable with (in terms of risks taken and
                          other concerns). The IPS essentially communicates a plan for achieving investment
                          success.
                              The IPS is typically developed following a fact-finding discussion with the client.
                          This discussion can include the use of a questionnaire designed to articulate the client’s
                          risk tolerance as well as address expectations in connection with specific circum-
                          stances. In the case of institutional clients, the fact finding may involve asset–liability
                          management reviews, identification of liquidity needs, and a wide range of tax, legal,
                          and other considerations.
                              The IPS can take a variety of forms.1 A typical format will include the client’s
                          investment objectives and the constraints that apply to the client’s portfolio.
                              The client’s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return require-
                          ments. These elements must be consistent with each other: a client is unlikely to be
                          able to find a portfolio that offers a relatively high expected return without taking



                          1 In this reading, an IPS is assumed to be a document governing investment management activities covering
                          all or most of a client’s financial wealth. In many practical contexts, investment professionals work with
                          investment mandates that cover only parts of a client’s wealth or financial risk. Governance documents such
                          as “Limited Partnership Agreements” and “Investment Management Agreements” will govern such mandates.
                          Their contents are to a large degree comparable to the contents of the IPS as described in this reading.

The Investment Policy Statement                                                               163


on a relatively high level of expected risk. As part of their financial planning, clients
may specify specific spending goals, which need to be considered when setting risk
tolerance and return requirements.
     The constraints section covers factors that need to be taken into account when
constructing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives. The typical categories
are liquidity requirements, time horizon, regulatory requirements, tax status, and
unique needs. The constraints may be either internal (i.e., set by the client) or external
(i.e., set by law or regulation), as we discuss in detail later.
     Having a well-constructed IPS for all clients should be standard procedure for an
investment manager. The investment manager should build the portfolio with refer-
ence to the IPS and be able to refer to it to assess a particular investment’s suitability
for the client. In some cases, the need for the IPS goes beyond simply being a matter
of standard procedure. In certain countries, the IPS (or an equivalent document) is
a legal or regulatory requirement. For example, UK pension schemes must have a
statement of investment principles under the Pensions Act 1995 (Section 35), and
this statement is in essence an IPS. The UK Financial Services Authority also has
requirements for investment firms to “know their customers.” The European Union’s
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) requires firms to assign clients
to categories (eligible counterparties, institutional clients, or retail clients), with the
category type determining the types of protections and limitations relevant for the
client by law.
     In the case of an institution, such as a pension plan or university endowment, the
IPS may set out the governance arrangements that apply to the investment portfolio.
For example, this information could cover the investment committee’s approach to
appointing and reviewing investment managers for the portfolio, and the discretion
that those managers have.
     The IPS should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it remains consistent
with the client’s circumstances and requirements. For example, the UK Pensions
Regulator suggests that a pension scheme’s statements of investment principles—a
form of IPS—should be reviewed at least every three years. The IPS should also be
reviewed if the manager becomes aware of a material change in the client’s circum-
stances, as well as on the initiative of the client when her objectives, time horizon,
or liquidity needs change.


Major Components of an IPS
There is no single standard format for an IPS. Many IPS and investment governance
documents with a similar purpose (as noted previously), however, include the fol-
lowing sections:
    ■   Introduction. This section describes the client.
    ■   Statement of Purpose. This section states the purpose of the IPS.
    ■   Statement of Duties and Responsibilities. This section details the duties and
        responsibilities of the client, the custodian of the client’s assets, and the
        investment managers.
    ■   Procedures. This section explains the steps to take to keep the IPS current
        and the procedures to follow to respond to various contingencies.
    ■   Investment Objectives. This section explains the client’s objectives in
        investing.
    ■   Investment Constraints. This section presents the factors that constrain the
        client in seeking to achieve the investment objectives.

                              ■   Investment Guidelines. This section provides information about how policy
                                  should be executed (e.g., on the permissible use of leverage and derivatives)
                                  and on specific types of assets excluded from investment, if any.

                                  investors specify a strategic asset allocation (SAA), also known as the policy
                                  portfolio, which is the baseline allocation of portfolio assets to asset classes
                                  in view of the investor’s investment objectives and the investor’s policy with
                                  respect to rebalancing asset class weights. This SAA may include a state-
                                  ment of policy concerning hedging risks such as currency risk and interest
                                  rate risk.
                              The sections that are most closely linked to the client’s distinctive needs, and
                          probably the most important from a planning perspective, are those dealing with
                          investment objectives and constraints. An IPS focusing on these two elements has
                          been called an IPS in an “objectives and constraints” format.
                              In the following sections, we discuss the investment objectives and constraints
                          format of an IPS beginning with risk and return objectives. The process of developing
                          the IPS is the basic mechanism for evaluating and trying to improve an investor’s
                          overall expected return–risk stance. In a portfolio context, return objectives and
                          expectations must be tailored to be consistent with risk objectives. The risk and return
                          objectives must also be consistent with the constraints that apply to the portfolio. A
                          growing proportion of investors explicitly include non-financial considerations when
                          formulating their investment policies. This approach is often referred to as responsible
                          investing (discussed earlier alongside related terms), which reflects environmental,
                          social, and governance (ESG) considerations. Responsible investing recognizes that
                          ESG considerations may eventually affect the portfolio’s financial risk–return profile
                          and may express the investor’s societal convictions. In this reading, we discuss respon-
                          sible investing aspects of investment policy, where relevant.




              3           IPS RISK AND RETURN OBJECTIVES

                                         describe the major components of an IPS
                                         describe risk and return objectives and how they may be developed
                                         for a client
                                         explain the difference between the willingness and the ability
                                         (capacity) to take risk in analyzing an investor’s financial risk
                                         tolerance

                          When constructing a portfolio for a client, it is important to ensure that the risk of
                          the portfolio is suitable for the client. The IPS should state clearly the risk tolerance
                          of the client. Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the client’s
                          risk tolerance. Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute, relative, or a combination
                          of the two.
                              Examples of an absolute risk objective would be a desire not to suffer any loss of
                          capital or not to lose more than a given percentage of capital in any 12-month period.
                          Note that these objectives are unrelated to investment market performance, good
                          or bad, and are absolute in the sense of being self-standing. The fulfillment of such

IPS Risk and Return Objectives                                                                             165


objectives could be achieved by not taking any risk—for example, by investing in an
insured bank certificate of deposit at a creditworthy bank. If investments in risky assets
are undertaken, however, such statements could be restated as a probability statement
to be more operational (i.e., practically useful). For example, the desire not to lose
more than 4% of capital in any 12-month period might be restated as an objective that
with 95% probability the portfolio not lose more than 4% in any 12-month period.
Measures of absolute risk include the variance or standard deviation of returns and
value at risk.2
    Some clients may choose to express relative risk objectives, which relate risk relative
to one or more benchmarks perceived to represent appropriate risk standards. For
example, investments in large-cap UK equities could be benchmarked to an equity
market index, such as the FTSE 100 Index. The S&P 500 Index could be used as a
benchmark for large-cap US equities; for investments with cash-like characteristics,
the benchmark could be an interest rate such as Treasury bill rate. For risk relative to a
benchmark, the measure could be tracking risk, or tracking error.3 In practice, such
risk objectives are used in situations where the total wealth management activities on
behalf of a client are divided into partial mandates.
    Other clients take both the investor’s assets and liabilities into consideration
when establishing an IPS risk objective. In some cases where the size, timing and/
or relative certainty of future investor financial obligations are known, an IPS may
be tailored to meet these objectives in what is called a liability-driven investment
(LDI) approach. Examples of LDI include life insurance companies, defined benefit
pension plans or an individual’s budget after retirement. For example, a pension plan
must meet the pension payments as they come due, and the risk objective will be to
minimize the probability that it will fail to do so. A related return objective might be
to outperform the discount rate used in finding the present value of liabilities over a
multi-year time horizon.
    When a policy portfolio (that is, a specified set of long-term asset class weightings
and hedge ratios) is used, the risk objective may be expressed as a desire for the portfolio
return to be within a band of plus or minus X% of the benchmark return calculated
by assigning an index or benchmark to represent each asset class present in the policy
portfolio. Again, this objective may be more usefully interpreted as a statement of
probability—for example, a 95% probability that the portfolio return will be within
X% of the benchmark return over a stated period. Example 1 reviews this material.

EXAMPLE 1

   Types of Risk Objectives
   A Japanese institutional investor has a portfolio valued at ¥10 billion. The investor
   expresses her first risk objective as a desire not to lose more than ¥1 billion in
   the coming 12-month period. She specifies a second risk objective of achieving
   returns within 4% of the return to the TOPIX stock market index, which is her
   benchmark. Based on this information, address the following:

   1.

        a. Characterize the first risk objective as absolute or relative.




2 Value at risk is a money measure of the minimum value of losses expected during a specified period
at a given level of probability.
3 Tracking risk (sometimes called tracking error) is the standard deviation of the differences between a
portfolio’s returns and its benchmark’s returns.

                                   b. Give an example of how the risk objective could be restated in a prac-
                                      tical manner.
                                  Solution

                                  a. This is an absolute risk objective.
                                  b. This risk objective could be restated in a practical manner by speci-
                                     fying that the 12-month 95% value at risk of the portfolio must be no
                                     more than ¥1 billion.

                             2.

                                  a. Characterize the second risk objective as absolute or relative.
                                   b. Identify a measure for quantifying the risk objective.
                                  Solution

                                  a. This is a relative risk objective.
                                  b. This risk objective could be quantified using the tracking risk as a
                                     measure. For example, assuming returns follow a normal distribution,
                                     an expected tracking risk of 2% would imply a return within 4% of the
                                     index return approximately 95% of the time. Remember that tracking
                                     risk is stated as a one standard deviation measure.

                              A client’s overall risk tolerance is a function of the client’s ability to bear (accept)
                          risk and her “risk attitude,” which might be considered as the client’s willingness to
                          take risk. For ease of expression, from this point on we will refer to ability to bear risk
                          and willingness to take risk as the two components of risk tolerance. Above-average
                          ability to bear risk and above-average willingness to take risk imply above-average risk
                          tolerance. Below-average ability to bear risk and below-average willingness to take
                          risk imply below-average risk tolerance. These interactions are shown in Exhibit 1.



                             Exhibit 1: Risk Tolerance

                                                                             Ability to Bear Risk

                          Willingness to Take Risk             Below Average                   Above Average

                          Below Average                  Below-average risk tolerance        Resolution needed
                          Above Average                       Resolution needed         Above-average risk tolerance

                          The ability to bear risk is measured mainly in terms of objective factors, such as time
                          horizon, expected income, and level of wealth relative to liabilities. For example,
                          an investor with a 20-year time horizon can be considered to have a greater ability
                          to bear risk, other things being equal, than an investor with a 2-year horizon. This
                          difference is because over 20 years, there is more scope for losses to be recovered or
                          other adjustments made to circumstances than there is over 2 years.
                              Similarly, an investor whose assets are comfortably in excess of their liabilities has
                          more ability to bear risk than an investor whose wealth and expected future expen-
                          diture are more closely balanced. For example, a wealthy individual who can sustain
                          a comfortable lifestyle after a very substantial investment loss has a relatively high
                          ability to bear risk. A pension plan that has a large surplus of assets over liabilities
                          has a relatively high ability to bear risk.
                              The willingness to take risk, or risk attitude, is a more subjective factor based on
                          the client’s psychology and perhaps also his current circumstances. Although the list
                          of factors related to an individual’s risk attitude remains open to debate, it is believed

IPS Risk and Return Objectives                                                               167


that some psychological factors, such as personality type, self-esteem, and inclina-
tion to independent thinking, are correlated with risk attitude. Some individuals are
comfortable taking financial and investment risk, whereas others find it distressing.
Although there is no single agreed-upon method for measuring risk tolerance, a
willingness to take risk may be gauged by discussing risk with the client or by asking
the client to complete a psychometric questionnaire. For example, financial planning
academic John Grable and collaborators have developed 13-item and 5-item risk
attitude questionnaires that have undergone some level of technical validation. The
five-item questionnaire is shown in Exhibit 2.

                              Note that a question, such as the first one in Exhibit 2, indicates that risk attitude
                          may be associated with non-psychological factors (such as level of financial knowl-
                          edge and understanding and decision-making style) as well as psychological factors.
                              The adviser needs to examine whether a client’s ability to accept risk is consistent
                          with the client’s willingness to take risk. For example, a wealthy investor with a 20-year
                          time horizon, who is thus able to take risk, may also be comfortable taking risk; in
                          this case the factors are consistent. If the wealthy investor has a low willingness to
                          take risk, there would be a conflict.
                              The conflict between ability and willingness to take risk can also arise in the
                          institutional context. In addition, different stakeholders within the institution may
                          take different views. For example, the trustees of a well-funded pension plan may
                          desire a low-risk approach to safeguard the funding of the scheme and beneficiaries
                          of the scheme may take a similar view. The sponsor, however, may wish a higher-risk/
                          higher-return approach in an attempt to reduce future funding costs. When a trustee
                          bears a fiduciary responsibility to pension beneficiaries and the interests of the pen-
                          sion sponsor and the pension beneficiaries conflict, the trustee should act in the best
                          interests of the beneficiaries.
                              When both the ability and willingness to take risk are consistent, the investment
                          adviser’s task is the simplest. When ability to take risk is below average and willingness
                          to take risk is above average, the investor’s risk tolerance should be assessed as below
                          average overall. When ability to take risk is above average but willingness is below
                          average, the portfolio manager or adviser may seek to counsel the client and explain
                          the conflict and its implications. For example, the adviser could outline the reasons
                          why the client is considered to have a high ability to take risk and explain the likely
                          consequences, in terms of reduced expected return, of not taking risk. The investment
                          adviser, however, should not aim to change a client’s willingness to take risk that is not
                          a result of a miscalculation or misperception. Modification of elements of personality
                          is not within the purview of the investment adviser’s role. The prudent approach is to
                          reach a conclusion about risk tolerance consistent with the lower of the two factors
                          (ability and willingness) and to document the decisions made.
                              Example 2 is the first of a set that follows the analysis of an investment client
                          through the preparation of the major elements of an IPS.

                             1. Henri Gascon is an energy trader who works for a major French oil company
                                based in Paris. He is 30 years old and married with one son, aged 5. Gascon
                                has decided that it is time to review his financial situation and consults a
                                financial adviser, who notes the following aspects of Gascon’s situation:

                                 ■   Gascon’s annual salary of €250,000 is more than sufficient to cover the
                                     family’s outgoings.
                                 ■   Gascon owns his apartment outright and has €1,000,000 of savings.

  Solution:
     C is correct. Gascon has a high income relative to outgoings, a high level of
     assets, a secure job, and a time horizon of 20 years. This information sug-
     gests a high ability to take risk. At the same time, Gascon is knowledgeable

  The Case of Jacques Gascon: Risk Tolerance

  1. Marie Gascon is so pleased with the services provided by her financial
     adviser that she suggests to her brother Jacques that he should also consult
     the adviser. Jacques thinks it is a good idea. Jacques, a self-employed com-
     puter consultant also based in Paris, is 40 years old and divorced with four
     children, aged between 12 and 16. The financial adviser notes the following
     aspects of Jacques’ situation:

      ■   Jacques’ consultancy earnings average €40,000 per annum but are
          quite volatile.
      ■   Jacques is required to pay €10,000 per year to his ex-wife and children.
      ■   Jacques has a mortgage on his apartment of €100,000 and €10,000 of
          savings.
      ■   Jacques has a good knowledge of financial matters and expects that
          equity markets will deliver very high returns over the long term.
      ■   In the risk tolerance questionnaire, Jacques strongly disagrees with
          the statements “I am more comfortable putting my money in a bank
          account than in the stock market” and “When I think of the word ‘risk’,
          the term ‘loss’ comes to mind immediately.”
      ■   Jacques expects that most of his savings will be required to support his
          children at university.


     Based only on the information given, which statement is correct?
      A. Jacques has a low ability to take risk but a high willingness to take risk.
      B. Jacques has a high ability to take risk but a low willingness to take risk.
      C. Jacques has a high ability to take risk and a high willingness to take
         risk.

                             Solution:
                                A is correct. Jacques does not have a particularly high income, his income is
                                unstable, and he has reasonably high outgoings for his mortgage and main-
                                tenance payments. His investment time horizon is approximately two to six
                                years given the ages of his children and his desire to support them at univer-
                                sity. This finely balanced financial situation and short time horizon suggests
                                a low ability to take risk. In contrast, his expectations for financial market
                                returns and risk tolerance questionnaire answers suggest a high willingness
                                to take risk. The financial adviser may wish to explain to Jacques how finely
                                balanced his financial situation is and suggest that, despite his desire to take
                                more risk, a relatively cautious portfolio might be the most appropriate
                                approach to take.



                          Return Objectives
                          A client’s return objectives can be stated in a number of ways. Similar to risk objectives,
                          return objectives may be stated on an absolute or a relative basis.
                               As an example of an absolute objective, the client may want to achieve a particular
                          percentage rate of return. This objective could be a nominal rate of return or could
                          be expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
                               Alternatively, the return objective can be stated on a relative basis—for example,
                          relative to a benchmark return. The benchmark could be an equity market index, such
                          as the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100, or a cash rate of interest such as the market reference
                          rate (MRR). A relative return objective might be stated as, for example, a desire to
                          outperform the benchmark index by one percentage point per year.
                               Some institutions also set their return objectives relative to a peer group or uni-
                          verse of managers—for example, an endowment aiming for a return that is in the
                          top 50% of returns of similar institutions, or a private equity mandate aiming for
                          returns in the top quartile among the private equity universe. This objective can be
                          problematic when limited information is known about the investment strategies or
                          the return calculation methodology being used by peers, and we must bear in mind
                          the impossibility of all institutions being “above average.” Furthermore, a good bench-
                          mark should be investable—that is, able to be replicated by the investor—and a peer
                          benchmark typically does not meet that criterion.
                               In each case, the return requirement can be stated before or after fees. Care should
                          be taken that the fee basis used is clear and understood by both the manager and client.
                          The return can also be stated on either a pre- or post-tax basis when the investor is
                          required to pay tax. For a taxable investor, the baseline is to state and analyze returns
                          on an after-tax basis.
                               The return objective could be a required return—that is, the amount the investor
                          needs to earn to meet a particular future goal—such as a certain level of retirement
                          income.
                               The manager or adviser must ensure that the return objective is realistic. Care
                          should be taken that client and manager are in agreement on whether the return
                          objective is nominal (which is more convenient for measurement purposes) or real
                          (i.e., inflation-adjusted, which usually relates better to the objective). It must be
                          consistent with the client’s risk objective (high expected returns are unlikely to be
                          possible without high levels of risk) and also with the current economic and market
                          environment. For example, 15% nominal returns might be possible when inflation is
                          10% but will be unlikely when inflation is 3%.

   When a client has unrealistic return expectations, the manager or adviser will
need to counsel her about what is achievable in the current market environment and
within the client’s tolerance for risk.

EXAMPLE 4

  The Case of Marie Gascon: Return Objectives
  Having assessed her risk tolerance, Marie Gascon now begins to discuss her
  retirement income needs with the financial adviser. She wishes to retire at age
  50, which is 20 years from now. Her salary meets current and expected future
  expenditure requirements, but she does not expect to be able to make any
  additional pension contributions to her fund. Gascon sets aside €100,000 of
  her savings as an emergency fund to be held in cash. The remaining €900,000
  is invested for her retirement.
       Gascon estimates that a before-tax amount of €2,000,000 in today’s money
  will be sufficient to fund her retirement income needs. The financial adviser
  expects inflation to average 2% per year over the next 20 years. Pension fund
  contributions and pension fund returns in France are exempt from tax, but
  pension fund distributions are taxable upon retirement.

  1. Which of the following is closest to the amount of money Gascon will have
     to accumulate in nominal terms by her retirement date to meet her retire-
     ment income objective (i.e., expressed in money of the day in 20 years)?
      A. €900,000
      B. €2,000,000
      C. €3,000,000
  Solution:
     C is correct. At 2% annual inflation, €2,000,000 in today’s money equates
     to €2,971,895 in 20 years measured in money of the day [€2,000,000 × (1 +
     2%)20].

  2. Which of the following is closest to the annual rate of return that Gas-
     con must earn on her pension portfolio to meet her retirement income
     objective?
      A. 2.0%
      B. 6.2%
      C. 8.1%
  Solution:
     B is correct. €900,000 growing at 6.2% per year for 20 years will accumulate
     to €2,997,318, which is just above the required amount. (The solution of
     6.2% comes from €2,997,318/€900,000 = (1 + X)20, where X is the required
     rate of return.)

              4           IPS CONSTRAINTS

                                         describe the major components of an IPS
                                         describe the investment constraints of liquidity, time horizon, tax
                                         concerns, legal and regulatory factors, and unique circumstances and
                                         their implications for the choice of portfolio assets

                          In the following sections, we analyze five major types of constraints on portfolio
                          selection: liquidity, time horizon, tax concerns, legal and regulatory factors, and
                          unique circumstances.


                          Liquidity Requirements
                          The IPS should state what the likely requirements are to withdraw funds from the
                          portfolio. Examples for an individual investor would be outlays for covering healthcare
                          payments or tuition fees. For institutions, it could be spending rules and requirements
                          for endowment funds, the existence of claims coming due in the case of property and
                          casualty insurance, or benefit payments for pension funds and life insurance companies.
                              When the client does have such a requirement, the manager should allocate
                          part of the portfolio to cover the liability. This part of the portfolio will be invested
                          in assets that are liquid—that is, easily converted to cash—and have low risk when
                          the liquidity need is actually present (e.g., a bond maturing at the time when private
                          education expenses will be incurred), so that their value is known with reasonable
                          certainty. For example, the asset allocation in the insurance portfolios of US insurer
                          Progressive Corporation (see Exhibit 3) shows a large allocation to fixed-income
                          investments (called “Fixed maturities” by the company), some of which are either
                          highly liquid or have a short maturity. These investments enable the company, in the
                          case of automobile insurance, to pay claims for which the timing is unpredictable.

IPS Constraints                                                                             173



Time Horizon
The IPS should state the time horizon over which the investor is investing. It may
be the period over which the portfolio is accumulating before any assets need to be
withdrawn; it could also be the period until the client’s circumstances are likely to
change. For example, a 55-year-old pension plan investor hoping to retire at age 65 has
a 10-year horizon. The portfolio may not be liquidated at age 65, but its structure may
need to change, for example, as the investor begins to draw an income from the fund.
    The time horizon of the investor will affect the nature of investments used in
the portfolio. Illiquid or risky investments may be unsuitable for an investor with a
short time horizon because the investor may not have enough time to recover from
investment losses, for example. Such investments, however, may be suitable for an
investor with a longer horizon, especially if the risky investments are expected to
have higher returns.

EXAMPLE 5

   Investment Time Horizon

   1. Frank Johnson is investing for retirement and has a 20-year horizon. He has
      an average risk tolerance. Which investment is likely to be the least suitable
      for a major allocation in Johnson’s portfolio?
      A. Listed equities
      B. Private equity
      C. US Treasury bills
   Solution:
      C is correct. With a 20-year horizon and average risk tolerance, Johnson can
      accept the additional risk of listed equities and private equity compared with
      US Treasury bills.

   2. Al Smith has to pay a large tax bill in six months and wants to invest the
      money in the meantime. Which investment is likely to be the least suitable
      for a major allocation in Smith’s portfolio?
      A. Listed equities
      B. Private equity
      C. US Treasury bills
   Solution:
      B is correct. Private equity is risky, has no public market, and is the least
      liquid among the assets mentioned.



Tax Concerns
Tax status varies among investors. Some investors will be subject to taxation on
investment returns and some will not. For example, in many countries, returns to
pension funds are exempt from tax. Some investors will face a different tax rate on
income (dividends and interest payments) than they do on capital gains (associated
with increases in asset prices). Typically, when there is a differential, income is taxed
more highly than gains. Gains may be subject to a lower tax rate, or part or all of the
                          © CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.
174   Learning Module 4                                            Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction


                          gain may be exempt from taxation. Furthermore, income may be taxed as it is earned,
                          whereas gains may be taxed when they are realized. Hence, in such cases there is a
                          time value of money benefit in the deferment of taxation of gains relative to income.
                              In many cases, the portfolio should reflect the tax status of the client. For exam-
                          ple, a taxable investor may wish to hold a portfolio that emphasizes capital gains and
                          receives little income. A taxable investor based in the United States is also likely to
                          consider including US municipal bonds (“munis”) in his portfolio because interest
                          income from munis, unlike from Treasuries and corporate bonds, is exempt from
                          taxes. A tax-exempt investor, such as a pension fund, will be relatively indifferent to
                          the form of returns.


                          Legal and Regulatory Factors
                          The IPS should state any legal and regulatory restrictions that constrain how the
                          portfolio is invested.
                              In some countries, such institutional investors as pension funds are subject to
                          restrictions on portfolio composition. For example, there may be a limit on the pro-
                          portion of equities or other risky assets in the portfolio or on the proportion of the
                          portfolio that may be invested overseas. The United States has no limits on pension
                          fund asset allocation, but some countries do, examples of which are shown in Exhibit
                          4. Pension funds also often face restrictions on the percentage of assets that can be
                          invested in securities issued by the plan sponsor, so called self-investment limits.

                          When an individual has access to material nonpublic information about a particular
                          security, this situation may also form a constraint. For example, the directors of a public
                          company may need to refrain from trading the company’s stock at certain points of
                          the year before financial results are published. The IPS should note this constraint so
                          that the portfolio manager does not inadvertently trade the stock on the client’s behalf.


                          Unique Circumstances and ESG Considerations
                          This section of the IPS should cover any other aspect of the client’s circumstances,
                          including beliefs and values, that is likely to have a material impact on portfolio com-
                          position. A client may have considerations derived from her faith or moral values that
                          could constrain investment choices. For instance, an investor seeking compliance with
                          Shari’a (the Islamic law) will avoid investing in businesses and financial instruments
                          inconsistent with Shari’a, such as casinos and bonds, because Shari’a prohibits gambling

and lending money on interest. Similarly, an investor may wish to avoid investments
that he believes are inconsistent with his faith. Charitable and pension fund investors
may have constituencies that want to express their values in an investment portfolio.
    Whether rooted in religious beliefs or not, a client may have personal objections to
certain products (e.g., weapons, tobacco, gambling) or practices (e.g., environmental
impact of business activities, human impact of government policies, labor standards),
which could lead to the exclusion of certain companies, countries, or types of secu-
rities (e.g., interest-bearing debt) from the investable universe as well as the client’s
benchmark. Investing in accordance with such considerations is referred to as socially
responsible investing (SRI).
    Specific ESG investment approaches can be classified in a variety of ways, and the
investment community lacks clear consensus on terminology. We define six generic
ESG investment approaches:
    ■   Negative screening: Excluding companies or sectors based on business activi-
        ties or environmental or social concerns;
    ■   Positive screening: Including sectors or companies based on specific ESG
        criteria, typically ESG performance relative to industry peers;
    ■   ESG integration: Systematic consideration of material ESG factors in asset
        allocation, security selection, and portfolio construction decisions;
    ■   Thematic investing: Investing in themes or assets related to ESG factors;
    ■   Engagement/active ownership: Using shareholder power to influence cor-
        porate behavior to achieve targeted ESG objectives along with financial
        returns; and
    ■   Impact investing: Investments made with the intention to generate positive,
        measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial return.
   These ESG investment approaches may impact a portfolio manager’s investment
universe and may also require the investment management firm to put in place a
process to systematically incorporate ESG factors into the investment process.

                             www​.bmogam​.com/​gb​-en/​intermediary/​bmo​-responsible​-uk​-equity​-2​-inc/​.]

                              When the portfolio represents only part of the client’s total wealth, there may be
                          aspects or portions of wealth not under the control of the manager that have impli-
                          cations for the portfolio. For example, an employee of a public company whose labor
                          income and retirement income provision are reliant on that company, and who may
                          have substantial investment exposure to the company through employee share options
                          and stock holdings, may decide that his portfolio should not invest additional amounts
                          in that stock. An entrepreneur may be reluctant to see her portfolio invested in the
                          shares of competing businesses or in any business that has risk exposures aligned with
                          her entrepreneurial venture.
                              A client’s income may rely on a particular industry or asset class. Appropriate
                          diversification requires that industry or asset class to be de-emphasized in the cli-
                          ent’s investments. For example, a stockbroker should consider having a relatively low
                          weighting in equities, as his skills and thus his income-generating ability are worth
                          less when equities do not perform well. Employees should similarly be wary of having
                          concentrated share positions in the equity of the company where they work. If the
                          employer encounters difficulties, not only may its employees lose their jobs but their
                          investment portfolios could also suffer a significant loss of value.




              5           GATHERING CLIENT INFORMATION

                                        describe risk and return objectives and how they may be developed
                                        for a client
                                        describe the investment constraints of liquidity, time horizon, tax
                                        concerns, legal and regulatory factors, and unique circumstances and
                                        their implications for the choice of portfolio assets

                          As noted earlier, it is important for portfolio managers and investment advisers to
                          know their clients. For example, in the EU, MiFID II requires financial intermediaries
                          to undertake substantial fact finding. This is required not only in the case of full-service
                          wealth management or in the context of an IPS but also in “lighter” forms of financial
                          intermediation, such as advisory relationships (in which clients make investment
                          decisions after consultation with their investment adviser or broker) or execution-only
                          relationships (in which the client makes investment decisions independently).

Gathering Client Information                                                              177


    An exercise in fact finding about the customer should take place at the beginning
of the client relationship. This process will involve gathering information about the
client’s circumstances as well as discussing the client’s objectives and requirements.
    Important data to gather from a client should cover family and employment
situation as well as financial information. If the client is an individual, it may also
be necessary to know about the situation and requirements of the client’s spouse or
other family members. The health of the client and her dependents is also relevant
information. In an institutional relationship, it will be important to know about key
stakeholders in the organization and what their perspective and requirements are.
Information gathering may be done in an informal way or may involve structured
interviews, questionnaires, or analysis of data. Many advisers will capture data elec-
tronically and use special systems that record data and produce customized reports.
    Good recordkeeping is very important and may be crucial in a case in which any
aspect of the client relationship comes into dispute at a later stage.

EXAMPLE 7

  Marie Gascon: Description of Constraints
  Marie Gascon continues to discuss her investment requirements with her
  financial adviser. The adviser begins to draft the constraints section of the IPS.
      Gascon expects that she will continue to work for the oil company and that
  her relatively high income will continue for the foreseeable future. Gascon and
  her husband plan to have no additional children but expect that their son will
  go to a university at age 18. They expect that their son’s education costs can be
  met out of their salary income.
      Gascon’s emergency reserve of €100,000 is considered to be sufficient as a
  reserve for unforeseen expenditures and emergencies. Her retirement savings of
  €900,000 has been contributed to her defined-contribution pension plan account
  to fund her retirement. Under French regulation, pension fund contributions
  are paid from gross income (i.e., income prior to deduction of tax), and pension
  fund returns are exempt from tax, but pension payments from a fund to retirees
  are taxed as income to the retiree.
      With respect to Gascon’s retirement savings portfolio, refer back to Example
  2 as needed and address the following:

  1. As concerns liquidity,
      A. a maximum of 50% of the portfolio should be invested in liquid assets.
      B. the portfolio should be invested entirely in liquid assets because of
         high spending needs.
      C. the portfolio has no need for liquidity because there are no short-term
         spending requirements.
  Solution:
     C is correct. The assets are for retirement use, which is 20 years away. Any
     short-term spending needs will be met from other assets or income.

  2. The investment time horizon is closest to
      A. 5 years.
      B. 20 years.
      C. 40 years.

                             Solution:
                                B is correct. The relevant time horizon is to the retirement date, which is
                                20 years away. The assets may not be liquidated at that point, but a restruc-
                                turing of the portfolio is to be expected as Gascon starts to draw an income
                                from it.

                             3. As concerns taxation, the portfolio
                                 A. should emphasize capital gains because income is taxable.
                                 B. should emphasize income because capital gains are taxable.
                                 C. is tax exempt and thus indifferent between income and capital gains.
                             Solution:
                                C is correct. Because no tax is paid in the pension fund, it does not matter
                                whether returns come in the form of income or capital gains.

                             4. The principle legal and regulatory factors applying to the portfolio are
                                 A. US securities laws.
                                 B. European banking laws.
                                 C. French pension fund regulations.
                             Solution:
                                C is correct. Management of the portfolio will have to comply with any rules
                                relating to French pension funds.

                             5. As concerns unique needs, the portfolio should
                                 A. have a high weighting in oil and other commodity stocks.
                                 B. be invested only in responsible and sustainable investments.
                                 C. not have significant exposure to oil and other commodity stocks.
                             Solution:
                                C is correct. Gascon’s human capital (i.e., future labor income) is affected by
                                the prospects of the oil industry. If her portfolio has significant exposure to
                                oil stocks, she would be increasing a risk exposure she already has.

                             Example 8, the final one based on Marie Gascon, shows how the information
                          obtained from the fact-finding exercises might be incorporated into the objectives
                          and constraints section of an IPS.

                           EXAMPLE 8

                             Marie Gascon: Outline of an IPS
                             Following is a simplified excerpt from the IPS the adviser prepares for Marie
                             Gascon, covering objectives and constraints.
                             Risk Objectives:

                                 ■   The portfolio may take on relatively high amounts of risk in seeking
                                     to meet the return requirements. With a 20-year time horizon and
                                     significant assets and income, the client has an above-average ability to

           take risk. The client is a knowledgeable investor, with an above-aver-
           age willingness to take risk. Hence, the client’s risk tolerance is above
           average, explaining the aforementioned portfolio risk objective.
       ■   The portfolio should be well diversified with respect to asset classes
           and concentration of positions within an asset class. Although the
           client has above-average risk tolerance, his investment assets should
           be diversified to control the risk of catastrophic loss.

   Return Objectives:

       ■   The portfolio’s long-term return requirement is 6.2% per year, in nomi-
           nal terms and net of fees, to meet the client’s retirement income goal.
   Constraints:

       ■   Liquidity: The portfolio consists of pension fund assets, and there is no
           need for liquidity in the short to medium term.
       ■   Time Horizon: The portfolio will be invested with a 20-year time hori-
           zon. The client intends to retire in 20 years, at which time an income
           will be drawn from the portfolio.
       ■   Tax Status: Under French law, contributions to the fund are made
           gross of tax and returns in the fund are tax-free. Hence, the client is
           indifferent between income and capital gains in the fund.
       ■   Legal and Regulatory Factors: Management of the portfolio must com-
           ply with French pension fund regulations.
       ■   Unique Needs: The client is an executive in the oil industry. The port-
           folio should strive to minimize additional exposures to oil and related
           stocks.




PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION AND CAPITAL MARKET
EXPECTATIONS                                                                                   6

              describe the principles of portfolio construction and the role of asset
              allocation in relation to the IPS

Once the IPS has been compiled, the investment manager can construct a suitable
portfolio. Strategic asset allocation is a traditional focus of the first steps in portfolio
construction. The strategic asset allocation is stated in terms of percentage allocations
to asset classes. An asset class is a category of assets that have similar characteristics,
attributes, and risk–return relationships. The strategic asset allocation (SAA) is the
set of exposures to IPS-permissible asset classes that is expected to achieve the client’s
long-term objectives given the client’s risk profile and investment constraints. An
SAA could include a policy of hedging portfolio risks not explicitly covered by asset
class weights. The obvious examples are hedge ratios for foreign currency exposure,
or the management of interest rate risk resulting from asset-liability mismatch, and
the hedging of inflation risk. So-called “overlay” portfolios of derivatives are often
used for this purpose.

                              The focus on the SAA is the result of a number of important investment princi-
                          ples. One principle is that a portfolio’s systematic risk accounts for most of its change
                          in value over the long term. Systematic risk is risk related to the economic system
                          (e.g., risk related to business cycle) that cannot be eliminated by holding a diversified
                          portfolio. This risk is different from nonsystematic risk, defined as the unique risks of
                          particular assets, which may be avoided by holding other assets with offsetting risks.
                          A second principle is that the returns to groups of similar assets (e.g., long-term debt
                          claims) predictably reflect exposures to certain sets of systematic factors (e.g., for the
                          debt claims, unexpected changes in the interest rate). Thus, the SAA is a means of
                          providing the investor with exposure to the systematic risks of asset classes in pro-
                          portions that meet the risk and return objectives.
                              The process of formulating a strategic asset allocation is based on the IPS, already
                          discussed, and capital market expectations.


                          Capital Market Expectations
                          Capital market expectations are the investor’s expectations concerning the risk and
                          return prospects of asset classes, however broadly or narrowly the investor defines those
                          asset classes. When associated with the client’s investment objectives, the result is the
                          strategic asset allocation that is expected to allow the client to achieve his investment
                          objectives (at least under normal capital market conditions).
                              Traditionally, capital market expectations are quantified in terms of asset class
                          expected returns, standard deviation of returns, and correlations among pairs of asset
                          classes. Formally, the expected return of an asset class consists of the risk-free rate
                          and one or more risk premium(s) associated with the asset class. Expected returns are
                          in practice developed in a variety of ways, including the use of historical estimates,
                          economic analysis, and various kinds of valuation models. Standard deviations and
                          correlation estimates are frequently based on historical data and risk models.

                                        allocation in relation to the IPS

                          Traditionally, investors have distinguished cash, equities, bonds (government and
                          corporate), and real estate as the major asset classes. In recent years, this list has been
                          expanded with private equity, hedge funds, high-yield and emerging market bonds,
                          and commodities. In addition, such assets as art and intellectual property rights may
                          be considered asset classes for those investors prepared to take a more innovative
                          approach and to accept some illiquidity. Combining such new asset classes as well
                          as hedge funds and private equity under the header “alternative investments” has
                          become accepted practice.
                              As the strategic asset allocation is built up by asset classes, the decision about
                          how to define those asset classes is an important one. Defining the asset classes also
                          determines the extent to which the investor controls the risk and return character-
                          istics of the eventual investment portfolio. For example, separating bonds into gov-
                          ernment bonds and corporate bonds, and then further separating corporate bonds
                          into investment grade and non-investment grade (high yield) and government bonds

Strategic Asset Allocation                                                                                            181


into domestic and foreign government bonds, creates four bond categories. For these
categories, risk–return expectations can be expressed and correlations with other
asset classes (and, in an asset–liability management context, with the liabilities) can
be estimated. An investment manager who wants to explicitly consider the risk–return
characteristics of those bond categories in the strategic asset allocation may choose to
treat them as distinct asset classes. Similarly, in equities, some investors distinguish
between emerging market and developed market equities, between domestic and
international equities, or between large-cap and small-cap equities. In some regulatory
environments for institutional investors, asset class definitions are mandatory, thereby
forcing investment managers to articulate risk–return expectations (and apply risk
management) on the asset classes specified. Conversely, a broader categorization of
asset classes leaves the allocation between different categories of bonds and equities,
for example, to managers responsible for these asset classes.
     When defining asset classes, a number of criteria apply. Intuitively, an asset class
should contain relatively homogeneous assets while providing diversification relative
to other asset classes. In statistical terms, risk and return expectations should be sim-
ilar, and paired correlations of assets should be relatively high within an asset class
but should be lower versus assets in other asset classes. Also, the asset classes, while
being mutually exclusive, should add up to a sufficient approximation of the relevant
investable universe. Applying these criteria ensures that the strategic asset allocation
process has considered all available investment alternatives.

    EXAMPLE 9

      Specifying Asset Classes
      The strategic asset allocations of many institutional investors make a distinction
      between domestic equities and international equities or between developed
      market equities and emerging market equities. Often, equities are separated
      into different market capitalization brackets, resulting, for example, in an asset
      class such as domestic small-cap equity.
          The correlation matrix in Exhibit 5 shows the paired correlations of monthly
      returns between different equity asset classes and other asset classes. Specifically,
      these correlations are measured over the period from December 2000 through
      August 2018. In addition, the exhibit shows the annualized volatility of monthly
      returns.

                                          Based only on the information given, address the following:

                                      1. Contrast the correlations between equity asset classes with the correlations
                                         between equity asset classes and US Treasuries.

                                      Solution:
                                         The matrix reveals very strong correlation between the equity asset classes.
                                         For example, the correlation between European equities and US equities is
                                         0.88. The correlation of equities with bonds, however, is much lower. For
                                         example, US equities, emerging markets equities, European equities, and
                                         Japanese equities all have negative correlation with US government bonds
                                         (–0.37, –0.24 and –0.28, and –0.18, respectively). It is worth noting, how-
                                         ever, that correlations can vary through time and the values shown may be
                                         specific to the sample period used.

                                      2. The monthly returns of which equity asset class differ the most from US
                                         equities?

                                      Solution:
                                         Among equity asset classes as listed in the table, the correlation between
                                         US and Japanese equities is the lowest, at 0.59. By contrast, correlations
                                         between US equities and emerging markets, European, and US small cap
                                         equities are 0.78 or higher.

                                       Using correlation as a metric, Example 9 tends to indicate that only emerging
                                   markets were well differentiated from European equities. So, why do investors still
                                   often subdivide equities? Apart from any regulatory reasons, one explanation might
                                   be that this decomposition into smaller asset classes corresponds to the way the asset
                                   allocation is structured in portfolios. Many investment managers have expertise exclu-
                                   sively in specific areas of the market, such as emerging market equities, US small-cap
                                   equity, or international investment-grade credit. Bringing the asset class definitions of
                                   the asset allocation in line with investment products actually available in the market
                                   may simplify matters from an organizational perspective.

Strategic Asset Allocation                                                                   183


    The risk–return profile of the strategic asset allocation depends on the expected
returns and risks of the individual asset classes, as well as the correlation between
those asset classes. In general, adding assets classes with low correlation improves
the risk–return trade-off (more return for similar risk). Typically, the strategic asset
allocation for risk-averse investors will have a large weight in government bonds and
cash, whereas those with more willingness and ability to take risk will have more of their
assets in risky asset classes, such as equities and many types of alternative investments.
    It is customary to represent asset classes using benchmarks and universes cal-
culated by providers such as FTSE, MSCI, or Bloomberg. A negative screening or a
best-in-class policy (discussed previously) limits the number of securities to choose
from, potentially impacting the risk and expected return estimates for these asset
classes. Some examples of exclusions may be controversial weaponry or tobacco
companies, or investments in certain countries. When such exclusions apply, risk and
return estimates based on non-traditional (“off-the-shelf ”) asset class benchmarks
may not be applicable. Separate benchmark indices reflecting the exclusions may be
available from the providers to mitigate this issue.

                          A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and objectives artic-
                          ulated in the IPS and long-term capital market expectations regarding the asset classes.
                          The strategic asset allocation or policy portfolio will subsequently be implemented
                          into real portfolios. Exhibit 7 illustrates conceptually how investment objectives and
                          constraints and long-term capital market expectations combine into a policy portfolio.

                          In some frameworks used in practice, the asset allocation is an integral part of the
                          investment policy statement. This presentation, however, keeps the asset allocation
                          separate from the investment policy statement because clients’ investment objectives
                          and constraints qualitatively differ in nature from capital market expectations, thus
                          requiring different types of analysis, different sources of information, and different
                          review cycles.
                              The combination of investment objectives/constraints and capital market expec-
                          tations theoretically occurs using optimization techniques. In this section, we apply
                          mean–variance optimization to a sample set of investment objectives and constraints,
                          using an investment universe with associated market expectations. We assume that
                          investors choosing from a range of asset allocations with similar returns would prefer
                          those with lower risk. Choosing from allocations with similar levels of risk, inves-
                          tors would prefer those with the highest return. Formally, investors’ risk and return
                          objectives can be described as a utility function, in which utility increases with higher
                          expected returns and lower risk. This assumption could yield an expected utility
                          equation such as that shown in Equation 1.4

Strategic Asset Allocation                                                                    185


   where

        Up = the investor’s expected utility from the portfolio

   E(Rp) = the expected return of the portfolio

        σp = the standard deviation of returns of the portfolio

          λ = a measure of the investor’s risk aversion
    This utility function expresses a positive relationship between utility and expected
portfolio return (i.e., higher expected return increases utility, all else equal) and a
negative relationship between utility and volatility of portfolio return as measured by
the variance of portfolio returns. The stronger the negative relationship, the greater
the investor’s risk aversion. The portfolio is understood to represent a particular asset
allocation. The asset allocation providing the highest expected utility is the one that
is optimal for the investor given his or her risk aversion.
    For different values of Up, a line can be plotted that links those combinations of
risk and expected return that produces that level of utility: an indifference curve. An
investor would attain equal utility from all risk–return combinations on that curve.
    Capital market expectations, specified in asset classes’ expected returns, standard
deviations of return, and correlations, translate into an efficient frontier of portfolios.
A multi-asset class portfolio’s expected return is given by
                       n
   	​E​(
       ​ ​Rp​ ​)​​ = ∑
                     ​ ​w​i​E​(​ ​Ri​​)​​	                                            (2)
                     i=1

   where wi equals the weight of asset class i in the portfolio, and its risk is given by
                _______________________


            √
                 n n
   	​σ​p​ = ​ ​∑         ​ ​p,j​Cov​(
                ​∑​w​p,i​w
                                    ​ ​Ri​​, ​Rj​​)​​	                                (3)
                i=1 j=1

The covariance between the returns on asset classes i and j is given by the product of
the correlation between the two asset classes and their standard deviations of return:
   Cov(Ri,Rj) = ρi,jσiσj                                                              (4)
where

   Cov(Ri,Rj) = the covariance between the return of asset classes i and j

                ρi,j = the correlation between the returns of asset classes i and j
    The resulting portfolios can be represented as a scatter of dots in a chart depict-
ing their risk and expected return. Because a portfolio’s risk is a positive function
of the risk of its assets and the correlations among them, a portfolio consisting of
risky assets with low correlation has lower risk than one with similarly risky assets
with high correlation. It is therefore possible to construct different portfolios with
equal expected returns but with different levels of risk. The line that connects those
portfolios with the minimal risk for each level of expected return (above that of the
minimum-variance portfolio—the portfolio with the minimum variance for each
given level of expected return) is the efficient frontier. Clearly, the efficient frontier
will move “upward” as more low-correlation assets with sufficient expected return
are added to the mix because it lowers the risk in the portfolios for equal expected
returns. Similarly, when return expectations increase for asset classes while volatility
and correlation assumptions remain unchanged, the efficient frontier will move upward
because each portfolio is able to generate higher returns for the same level of risk.
    Both the efficient frontier and a range of indifference curves can be plotted in the
risk–return space. In Exhibit 8, the dark-colored curves that are concave from below
represent efficient frontiers associated with different assumed expected returns. The
lighter-colored curves are indifference curves. The point where the efficient frontier

                          intersects with the indifference curve with the highest utility attainable (i.e., the point
                          of tangency) represents the optimal asset allocation for the client/investor. In Exhibit
                          8, efficient frontier 1 has a point of tangency with indifference curve 1. Higher levels
                          of utility, such as those associated with indifference curve 0, can apparently not be
                          reached with the assets underlying the efficient frontier. It is clear that when capital
                          market expectations change, this change moves the efficient frontier away from its
                          original location. In the chart, this movement is illustrated by efficient frontier 2,
                          which incorporates different capital market expectations. This new efficient frontier
                          has a point of tangency with indifference curve 2, which is associated with a lower
                          level of expected utility. Because the point of tangency represents the strategic asset
                          allocation, it implies the asset allocation should be adjusted. Similarly, should invest-
                          ment objectives or constraints change, the indifference curves will change their shape
                          and location. This change will again move the point of tangency, and hence change
                          the asset allocation.

                          This framework describes how investor objectives and capital market expectations
                          should theoretically be reconciled. It will, however, not be the exact procedure that
                          in practice will be followed. First, an IPS does not necessarily translate the client’s
                          investment objectives and constraint into a utility function. Rather, an IPS gives
                          threshold levels for risk and expected return, combined with a number of additional
                          constraints that cannot be captured in this model. Second, the model illustrated is a
                          single-period model, whereas in practice, the constraints from the IPS will make it
                          more appropriate to use multi-period models. Multi-period problems can be more

EXAMPLE 10

  Approaching a SAA for a Private Investor

  1. Rainer Gottschalk recently sold his local home construction company in
     the south of Germany to a large homebuilder with a nationwide reach.
     Upon selling his company, he accepted a job as regional manager for that
     nationwide homebuilder. Gottschalk is now considering his and his family’s
     financial future. He looks forward to his new job—he likes his new role,
     and the position provides him with income to fulfill his family’s short-term
     and medium-term liquidity needs. Gottschalk feels strongly that he should
     not invest the proceeds of the sale of his company in real estate because his
     income already depends on the state of the real estate market. Also, reflect-
     ing family values, he feels strongly that his savings should not support the
     tobacco industry. He therefore wants his equity allocation to exclude any
     stocks of tobacco product manufacturers or retailers. Gottschalk consults
     a financial adviser from his bank about how to invest his money to retire in
     good wealth in 20 years.

     The IPS developed by his adviser suggests a return objective of 5%, with a
     standard deviation of 10%. The bank’s asset management division provides
     Gottschalk and his adviser with the following data (Exhibit 9, Panel 1) on
     market expectations. The adviser estimates that excluding the tobacco
     industry from the investment universe affects expected equity returns of
     European equities by –0.2% and annual standard deviation by +0.1%. The
     impact on emerging market equities, and on the correlation structure, was
     considered negligible. Gottschalk accepts the results of these calculations as
     shown in Exhibit 9, Panel 2.

                                To illustrate the possibilities, the adviser presents Gottschalk with the fol-
                                lowing plot (Exhibit 10), in which the points forming the shaded curve out-
                                line the risk–return characteristics of the portfolios that can be constructed
                                out of the three asset classes. An imaginary line linking the points with the
                                lowest standard deviation for each attainable level of return would be the
                                efficient frontier. The two straight lines show the risk and return objectives.
                                Gottschalk should aim for portfolios that offer an expected return of at least
                                6% (the straight horizontal line or above) and a standard deviation of return
                                of 12% or lower (the straight vertical line to the left).

                                Exhibit 10 shows that no portfolio satisfies the two objectives (return of 5%
                                and standard deviation of 10%) exactly, because the highest expected return
                                that can be attained at a maximum volatility of 10% is 4.9%. This difference,
                                Gottschalk and the adviser agree, is acceptable. The portfolio that would
                                correspond with this expected return consists of 16% European stocks, 38%
                                emerging market equities, and 46% government bonds.




              8           PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES

                                            describe the principles of portfolio construction and the role of asset
                                            allocation in relation to the IPS

                          The strategic asset allocation in itself does not yet represent an actual investment
                          portfolio. It is the first step in implementing an investment strategy. For quantitatively
                          oriented portfolio managers, the next step is often risk budgeting.
                              As used in this reading, risk budgeting is the process of deciding on the amount
                          of risk to assume in a portfolio (the overall risk budget) and subdividing that risk
                          over the sources of investment return (e.g., strategic asset allocation, tactical asset

Portfolio Construction Principles                                                            189


allocation, and security selection). Because the decision about the total amount of
risk to be taken is made in constructing the IPS, at this stage we are concerned about
the subdivision of that risk.
    Apart from the exposures to systematic risk factors specified in the strategic asset
allocation, the returns of an investment strategy depend on two other sources: tac-
tical asset allocation and security selection. Tactical asset allocation is the decision
to deliberately deviate from the policy exposures to systematic risk factors (i.e., the
policy weights of asset classes) with the intent to add value based on forecasts of
the near-term returns of those asset classes. For instance, an investor may decide to
temporarily invest more of the portfolio in equities than the SAA prescribes if the
investor anticipates that equities will deliver a higher return over the short term than
other asset classes. Security selection is an attempt to generate higher returns than
the asset class benchmark by selecting securities with a higher expected return. For
example, an investment manager may decide to add more IBM stock in her portfolio
than the weight in her equity benchmark if she expects this stock to do better than
the benchmark. To fund this purchase, she may sell another stock expected to do
worse than either the benchmark or IBM. Obviously, deciding to deviate from pol-
icy weights or to select securities aiming to beat the benchmark creates additional
uncertainty about returns. This risk is over and above the risk inherent in the policy
portfolio. Hence, an investment policy should set risk limits and desired payoffs for
each of these three activities.
    Risk budgeting implies that the portfolio manager has to choose, for every asset
class, whether to deploy security selection as a return generator. This choice is gen-
erally referred to as the choice between active or passive management. Contrary to
strategic asset allocation, where exposures to sources of systematic risk are selected
and sized, security selection is not rewarded with a long-run payoff to risk. Security
selection is a zero-sum game: All investors in an asset class are competing with each
other to identify a typically limited number of assets that are misvalued. In total, the
gross returns of all market participants average out to the market return (the reward
for taking systematic risk). This implies that the average active investor will match
the market return and that one investor’s gain versus the market return is the other
investor’s loss versus the market return. Because active managers tend to trade more
and have to pay people (including themselves) to generate investment ideas or infor-
mation leading to such ideas, however, the average active manager will underperform
the market, net of costs. This fact does not imply that there are no skillful investment
managers who, with some consistency, beat their benchmarks. Neither does it imply
that all passive managers will be able to match the benchmark. The higher the turnover
of an index, the more trading costs a passive manager will incur, making the task of
matching the return of an index more difficult.
    The likelihood of adding a significant amount of value from security selection
depends on the skills of the manager and the informational efficiency of the market
for the asset class his skill relates to. The more efficient an asset class or a subset of
that asset class (such as a regional stock, bond, or real estate market or a size category
within the stock market), the more skillful an asset manager has to be to add value.
Broadly speaking, an efficient market is a market in which prices, on average, very
quickly reflect newly available information. That requires a sizeable participation of
investors trading risk against expected return, acting on rational expectations, using
the same or similar pricing models, and having equal opportunities to access rele-
vant information. Clearly, the market for US large-capitalization equities would be
quite efficient. By contrast, some regional bond and equity markets do not have the
technical and regulatory systems for information dissemination that are sufficient to
serve all investors on a timely basis. Skilled managers should be able to exploit the
resulting inefficiencies.

                               Sometimes the choice between active and passive management is actually made
                          implicitly when the asset class is included in the asset allocation. The markets for
                          some assets—such as those for non-listed real estate and infrastructure assets—are so
                          illiquid that it is very difficult to buy a diversified exposure. As a result, participating
                          in that market is not possible without engaging in security selection.
                               As the portfolio is constructed and its value changes with the returns of the asset
                          classes and securities in which it is invested, the weights of the asset classes will grad-
                          ually deviate from the policy weights in the strategic asset allocation. This process is
                          referred to as drift. Periodically, or when a certain threshold deviation from the policy
                          weight (the bandwidth) has been breached, the portfolio should be rebalanced back to
                          the policy weights. The set of rules that guide the process of restoring the portfolio’s
                          original exposures to systematic risk factors is known as the rebalancing policy. Even
                          absent a formal risk budget, formulating a rebalancing policy is an important element
                          of risk management, as the following example illustrates.

                                 As Exhibit 11 reveals, the charity has a policy that the asset class weights
                             cannot deviate from the policy weights by more than 2% (the corridor). The
                             resulting upper and lower limits for the asset class weights are shown in the
                             rightmost columns of the table. There are two reasons for asset class actual
                             weights to deviate from policy weights: by deliberate choice (tactical asset
                             allocation or market timing) and as a result of divergence of the returns of the
                             different asset classes (drift). In this example, the asset class weights start the
                             year exactly in line with policy weights.
                                 After half a year, the investment portfolio is as shown in Exhibit 12.

       1. Discuss the returns of the portfolio and comment on the main asset weight
          changes.

       Solution to 1:
            The investment portfolio generated a return calculated on beginning (poli-
            cy) weights of 6.55%, rounded to 6.6% (= 0.30 × 15% + 0.15 × 10% + 0.20 ×
            0.5% + 0.20 × 1.5% + 0.15 × 1.0%), mainly driven by a strong equity market.
            Bond returns were more subdued, leading to considerable drift in asset class
            weights. In particular, the European equity weight breached the upper limit
            of its allowed actual weight.

       2. The investment committee decides against reducing European equities back
          to policy weight and adding to the fixed income and cash investments to-
          ward policy weights. Although this rebalancing would be prudent, the com-
          mittee decides to engage in tactical asset allocation based on the view that
          this market will continue to be strong over the course of the year. It decides
          to just bring European equities back to within its bandwidth (a 32% portfolio
          weight) and add the proceeds to cash. Exhibit 13 shows the outcome after
          another half year.

            The prior decision not to rebalance to policy weights did not have a positive
            result. Contrary to the investment committee’s expectations, both European
            and international equities performed poorly while bonds recovered. The
            return of the portfolio was −2.0%.

            How much of this return can be attributed to tactical asset allocation?

                             Solution to 2:
                                Because tactical asset allocation is the deliberate decision to deviate from
                                policy weights, the return contribution from tactical asset allocation equals
                                the difference between the actual return and the return that would have
                                been made if the asset class weights were equal to the policy weights. Exhib-
                                it 14 shows this difference to be −0.30%.

                              The process of executing an investment strategy continues with selecting the appro-
                          priate manager(s) for each asset class and allocating funds to them. The investment
                          portfolio management process is then well into the execution stage.
                              The investment managers’ performance will be monitored, as well as the results
                          of the tactical and strategic asset allocation. When asset class weights move outside
                          their corridors, money is transferred from the asset classes that have become too large
                          compared with the SAA to those that fall short. Managers as well as the strategic asset
                          allocation will be reviewed on the basis of the outcome of the monitoring process.
                          In addition, capital market expectations may change, as may the circumstances and
                          objectives of the client. These changes could result in an adjustment of the strategic
                          asset allocation.


                          New Developments in Portfolio Management
                          The portfolio planning and construction framework presented so far relies on a some-
                          what rigid process. Nonetheless, there are two newer, less structured developments
                          that deserve specific mention.
                              The first development is the growth in the offering of exchange traded funds, or
                          ETFs, in combination with algorithm-based financial advice (or robo-advice). ETFs
                          are funds that track the performance of an asset class index or sub-index, are easily
                          tradable, and are relatively cheap compared with actively managed funds or managed
                          accounts. The broad array of ETF offerings, covering the main equity and fixed-income
                          indices as well as commodities, enable retail investors to obtain fast, inexpensive, and
                          liquid exposure to asset classes. Robo-advice has further reduced the costs for retail
                          investors to create a well-diversified portfolio.
                              The second development relates to criticism of asset class return forecasts over
                          relevant time horizons, as well as the perceived instability of asset class correlations
                          and volatilities. Some market participants argue that poor investment portfolio results
                          reflect the sensitivity of modern portfolio theory-based portfolio construction meth-
                          odologies to small errors in return forecasts or estimated correlations. In response,
                          practitioners developed an investment approach where asset classes were weighted

according to risk contribution. This approach is known as risk parity investing.
Proponents of risk parity investing argue that traditionally constructed portfolios
have considerable risk from equities. That is, the typically high (60% or more) weight
of equities in institutional portfolios understates the risk impact: equities tend to be
much more volatile than fixed income. Opponents of risk parity argue that following
the global financial crisis of 2007–2009, favorable results of risk parity portfolios
were caused by the long period of decline in interest rates that benefited bond market
performance.




ESG CONSIDERATIONS IN PORTFOLIO PLANNING
AND CONSTRUCTION                                                                           9
              describe how environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
              considerations may be integrated into portfolio planning and
              construction

The implementation of a policy on responsible investing affects both strategic asset
allocation and implementation of the portfolio construction process. The ESG invest-
ment approaches described previously require a set of instructions for investment
managers with regard to the selection of securities, the exercise of shareholder rights,
and the selection of investment strategies. Examples of issues driving the integration
of environmental and social factors in the investment process include scarcity of
natural resources, physical impacts of climate change, global economic and demo-
graphic trends, diversity and inclusion, and the rise of social media. ESG investment
approaches can be implemented with structured, numeric data for many of these
issues (e.g., executive salaries and bonuses, carbon footprint, employee turnover, lost
time injuries and fatalities, and employee absenteeism). Although companies often
are not required to disclose such data, that is changing as many stock exchanges and
other regulatory bodies across developed and emerging markets have set up guidelines
related to corporate sustainability disclosures for listed companies. In addition, many
organizations and regulatory bodies have derived frameworks setting out standards on
a number of these issues—examples include the Principles of Responsible Investment,
the UN Global Compact, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
These standards help form the basis of responsible investing policies for asset owners.
In turn, asset owners may exclude or engage with companies in accordance with these
issues, or demand from their selected investment managers consider these issues in
their investment process.
    We previously discussed that the limitation in the investment universe from using
negative screening policies affects the expected returns and risk. When selecting or
instructing active or passive managers, these managers will clearly prefer to see their
performance measured against a benchmark that reflects the limited universe. There
are benchmarks and investment vehicles (both active and passive) available, partic-
ularly in equities, that reflect many commonly excluded companies or sectors. It is
also worth noting that with the proliferation of the ESG integration approach, more
and more asset owners expect their asset managers to beat the regular benchmarks,
because integration of ESG factors into traditional financial analysis and portfolio
construction is viewed more as a process enhancement rather than an entirely new
way to invest.

                             1. Based in South Africa, Mountain Materials (Mountain) is a fictitious ce-
                                ment manufacturing company that ranks as one of the largest cement and
                                concrete manufacturers in the world. Mountain operates mostly in South
                                Africa, where environmental regulations have been gradually strengthening
                                since 2015. Because of the large scale of its operations, Mountain is a signif-
                                icant emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs). During 2019, by setting a carbon
                                price on the country's largest GHG emitters, South Africa launched a new,
                                crucial endeavor in its efforts to tackle air pollution and climate change.
                                Despite having some ad hoc initiatives to manage its carbon emissions, the
                                company lacks firmwide programs to limit energy use or carbon emissions,
                                thereby remaining exposed to increased costs to offset excess emissions.
                                The average price on carbon across seven pilot markets in South Africa was
                                between $5 and $15 per ton of carbon dioxide. In addition, the company’s
                                performance in managing toxic air emissions as well as employee health and
                                safety falls short of industry best practices, leaving Mountain exposed to
                                related risks.

      emissions, the company would have to switch to relatively cleaner sources of
      energy such as gas-based powered plants. This change is expected to further
      dampen operating margin by 2% because of increased fuel costs. As a result
      of higher spending, it was assumed that the previously stable cash dividend
      policy would turn conservative in the short term, and hence Disha reduced
      the expected dividend from 2% to 0% for the base case. Lastly, there is a
      downside to multiples as a result of the concerns related to management of
      health and safety risks, because the company’s performance is below that of
      its peers and capital markets tend to discount the share price in the event
      of safety incidents. Based on all of these changes, the base case IRR for the
      cement company case became less attractive. This outlook led Disha to
      undertake a relatively smaller position of 0.5% (versus 1.5% in the absence
      of ESG risks) in his portfolio because of the various unmanaged ESG risks
      at Mountain. Disha also decided to engage with company management to
      influence better disclosures and management of these environmental and
      social risks. In this manner, key ESG risks and growth opportunities were
      integrated with traditional financial analysis to help arrive at a more robust
      investment decision.
      In this example, a high level of unmanaged ESG risks led to a significant
      change in expected IRR following the ESG integration and hence impacted
      the position size significantly. It is prudent to note, however, that ESG is one
      of the many factors that influence investment decision making. Therefore, in
      many cases, ESG risk and opportunities may have limited effect on a compa-
      ny’s financial attractiveness and thereby may not cause a large change in the
      portfolio. These risks and opportunities have to be analyzed and interpreted
      on a case-by-case basis.

    Shareholder engagement requires good cooperation between investor (client)
and investment manager. Engagement efforts are time-consuming, and the interest in
such efforts is often that of the clients rather than that of the investment managers.
Clients and investment managers must be clear with each other about the exercise
of voting rights, filing of shareholder proposals, or entering into conversations with
company management. It may be that the engagement and voting is delegated by
the client to the investment manager and implemented according to the manager’s
stewardship policy. Alternatively, the client may instruct some proxy agent to vote
on its behalf and according to its own stewardship policies, or the client may instruct
voting and maintain dialogue with its investee companies through either individual
engagements or collaborative engagements. Collaborative engagement initiatives have
gained popularity because it is easier to gain the attention of and encourage positive
action from corporations on material ESG issues through collective action. Climate
Action 100+ is one such initiative that aims to ensure the world’s largest corporate
GHG emitters take necessary action on climate change. The initiative aims to engage
with more than 100 systemically important carbon emitters, accounting for two-thirds
of annual global industrial emissions, alongside more than 60 other companies with
significant opportunity to drive the clean energy transition.
    Selecting thematic investments, particularly in liquid asset classes, requires finding
specialist managers who can identify the right opportunities and manage thematic
investment portfolios. In particular, an allocation to thematic investments will bias
the total asset class portfolio toward a particular theme, so it is important for the
investment manager to demonstrate the impact of the thematic investment on the
total risk–return profile of the portfolio. Impact investing specifically selects invest-
ment opportunities based on their intention to create a positive environmental and
social impact.

                              The effort and costs associated with limiting the investment universe as part of
                          responsible investing may suggest a negative impact on investment returns. Responsible
                          investing proponents argue, however, that potential improvements in governance, as
                          well as the avoidance of material risks by companies that screen, favorably improve
                          returns. Significant empirical research has been conducted on the performance of
                          ESG factors in equities, including the return differences of ESG equity portfolios
                          relative to mainstream equity portfolios. Academic research remains mixed on the
                          impact of ESG factors on portfolio returns. Nevertheless, ESG investing continues
                          to see strong adoption, with nearly US$31 trillion of AUM dedicated toward respon-
                          sible investment mandates at the start of 2018. The ESG integration approach that
                          integrates material qualitative and quantitative environmental, social, and governance
                          factors into traditional security and industry analysis as well as portfolio construction
                          is now widely adopted across mainstream funds and not just limited to client-specific
                          separate accounts.




                             SUMMARY
                          In this reading, we have discussed construction of a client’s investment policy state-
                          ment, including discussion of risk and return objectives and the various constraints
                          that will apply to the portfolio. We have also discussed the portfolio construction
                          process, with emphasis on the strategic asset allocation decisions that must be made.
                              ■   The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process. Without
                                  a full understanding of the client’s situation and requirements, it is unlikely
                                  that successful results will be achieved.
                              ■   The IPS can take a variety of forms. A typical format will include the client’s
                                  investment objectives and also list the constraints that apply to the client’s
                                  portfolio.
                              ■   The client’s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return
                                  requirements.
                              ■   The constraints section covers factors that need to be considered when
                                  constructing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives. The typical
                                  constraint categories are liquidity requirements, time horizon, regulatory
                                  requirements, tax status, and unique needs.
                              ■   Clients may have personal objections to certain products or practices,
                                  which could lead to the exclusion of certain companies, countries, or types
                                  of securities from the investable universe as well as the client’s benchmark.
                                  Such considerations are often referred to as ESG (environmental, social,
                                  governance).
                              ■   ESG considerations can be integrated into an investment policy by negative
                                  screening, positive screening, ESG integration, thematic investing, engage-
                                  ment/active ownership, and impact investing.
                              ■   Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the risk toler-
                                  ance of the client. Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute, relative, or a
                                  combination of the two.
                              ■   The client’s overall risk tolerance is a function of both the client’s ability
                                  to accept risk and the client’s “risk attitude,” which can be considered the
                                  client’s willingness to take risk.

   ■   The client’s return objectives can be stated on an absolute or a relative basis.
       As an example of an absolute objective, the client may want to achieve a
       particular percentage rate of return. Alternatively, the return objective can
       be stated on a relative basis—for example, relative to a benchmark return.
   ■   The liquidity section of the IPS should state what the client’s requirements
       are to draw cash from the portfolio.
   ■   The time horizon section of the IPS should state the time horizon over
       which the investor is investing. This horizon may be the period during
       which the portfolio is accumulating before any assets need to be withdrawn.
   ■   Tax status varies among investors, and a client’s tax status should be stated
       in the IPS.
   ■   The IPS should state any legal or regulatory restrictions that constrain the
       investment of the portfolio.
   ■   The unique circumstances section of the IPS should cover any other aspect
       of a client’s circumstances that is likely to have a material impact on portfo-
       lio composition. Certain ESG implementation approaches may be discussed
       in this section.
   ■   Asset classes are the building blocks of an asset allocation. An asset class
       is a category of assets that have similar characteristics, attributes, and
       risk–return relationships. Traditionally, investors have distinguished cash,
       equities, bonds, and real estate as the major asset classes.
   ■   A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and
       objectives articulated in the IPS and capital market expectations regarding
       the asset classes.
   ■   As time goes on, a client’s asset allocation will drift from the target alloca-
       tion, and the amount of allowable drift as well as a rebalancing policy should
       be formalized.
   ■   In addition to taking systematic risk, an investment committee may choose
       to take tactical asset allocation risk or security selection risk. The amount of
       return attributable to these decisions can be measured.
   ■   ESG considerations may be integrated into the portfolio planning and con-
       struction process. ESG implementation approaches require a set of instruc-
       tions for investment managers with regard to the selection of securities, the
       exercise of shareholder rights, and the selection of investment strategies.

                          2. Which of the following best describes the underlying rationale for a written in-
                             vestment policy statement (IPS)?
                              A. A written IPS communicates a plan for trying to achieve investment success.

                              B. A written IPS provides investment managers with a ready defense against
                                 client lawsuits.

                              C. A written IPS allows investment managers to instruct clients about the
                                 proper use and purpose of investments.

                          3. A written investment policy statement (IPS) is most likely to succeed if:

                          4. The section of the investment policy statement (IPS) that provides information
                             about how policy may be executed, including restrictions and exclusions, is best
                             described as the:
                              A. Investment Objectives.

                              B. should be included in the IPS.

                              C. makes it illegal for the portfolio manager to work with this client.

                          14. After interviewing a client in order to prepare a written investment policy state-
                              ment (IPS), you have established the following:
                              ■   The client has earnings that vary dramatically between £30,000 and £70,000
                                  (pre-tax) depending on weather patterns in Britain.
                              ■   In three of the previous five years, the after-tax income of the client has
                                  been less than £20,000.
                              ■   The client’s mother is dependent on her son (the client) for approximately
                                  £9,000 per year support.
                              ■   The client’s own subsistence needs are approximately £12,000 per year.
                              ■   The client has more than 10 years’ experience trading investments including
                                  commodity futures, stock options, and selling stock short.
                              ■   The client’s responses to a standard risk assessment questionnaire suggest
                                  he has above average risk tolerance.
                              The client is best described as having a:
                              A. low ability to take risk, but a high willingness to take risk.

                              B. high ability to take risk, but a low willingness to take risk.

                              C. high ability to take risk and a high willingness to take risk.

                          15. After interviewing a client in order to prepare a written investment policy state-
                              ment (IPS), you have established the following:
                              ■   The client has earnings that have exceeded €120,000 (pre-tax) each year for
                                  the past five years.
                              ■   She has no dependents.
                              ■   The client’s subsistence needs are approximately €45,000 per year.
                              ■   The client states that she feels uncomfortable with her lack of understanding
                                  of securities markets.
                              ■   All of the client’s current savings are invested in short-term securities guar-
                                  anteed by an agency of her national government.
                              ■   The client’s responses to a standard risk assessment questionnaire suggest
                                  she has low risk tolerance.
                              The client is best described as having a:
                              A. low ability to take risk, but a high willingness to take risk.

                              B. high ability to take risk, but a low willingness to take risk.

                              C. high ability to take risk and a high willingness to take risk.

                          16. Returns on asset classes are best described as being a function of:
                              A. the failure of arbitrage.

202   Learning Module 4                                            Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction




                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. C is correct. Depending on circumstances, a written IPS or its equivalent may be
                             required by law or regulation and a written IPS is certainly consistent with best
                             practices. The mere fact that a written IPS is prepared for a client, however, does
                             not ensure that risk and return objectives will in fact be achieved.

                          2. A is correct. A written IPS is best seen as a communication instrument allowing
                             clients and portfolio managers to mutually establish investment objectives and
                             constraints.

                          3. B is correct. A written IPS, to be successful, must incorporate a full understand-
                             ing of the client’s situation and requirements. As stated in the reading, “The IPS
                             will be developed following a fact finding discussion with the client.”

                          4. B is correct. The major components of an IPS are listed in Section 2 of the read-
                             ing. Investment Guidelines are described as the section that provides information
                             about how policy may be executed, including restrictions on the permissible use
                             of leverage and derivatives and on specific types of assets excluded from invest-
                             ment, if any. Statement of Duties and Responsibilities “detail[s] the duties and
                             responsibilities of the client, the custodian of the client’s assets, the investment
                             managers, and so forth.” Investment Objectives is “a section explaining the client’s
                             objectives in investing.”

                          5. C is correct. The major components of an IPS are listed in Section 2 of the read-
                             ing. Strategic Asset Allocation (also known as the policy portfolio) and Rebalanc-
                             ing Policy are often included as appendices to the IPS. The Statement of Duties
                             and Responsibilities, however, is an integral part of the IPS and is unlikely to be
                             placed in an appendix.

                          6. B is correct. According to the reading, “The sections of an IPS that are most
                             closely linked to the client’s distinctive needs are those dealing with investment
                             objectives and constraints.” Investment Guidelines “[provide] information about
                             how policy may be executed, including investment constraints.” Procedures “[de-
                             tail] the steps to be taken to keep the IPS current and the procedures to follow
                             to respond to various contingencies.” Statement of Duties and Responsibilities
                             “detail[s] the duties and responsibilities of the client, the custodian of the client’s
                             assets, the investment managers, and so forth.”

                          7. A is correct. Because the return objective specifies a target return relative to the
                             FTSE 100 Index, the objective is best described as a relative return objective.

                          8. C is correct. Risk attitude is a subjective factor and measuring risk attitude is
                             difficult. Oftentimes, investment managers use psychometric questionnaires,
                             such as those developed by Grable and Joo (2004), to assess a client’s willingness
                             to take risk.

                          9. B is correct. The reference to the DAX marks this response as a relative risk
                             objective. Value at risk establishes a minimum value of loss expected during a
                             specified time period at a given level of probability. A statement of maximum
                             allowed absolute loss (€2.5 million) is an absolute risk objective.

                          10. C is correct. Measuring willingness to take risk (risk tolerance, risk aversion) is an
                              exercise in applied psychology. Instruments attempting to measure risk attitudes
                              exist, but they are clearly less objective than measurements of ability to take risk.

Solutions                                                                                    203


   Ability to take risk is based on relatively objective traits such as expected income,
   time horizon, and existing wealth relative to liabilities.

11. A is correct. The client’s financial objectives are long term. Her stable employ-
    ment indicates that her immediate liquidity needs are modest. The children will
    not go to college until 10 or more years later. Her time horizon is best described
    as being long term.

12. B is correct. The unpredictable nature of property and casualty (P&C) claims
    forces P&C insurers to allocate a substantial proportion of their investments into
    liquid, short maturity assets. This need for liquidity also forces P&C companies to
    accept investments with relatively low expected returns. Liquidity is of less con-
    cern to life insurance companies given the greater predictability of life insurance
    payouts.

13. B is correct. When a client has a restriction in trading, such as this obligation to
    refrain from trading, the IPS “should note this constraint so that the portfolio
    manager does not inadvertently trade the stock on the client’s behalf.”

14. A is correct. The volatility of the client’s income and the significant support needs
    for his mother and himself suggest that the client has a low ability to take risk.
    The client’s trading experience and his responses to the risk assessment question-
    naire indicate that the client has an above average willingness to take risk.

15. B is correct. On the one hand, the client has a stable, high income and no depen-
    dents. On the other hand, she exhibits above average risk aversion. Her ability to
    take risk is high, but her willingness to take risk is low.

16. C is correct. Strategic asset allocation depends on several principles. As stated in
    the reading, “One principle is that a portfolio’s systematic risk accounts for most
    of its change in value over the long run.” A second principle is that, “the returns
    to groups of like assets… predictably reflect exposures to certain sets of systemat-
    ic factors.” This latter principle establishes that returns on asset classes primarily
    reflect the systematic risks of the classes.

17. A is correct. The correlation between US equities and Brazilian equities is 0.76.
    The correlations between US equities and East Asian equities and the correlation
    between US equities and European equities both exceed 0.76. Lower correlations
    indicate a greater degree of separation between asset classes. Therefore, using
    solely the data given in the table, returns on Brazilian equities are most sharply
    distinguished from returns on US equities.

18. C is correct. As the reading states, “an asset class should contain homogeneous
    assets… paired correlations of securities would be high within an asset class, but
    should be lower versus securities in other asset classes.”

19. B is correct. Tactical asset allocation allows actual asset allocation to deviate from
    that of the strategic asset allocation (policy portfolio) of the IPS. Tactical asset
    allocation attempts to take advantage of temporary dislocations from the market
    conditions and assumptions that drove the policy portfolio decision.

INTRODUCTION
Research has demonstrated that when people face complex decisions, they often
                                                                                          1
rely on basic judgments and preferences to simplify the situation rather than acting
completely rationally. Although such approaches are quick and intuitively appealing,
they may lead to suboptimal outcomes. In contrast to this body of research, traditional
economic and financial theory generally assumes that individuals act rationally by
considering all available information in the decision-making process, leading them
to optimal outcomes and supporting the efficiency of markets. Behavioral finance
challenges these assumptions by incorporating research on how individuals and mar-
kets actually behave. In this reading, we explore a foundational concept of behavioral
finance: behavioral biases. Investment professionals may be able to improve economic
outcomes by understanding these biases, recognizing them in themselves and others,
and learning strategies to mitigate them.
    The reading proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes and broadly characterizes
behavioral biases. Sections 3 and 4 discuss specific behavioral biases within two broad
categories: cognitive errors and emotional biases. The discussion includes a descrip-
tion of each bias, potential consequences, and guidance on detecting and mitigating
the effects of the bias. Section 5 discusses market anomalies, which are essentially
aggregate expressions of individual biases among financial market participants. A
summary and practice problems conclude the reading.

206   Learning Module 5                                                    The Behavioral Biases of Individuals




              2           BEHAVIORAL BIAS CATEGORIES

                                        compare and contrast cognitive errors and emotional biases

                          In general, behavioral biases come in two forms: faulty cognitive reasoning, known
                          as cognitive errors, and those based on feelings or emotions, known as emotional
                          biases. Both forms of bias, regardless of their source, may cause decisions to deviate
                          from what is assumed by traditional finance theory.
                              Cognitive errors can often be corrected or eliminated through better information,
                          education, and advice. Emotional biases, on the other hand, are harder to correct
                          because they stem from impulses and intuitions. They arise spontaneously rather
                          than through conscious effort and may even be undesired to the individual feeling
                          them. Thus, it is often possible only to recognize an emotional bias and adapt to it.
                          The cognitive–emotional distinction will help us determine when and how to adjust
                          for behavioral biases in financial decision making.
                              Researchers have identified numerous behavioral biases. This reading does not
                          attempt to catalog all of them. Rather, it discusses some of the more publicized and
                          recognized biases within the cognitive–emotional framework. Additionally, we limit
                          our focus to gauging the presence or absence—not the magnitude—of each bias dis-
                          cussed. That is, we will not try to measure how strongly the bias is exhibited, but rather
                          we will describe the behavioral bias, its potential consequences, and the detection of
                          and correction for the behavioral bias. In detecting a bias, we will identify statements
                          or thought processes that may indicate the bias. Diagnostic tests of varying degrees
                          of complexity are available to detect biases but are beyond the scope of this reading.
                              Finally, the individuals of interest in this reading are “financial market participants”
                          (FMPs) engaged in financial decision making. These include both individual investors
                          and financial services professionals.




              3           COGNITIVE ERRORS

                                        discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their
                                        implications for financial decision making

                          We classify cognitive errors into two categories: “belief perseverance biases” and
                          “processing errors.”
                              Belief perseverance is the tendency to cling to one’s previously held beliefs by
                          committing statistical, information-processing, or memory errors. The belief perse-
                          verance biases discussed are conservatism, confirmation, representativeness, illusion
                          of control, and hindsight.
                              Processing errors describe how information may be processed and used illogi-
                          cally or irrationally in financial decision making. The processing errors discussed are
                          anchoring and adjustment, mental accounting, framing, and availability.

Cognitive Errors                                                                              207



Belief Perseverance Biases
Belief perseverance biases result from the mental discomfort that occurs when new
information conflicts with previously held beliefs or cognitions, known as cognitive
dissonance. To resolve this discomfort, people may ignore or modify conflicting infor-
mation and consider only information that confirms their existing beliefs or thoughts.

Conservatism Bias
Conservatism bias is a belief perseverance bias in which people maintain their
prior views or forecasts by inadequately incorporating new, conflicting information.
In Bayesian terms, they tend to overweight their prior probability of the event and
underweight the new information, resulting in revised beliefs about probabilities and
outcomes that underreact to the new information.

Consequences of Conservatism Bias
As a result of conservatism bias, FMPs may do the following:
    ■   Maintain or be slow to update a view or a forecast, even when presented
        with new information; and
    ■   Maintain a prior belief rather than deal with the mental stress of updating
        beliefs given complex data. This behavior relates to an underlying difficulty
        in processing new information.

Detection of and Guidance for Overcoming Conservatism Bias
The effect of conservatism bias may be corrected for or reduced by properly analyzing
and weighting new information. The first step is to be aware that a bias exists, especially
about information that is technical, abstract, and/or statistical, because the cognitive
cost involved in processing those forms of information is higher than for other types.
     When new information is presented, the FMP should ask such questions as, “How
does this information change my forecast?” or “What effect does this information have
on my forecast?” FMPs should conduct careful analysis incorporating the new infor-
mation and then respond appropriately. This updating of prior beliefs in light of new
information is consistent with the tenets of Bayes’ Rule, in which updated probabilities
are derived by systematically combining previous estimates and new information.
     If information is difficult to interpret or understand, FMPs should seek guidance
from someone who can either explain how to interpret the information or can explain
its implications.

Confirmation Bias
Confirmation bias refers to the tendency to look for and notice what confirms prior
beliefs and to ignore or undervalue whatever contradicts them. A response to cog-
nitive dissonance, confirmation bias reflects a predisposition to justify to ourselves
what we want to believe.
    Most experienced private wealth advisers have dealt with a client who conducts
some research and insists on adding a particular investment to the portfolio. The client
may insist on continuing to hold the investment, even when the adviser recommends
otherwise, because the client’s follow-up research seeks only information that con-
firms his belief that the investment is still a good value. The confirmation bias is not
limited to individual investors; all FMPs should be wary of the potential confirmation
biases within themselves.

208   Learning Module 5                                                    The Behavioral Biases of Individuals


                           EXAMPLE 1

                             Confirmation Bias
                             A portfolio manager at Sarter Investment Advisors recommended shares of
                             Real Media Inc., a hypothetical television production and distribution company,
                             largely on the basis of compelling analytical and valuation work from a top
                             equity research analyst. Sarter’s clients have owned the shares for several years.
                                 Recently, the shares have underperformed significantly as a result of the
                             company missing analysts’ earnings estimates and also in response to executive
                             management turnover. The portfolio manager’s colleagues believe this under-
                             performance is a result of Real Media losing market share to a competitor with
                             superior technology and distribution. The competitor is publicly traded, but
                             Sarter’s portfolio managers and analysts have not done research on it.
                                 After another poor earnings release from Real Media, the portfolio manager
                             speaks with the equity research analyst whose work was the primary source of
                             the investment. The equity research analyst, who maintains a buy rating on the
                             stock, believes that Real Media is now a more compelling investment than ever
                             because its share price has fallen while its earnings estimates remain unchanged.
                             As a result of the conversation, the portfolio manager feels reassured and holds
                             the position.
                                 The portfolio manager is subject to confirmation bias. Rather than speaking
                             with a research analyst who has a sell rating on the stock or conducting research
                             on the competitor to consider a different perspective, the portfolio manager
                             speaks with someone who has an opinion she already shares.


                          Consequences of Confirmation Bias
                          As a result of confirmation bias, FMPs may do the following:
                              ■   Consider only the positive information about an existing investment while
                                  ignoring any negative information about the investment.
                              ■   Develop screening criteria while ignoring information that either refutes
                                  the validity of the criteria or supports other criteria. As a result, some good
                                  investments that do not meet the screening criteria may be ignored, and
                                  conversely, some bad investments that do meet the screening criteria may
                                  be made.
                              ■   Under-diversify portfolios. FMPs may become convinced of the value of
                                  a single company’s stock. They ignore negative news, and they gather and
                                  process only information confirming that the company is a good investment.
                                  They build a larger position than appropriate and hold an under-diversified
                                  portfolio.
                              ■   Hold a disproportionate amount of their investment assets in their employ-
                                  ing company’s stock, because they believe in their company and are
                                  convinced of its favorable prospects. Favorable information is cited, and
                                  unfavorable information is ignored. If the employee were to acknowledge
                                  unfavorable information, the associated mental discomfort might make
                                  work very difficult for the employee.

                          Detection of and Guidance for Overcoming Confirmation Bias
                          The effect of confirmation bias may be corrected for or reduced by actively seeking
                          out information that challenges existing beliefs.

Cognitive Errors                                                                              209


    Another useful step is to corroborate an investment decision. For example, if
investment selections are based on criteria confirming an existing belief, such as stocks
breaking through 52-week highs, it is usually advisable to corroborate that decision
with research from another perspective or source (e.g., fundamental research on the
company, industry, or sector).

Representativeness Bias
Representativeness bias refers to the tendency to classify new information based
on past experiences and classifications. New information may resemble or seem
representative of familiar elements already classified, but in reality, it can be very dif-
ferent. In these instances, the classification reflex can deceive, producing an incorrect
understanding that biases all future thinking about the information. Base-rate neglect
and sample-size neglect are two types of representativeness bias that apply to FMPs.
    In base-rate neglect, a phenomenon’s rate of incidence in a larger population—
its base rate—is neglected in favor of specific information. The specific, individual
information may be misleading relative to the more appropriate base rate or general
information. FMPs often follow this erroneous path because diligent research is often
conducted on an individual security or strategy, leading FMPs to overlook or ignore
general information about the “class” to which an investment belongs, such as an
industry, sector, or geography.
    A second type of representativeness bias is sample-size neglect, in which FMPs
incorrectly assume that small sample sizes are representative of populations. Individuals
prone to sample-size neglect are quick to treat properties reflected in small samples as
properties that accurately describe large pools of data, overweighting the information
in the small sample.

EXAMPLE 2

   Representativeness Bias
   Jacques Verte is evaluating the future prospects of APM Company, a large auto
   parts manufacturer having some difficulties. During the last 50 years, very few
   auto part manufacturers have failed, even during periods of difficulty. A number
   of recent headlines have highlighted APM’s business and financial difficulties,
   however, with some commentators suggesting that APM may go out of business.

   1. Which of the following scenarios is more likely? Explain why.
       A. APM will solve its difficulties.
       B. APM will go out of business.
   Solution:
      Scenario A is more likely. The base rate, based on 50 years of data, is that
      more auto parts companies survive difficult times than fail. Thus, it is more
      likely that APM will solve its difficulties than go out of business.

   2. If Verte is subject to representativeness bias, is he more likely to classify
      APM into A or B? Explain why.

   Solution:
      If Verte is subject to representativeness bias, he is likely to choose Scenario
      B, predicting that the company will go out of business because of the head-
      lines he has read. In classifying APM as likely to go out of business, Verte

                                  would be guilty of base-rate neglect by ignoring the low base rate of auto
                                  parts manufacturers failing even during times of difficulty.


                          Consequences of Representativeness Bias
                          As a result of representativeness bias, FMPs may do the following:
                              ■    Adopt a view or a forecast based almost exclusively on individual, specific
                                   information or a small sample; and
                              ■    Update beliefs using simple classifications rather than deal with the mental
                                   stress of updating beliefs given the high cognitive costs of complex data.

                          Detection of and Guidance on Overcoming Representativeness Bias
                          When FMPs sense that base-rate or sample-size neglect may be a problem, they
                          should ask the following question: “What is the probability that X (the investment
                          under consideration) belongs to Group A (the group it resembles or is considered
                          representative of ) versus Group B (the group it is statistically more likely to belong
                          to)?” This question, or a similar question, will help FMPs think through whether they
                          are failing to consider base-rate probabilities or neglecting the law of small numbers
                          and thus inaccurately assessing a particular situation. It may be necessary to do more
                          research to obtain base-rate information and/or widen the sample size of observations.

                          Illusion of Control Bias
                          In illusion of control bias, people tend to believe that they can control or influence
                          outcomes when, in fact, they cannot. Many researchers have uncovered situations
                          where people perceived themselves as possessing more control than they did, inferred
                          causal connections where none existed, or displayed surprisingly great certainty in
                          their predictions for the outcomes of chance events. A classic example is that people
                          prefer choosing their own lottery numbers over random numbers selected for them.

                           EXAMPLE 3

                             Illusion of Control Bias
                             Adelia Scott is a wealth adviser at Sarter Investment Advisors (Sarter), an
                             investment advisory firm for high-net-worth individuals. Scott meets with a
                             client who has 30% of his account in shares of his employer’s stock. The client
                             is not subject to any employee holding requirement.
                                 Prior meeting notes indicate that the client initially agreed to diversify the
                             concentrated position over a five-year period. Scott recommends a faster sched-
                             ule, however, based on recent research indicating that the company’s future
                             growth prospects have considerably worsened as a result of industry trends and
                             macroeconomic conditions.
                                 When presented with this information, the client is reluctant to change his
                             diversification plan, citing the company’s history of double-digit growth and
                             his belief that this rate of growth will continue for the foreseeable future. The
                             client remarks, “Trust me, my team and I are not going to let those forecasts
                             you’re citing come true.”
                                 The client is subject to illusion of control bias. He is unwilling to believe
                             Scott’s opinion because he believes that he and his team can control the com-
                             pany’s performance and stock price.

Consequences of Illusion of Control
As a result of illusion of control bias, FMPs may do the following:
    ■   Inadequately diversify portfolios. Research has found that some investors
        prefer to invest in companies that they feel they have control over, such as
        the companies they work for, leading them to hold concentrated positions.
        In fact, most investors have little or no control over the companies they
        work for. If the company performs poorly, these investors may experience
        both the loss of employment and investment losses.
    ■   Trade more than is prudent. Researchers have found that portfolio turnover
        is negatively correlated with investment returns.
    ■   Construct financial models and forecasts that are overly detailed. FMPs may
        require detailed models before making an investment decision, believing
        that forecasts from these models control uncertainty. Although a greater
        understanding of an investment, issuer, or industry is often useful, increased
        model complexity does not control the inherent risk and uncertainty of
        investment outcomes.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Illusion of Control Bias
The first and most basic idea that investors need to recognize is that investing is
a probabilistic activity. Even the largest investment management firms have little
control over the outcomes of the investments they make. Companies are subject to
macroeconomic and industry forces, as well as the actions of competitors, customers,
and suppliers.
   Second, it is advisable to seek contrary viewpoints. As you contemplate a new
investment, take a moment to think about considerations that might weigh against
making the investment. Ask yourself: What are the downside risks? What might go
wrong? When will I sell? It is often useful to speak with someone who has an opposing
view, such as an equity research analyst with a sell rating on the subject stock.

Hindsight Bias
Hindsight bias refers to believing past events as having been predictable and reasonable
to expect. This behavior results from the obvious fact that outcomes that did occur are
more readily evident than outcomes that did not. Similarly, people tend to remember
their own predictions of the future as more accurate than they actually were because
they are biased by the knowledge of what actually occurred. Poorly reasoned decisions
with positive results may be remembered as brilliant tactical moves, and poor results
of well-reasoned decisions may be described as avoidable mistakes.

EXAMPLE 4

   Hindsight Bias
   Beverly Bolo, an analyst at an investment advisory firm, is giving a presentation
   to clients that, among other topics, explains the firm’s investment results during
   past macroeconomic downturns. In the presentation, Bolo points out that the
   “occurrence of the last recession was obvious upon inspection of the yield curve
   and other leading indicators eight months before the downturn started.”
       Bolo’s comment exhibits hindsight bias. Recessions, like any other event,
   appear obvious in hindsight but are hardly ever accurately predicted. Bolo could
   augment her remarks by exploring how often these leading indicators suggested
   that a recession is imminent against how often a recession subsequently occurred.

                          Consequences of Hindsight Bias
                          As a result of hindsight bias, FMPs may do the following:
                              ■   Overestimate the degree to which they correctly predicted an investment
                                  outcome, or the predictability of an outcome generally. This bias is closely
                                  related to overconfidence bias, which is discussed later in the reading.
                              ■   Unfairly assess money manager or security performance. Based on the abil-
                                  ity to look back at what has taken place in securities markets, performance
                                  is compared against what has happened as opposed to expectations at the
                                  time the investment was made.

                          Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Hindsight Bias
                          Once understood, hindsight bias should be recognizable. FMPs should ask such
                          questions as, “Am I re-writing history or being honest with myself about the mistakes
                          I made?”
                              To guard against hindsight bias, FMPs should carefully record their investment
                          decisions and key reasons for making those decisions in writing at or around the time
                          the decision is made. Consulting these written records rather than memory will often
                          produce a far more accurate examination of past decisions.


                          Processing Errors
                          Processing errors refer to information being processed and used illogically or irratio-
                          nally. As opposed to belief perseverance biases, processing errors are less related to
                          errors of memory or in assigning and updating probabilities; rather, they relate more
                          closely to flaws in how information itself is processed.

                          Anchoring and Adjustment Bias
                          Anchoring and adjustment bias refers to relying on an initial piece of information
                          to make subsequent estimates, judgments, and decisions. When required to estimate
                          a value with unknown magnitude, people generally begin with some initial default
                          number—an “anchor”—which they then adjust up or down. Regardless of how the
                          initial anchor was chosen, people tend to adjust their anchors insufficiently and pro-
                          duce end approximations that are, consequently, biased. Anchoring and adjustment
                          bias is closely related to conservatism bias. Bayes Rule again provides guidance for
                          how new information should be incorporated into changing prior beliefs.

                           EXAMPLE 5

                             Anchoring and Adjustment Bias
                             Aiden Smythe is an equity research analyst at a brokerage firm. Smythe covers
                             Industrial Lift Plc, a company that manufactures construction machinery. The
                             company’s business is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly
                             non-residential construction activity. Last year, Industrial Lift reported £1.00
                             in EPS amid mostly strong non-residential construction activity levels. Smythe
                             is updating his EPS estimate for this year. Non-residential construction activity
                             has severely declined in the last two months, and some economists fear that a
                             recession is likely. As a result, Smythe forecasts that EPS will fall 10% from the
                             prior-year level, publishing a £0.90 estimate for the year.
                                 Smythe’s estimate exhibits anchoring and adjustment. Smythe’s anchor is
                             the prior year’s EPS of £1.00, despite the possibility of a material change in
                             underlying conditions.

Consequences of Anchoring and Adjustment Bias
As a result of anchoring and adjustment bias, FMPs may stick too closely to their
original estimates when learning new information. This mindset is not limited to
downside adjustments; the same phenomenon occurs with upside adjustments as well.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Anchoring and Adjustment Bias
The primary action FMPs can take is consciously asking questions that may reveal an
anchoring and adjustment bias. Examples of such questions include, “Am I holding
onto this stock based on rational analysis, or am I trying to attain a price that I am
anchored to, such as the purchase price or a high water mark?” and “Am I making
this forecast based on previously observed quantities or based on future expected
conditions?”
    It is important to remember that a company’s revenues and earnings for a given
period reflect conditions in that period. If the conditions in the future differ from the
past, revenues and earnings will likely differ as well, sometimes radically. Similarly,
security prices reflect investors’ perception of the future at a given point in time; a
given investor’s cost basis, past market levels, and other conditions based in the past
are often irrelevant. FMPs should look at the basis for any investment recommenda-
tion to see whether it is anchored to previous estimates or some “default” number.

Mental Accounting Bias
Mental accounting bias refers to mentally dividing money into “accounts” that
influence decisions, even though money is fungible (Thaler 1980). Despite traditional
finance theory assuming that FMPs consider their entire portfolio holistically in a
risk–return context, Statman (1999, 2008) contends that the difficulty individuals
have in addressing the interaction of different investments leads to mental accounting:
Investors construct portfolios in a layered pyramid format, with each layer addressing
a specific financial goal.

EXAMPLE 6

   Mental Accounting Bias
   Kendra Liu, an individual investor, owns shares in New Horizons Ltd., a pharma-
   ceutical company. A drug in that company’s research and development pipeline
   unexpectedly succeeds in a clinical trial, resulting in the shares doubling over-
   night. Liu sells half of her position in New Horizons and uses the proceeds to
   purchase shares of Cutting Edge Ltd., a small-cap biotechnology company. Liu
   believes that an investment in Cutting Edge is a “high-risk, high-reward bet”
   that could result in a total loss, but she is comfortable making the investment
   because she is using the proceeds from the sale of New Horizons Ltd., money
   that she did not expect to have anyway.
       Liu’s investment in Cutting Edge exhibits mental accounting bias. She has
   sorted the gains from New Horizons into a mental account based on its source,
   even though the money is fungible. Liu should invest the proceeds in a manner
   consistent with a holistic portfolio strategy.


Consequences of Mental Accounting Bias
As a result of mental accounting bias, FMPs may do the following:
    ■   Neglect opportunities to reduce risk by combining assets with low correla-
        tions. Offsetting positions across various portfolio layers or mental accounts
        can lead to suboptimal aggregate performance.

                              ■   Irrationally distinguish between returns derived from income and those
                                  derived from capital appreciation. Although many investors feel the need to
                                  preserve principal, they focus on the idea of spending income that the prin-
                                  cipal generates. As a result, many FMPs chase income streams, unwittingly
                                  risking principal in the process.
                              ■   Irrationally bifurcate wealth or a portfolio into investment principal and
                                  investment returns. Some FMPs may believe that greater risk can be taken
                                  with returns (from either income or capital appreciation) than the princi-
                                  pal initially contributed. A common euphemism for this scenario, from the
                                  casino world, is “playing with house money.”

                          Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Mental Accounting Bias
                          An effective way to detect and overcome mental accounting behavior is to recognize
                          its drawbacks. The primary drawback is that correlations between investments are not
                          considered, leading to unintentional risk taking. FMPs should go through the exercise
                          of combining all of their assets onto one spreadsheet (without headings or account
                          labels) to see the holistic asset allocation. This exercise often produces information
                          that is surprising when seen as a whole, such as higher cash balances than expected.
                          The logical next step would be to create a portfolio strategy taking all assets into
                          consideration.

                          Framing Bias
                          Framing bias is an information-processing bias in which a person answers a question
                          differently based on the way in which it is asked or framed. It is often possible to frame
                          a given decision problem in more than one way.
                              For example, a situation may be presented within a gain context (one in four
                          start-up companies succeed) or within a loss context (three out of four start-ups fail).
                          Given the first frame, an FMP may adopt a positive outlook and make venture capital
                          investments. Given the second frame, the FMP might not.
                              Narrow framing occurs when people evaluate information based on a narrow
                          frame of reference—that is, losing sight of the big picture in favor of one or two spe-
                          cific points. For example, an investor might focus solely on a company’s executive
                          management team, overlooking or even dismissing other important properties such
                          as industry characteristics, fundamental performance, and valuation.

                           EXAMPLE 7

                             Effects of Framing Bias
                             Decision-making frames are quite prevalent in the context of investor behavior.
                             Risk tolerance questionnaires can demonstrate how framing bias may occur in
                             practice and how FMPs should be aware of its effects.
                                 Suppose an investor is to take a risk tolerance questionnaire for the purpose
                             of determining which “risk category” she is in. The risk category will determine
                             asset allocations and the appropriate types of investments. The following infor-
                             mation is provided to each questionnaire taker:
                             Over a 10-year period, Portfolio ABC has averaged an annual return of 10%
                             with an annual standard deviation of 16%. Assuming a normal return distribu-
                             tion, in a given year there is a 67% probability that the return will fall within
                             one standard deviation of the mean, a 95% probability that the return will fall
                             within two standard deviations of the mean, and a 99.7% probability that the
                             return will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. Thus, there is a

Cognitive Errors                                                                             215


   67% chance that the return earned by Portfolio ABC will be between −6% and
   26%, a 95% chance that the return will be between −22% and 42%, and a 99.7%
   chance that the return will be between −38% and 58%.
      The following two questions focus on hypothetical Portfolio ABC, DEF, and
   XYZ. The risk and return for each portfolio are the same in each of the two
   questions, but the presentation of information differs.

        1. Based on the following chart, which investment portfolio fits your risk
           tolerance and desire for long-term return?
                                               ​




    Portfolio         95% Probability Return Range        10-Year Average Return

    XYZ                        0.5% to 6.5%                            3.5%
    DEF                      −18.0% to 30.0%                           6.0%
    ABC                      −22.0% to 42.0%                       10.0%
                                               ​




        2. Based on the following chart, which investment portfolio fits your risk
           tolerance and desire for long-term return?
                                               ​




    Portfolio        10-Year Average Return        Standard Deviation of Returns

    XYZ                        3.5%                             1.5%
    DEF                        6.0%                            12.0%
    ABC                       10.0%                            16.0%
                                               ​




        An investor may choose different portfolios when asked Question 1 com-
        pared with Question 2. Portfolio XYZ may appear more attractive in the first
        question, which uses two standard deviations to define the range of returns
        and show the risk, than in the second, which shows only the standard
        deviations. Also, in the second question, the returns are presented first and
        the measure of risk second. Thus, how questions are framed and the order
        in which they are presented can significantly affect how they are answered.
        FMPs should be acutely aware of how framing can affect investment choices.


Consequences of Framing Bias
As a result of framing bias, FMPs may do the following:
    ■    Misidentify risk tolerances because of how questions about risk tolerance
         were framed, becoming more risk-averse when presented with a gain frame
         of reference and more risk-seeking when presented with a loss frame of
         reference. This misidentification may result in suboptimal portfolios.
    ■    Focus on short-term price fluctuations, which may result in long-run con-
         siderations being ignored in the decision-making process.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Framing Bias
Framing bias is detected by asking such questions as, “Is the decision the result of
focusing on a net gain or net loss position?” As discussed earlier, an investor who has
framed the decision as a potential net loss is more likely to select a riskier investment;
if the decision is framed as a potential net gain, however, the investor is more likely
to go with a less risky investment. When making decisions, FMPs should try to elim-
inate any reference to gains and losses already incurred. Instead, they should focus
on the future prospects of an investment and try to be as neutral and open-minded
as possible when interpreting investment-related situations.

                          Availability Bias
                          Availability bias is an information-processing bias in which people estimate the prob-
                          ability of an outcome or the importance of a phenomenon based on how easily infor-
                          mation is recalled. Various sources of availability bias exist; the four most applicable
                          to FMPs are retrievability, categorization, narrow range of experience, and resonance.
                              Retrievability: If an answer or idea comes to mind more quickly than another
                          answer or idea, the first answer or idea will likely be chosen as correct even if it is
                          not the reality.
                              Categorization: When solving problems, people gather information from what
                          they perceive as relevant search sets. Different problems require different search sets,
                          which are often based on familiar categorizations. If it is difficult to come up with a
                          search set, because the object of the search is difficult to characterize, the estimated
                          probability of an event may be biased.
                              Narrow Range of Experience: When making an estimate, a person may use only a
                          narrow range of experience instead of considering multiple perspectives. For example,
                          assuming a product or service that has launched successfully in one country will be
                          globally successful.
                              Resonance: People are often biased by how closely a situation parallels their own
                          personal situation.

                           EXAMPLE 8

                             Availability Bias
                             A portfolio manager asks an analyst to research and present a list of companies
                             that have “strong growth potential.” The manager suggests looking for companies
                             that sell a product or service different from its competitors—but with a compelling
                             value proposition for customers—and that have a small share of a large market.
                                 The analyst is familiar with technology companies, software in particular,
                             based on prior work experience. The analyst has also seen a lot of news articles
                             covering various software companies that, he believes, fit the criteria. The analyst
                             begins screening among technology companies that have high revenue growth
                             rates for the last two quarters. Although the analyst is aware that other companies
                             in other sectors probably fit the criteria as well, the criteria are qualitative and
                             vague such that they cannot be easily translated as screening input.
                                 The analyst’s behavior exhibits availability bias from by considering only
                             technology companies in the search because he is familiar with them. The ana-
                             lyst should consult colleagues and/or external resources to widen his search
                             to include all sectors and for help with creatively specifying screening criteria.


                          Consequences of Availability Bias
                          As a result of availability bias, FMPs may do the following:
                              ■   Limit their investment opportunity set. This limitation may result because
                                  they use familiar classification schemes. They may restrict investments to
                                  stocks or bonds, securities of one country or one sector, and so on.
                              ■   Choose an investment, investment adviser, or mutual fund based on adver-
                                  tising or the quantity of news coverage. For instance, when asked to name
                                  potential mutual fund companies to invest with, many people will name only
                                  the funds that do extensive advertising. The choice of mutual fund should
                                  be based on a variety of factors that make it a good fit given the investor’s
                                  objectives and risk–return profile.

    ■   Fail to diversify. This failure may occur because they make their choices
        based on a narrow range of experience. For example, an investor who works
        for a company in a particular industry may overweight investments in that
        industry.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Availability Bias
To overcome availability bias, investors need to develop an appropriate investment
policy strategy, carefully research and analyze investment decisions before making
them, and focus on long-term historical data. Questions such as, “How did you decide
which investments to consider? Did you choose investments based on your familiarity
with the industry or country? Did you see them in an article or research report?” and
“Did you choose your investments because you like the companies’ products?” can
help identify issues of categorization, narrow range of experience, and resonance as
sources of availability bias. Availability bias may cause FMPs to think that events that
receive heavy media attention are more important than they actually are.

EXAMPLE 9

   The following information relates to Questions 1–5
       Luca Gerber recently became the chief investment officer for the Ludwigs
   Family Charity, a mid-size private foundation in Switzerland. Prior to assuming
   this role, Gerber was a well-known health care industry analyst. The Ludwigs’s
   family fortune is primarily the result of entrepreneurship. Gerhard Ludwigs
   founded ABC Innovations (ABC), a biotech company dedicated to small cell
   lung cancer research. The foundation’s portfolio is 15% invested in ABC.
       Gerber initially feels that the 15% investment in ABC is high. Upon review,
   however, he decides it is appropriate based on the Ludwigs’s involvement and
   their past success with similar ventures. Gerber makes a mental note to closely
   monitor the investment in ABC because he is unfamiliar with small-cap start-up
   companies. The remaining 85% of the foundation’s portfolio is invested in equity
   of high-quality large-cap pharmaceutical companies. Gerber deems this allocation
   appropriate and is excited that he can continue to use his superior knowledge
   of the health care industry.
       For the past two years, ABC has been dedicated to Project M, an effort
   directed at developing a drug to treat relapses in small cell lung cancer. Project
   M has delayed its Phase Two trials twice. Published results from Phase One trials
   have raised some concerns regarding the drug. In its last two quarterly investors’
   conference calls, ABC’s CEO was very cautious in discussing expectations for
   Project M. ABC’s stock price decreased by more than 20% during the past six
   months. Gerber believes that the research setbacks are temporary because of
   ABC’s past success with projects. He expects that ABC will begin Phase Two
   within a year, and he also believes that once Project M goes into Phase Two,
   ABC’s stock price should reach a new 52-week high of CHF80.
       Soon after deciding to hold the stock, Gerber reads an article by ABC’s chief
   scientist that details certain scientific results from Project M. As a conclusion,
   the article states: “Although we still have some major obstacles to overcome,
   the Project M team has seen positive signs that a treatment for small cell lung
   cancer is achievable.” Although Gerber has difficulty interpreting the scientific

218   Learning Module 5                                                    The Behavioral Biases of Individuals


                                 Today, ABC announces the news that it will no longer pursue Project M,
                             citing early signs of the project’s failure. In response to the announcement, the
                             stock price drops by 50%. Gerber is stunned. He reviews the company’s history
                             and notes that ABC had made numerous comments on its struggles to solve
                             Project M issues, which make the failure seem predictable at the time.

                             1. Gerber’s assessment of the foundation’s 100% allocation to biotechnology
                                and pharmaceutical companies is most likely an example of which bias?
                                 A. Framing
                                 B. Availability
                                 C. Hindsight
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. A consequence of availability bias is a limited investment op-
                                portunity set, based on the narrow range of experience of the FMP. Gerber’s
                                prior experience has likely resulted in perceiving a portfolio concentrated in
                                a single sector as appropriate because that sector reflects what he knows.

                             2. Gerber’s belief that the research setbacks were merely temporary given
                                ABC’s success with past projects is most likely an example of which bias?
                                 A. Availability
                                 B. Mental accounting
                                 C. Conservatism
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Conservatism bias can result in FMPs maintaining or only
                                slowly updating their views when presented with new information, especial-
                                ly when the information is complex. Faced with complex information in the
                                form of clinical trial delays that should have reduced his assessment of Proj-
                                ect M’s probability of success, Gerber elected to maintain his original views.

                             3. Researching the biotechnology industry average probability of success of
                                Phase 2 trials, particularly those that have experienced delays, is a strategy
                                that Gerber could have used to most likely mitigate which behavioral bias?
                                 A. Hindsight
                                 B. Representativeness
                                 C. Framing
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. A form of representativeness bias is base-rate neglect, in which
                                general information, such as the rate of incidence of a phenomenon for its
                                “reference class” of phenomena, is ignored in favor of individual, specific
                                information. Gerber did not consider the “base rate” of the success of Phase
                                2 trials.

                             4. Gerber’s approach to reading the article by ABC’s chief scientist could best
                                be described by exhibiting which behavioral bias?
                                 A. Representativeness

       C. Mental accounting
      Solution:
      B is correct. Confirmation bias refers to the tendency to seek confirming in-
      formation and ignore contradictory information. Gerber did not adequately
      interpret the scientific results or the broader message of the article, choos-
      ing instead to focus on the reassuring concluding message that confirmed
      his existing beliefs.

   5. Gerber’s conclusion, upon re-examining ABC’s history, is most likely an
      example of which behavioral bias?
      A. Confirmation
      B. Hindsight
       C. Conservatism
      Solution:
      B is correct. Hindsight bias is the result of selectively interpreting the past
      using knowledge of the present. Although Gerber should have implemented
      various mitigation strategies over the life of the investment, it is also true
      that investing, especially investing in a small-cap biotechnology company,
      is a probabilistic activity. Had Project M succeeded, Gerber may have been
      tempted to see the investment as evidence of his investment acumen, which
      would also be biased. The most useful examination of the past for Gerber
      would be investigating whether any mitigating actions or strategies would
      have been useful and putting them in place for subsequent investments.




EMOTIONAL BIASES
                                                                                            4
              discuss commonly recognized behavioral biases and their
              implications for financial decision making

We will now review six emotional biases, their implications for investment decision
making, and suggestions for managing the effects of these biases. Emotional biases
are harder to correct than cognitive errors because they originate from impulse or
intuition rather than conscious calculations. It is often possible only to recognize the
bias and adapt to it. The six emotional biases discussed are loss aversion, overconfi-
dence, self-control, status quo, endowment, and regret aversion.


Loss-Aversion Bias
Loss-aversion bias refers to the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to achieving
gains. Rational FMPs should accept more risk to increase gains, not to mitigate losses.
Paradoxically, in real life, FMPs instead tend to accept more risk to avoid losses than
to achieve gains. Loss aversion leads FMPs to hold their losers to avoid recognizing
losses and sell their winners to lock in profits.
    Kahneman and Tversky (1979) describe loss-averse investor behavior as the eval-
uation of gains and losses based on a reference point. A utility function that passes
through this reference point appears in Exhibit 1. It is S-shaped and asymmetric,
implying a greater impact of losses than of gains on utility for the same variation in
absolute value. This utility function implies risk-seeking behavior in the domain of
                          © CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.

                          losses (below the horizontal axis) and risk avoidance in the domain of gains (above
                          the horizontal axis). An important concept embedded in this utility representation
                          is what has been termed the disposition effect: the holding of investments that have
                          experienced losses too long, and the selling of investments that have experienced gains
                          too quickly (i.e., holding on to losers and selling winners). The resulting portfolio may
                          be riskier than the optimal portfolio based on the investor’s risk–return objectives.

                             Effects of Loss-Aversion Bias
                             Loss-aversion bias, executed in practice as the disposition effect, is observed
                             often by wealth management practitioners. The classic case of this bias is when
                             an investor opens her monthly account statement and scans the individual
                             investments for winners and losers. Seeing that some investments have lost
                             money and others have gained, the investor is likely to respond by continuing
                             to hold the losing investments. The idea of actually losing money is so painful
                             that the first reaction is to hold the investment until it breaks even.
                                  The investor is acting based on emotions, not cognitive reasoning. In this
                             case, if she did some research, the investor might learn that the company in
                             question is experiencing difficulty and that holding the investment actually adds
                             to the risk in the portfolio (hence the term risk-seeking in the domain of losses).
                                  Conversely, the winners are making money. Loss-averse FMPs tend to sell
                             these investments and realize their gains to avoid seeing gains evaporate. In
                             this case, if the investor did some research, she might learn that the company
                             in question actually improves the portfolio’s risk–return profile. By selling the
                             investment, not only is the potential for future losses eliminated but the poten-
                             tial for future gains is also eliminated. Combining the added risk of holding the
                             losers with the elimination of potential gains from selling the winners may make
                             investors’ portfolios less efficient than portfolios based on fundamental analysis.

Consequences of Loss Aversion
As a result of loss-aversion bias, FMPs may do the following:
   ■   Hold investments in a loss position longer than justified by fundamental
       analysis, in the hope that they will return to breakeven.
   ■   Sell investments in a gain position earlier than justified by fundamental
       analysis, out of fear that the gains will erode.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Loss Aversion
A disciplined approach to investment is a good way to alleviate the impact of the
loss-aversion bias. It is impossible to make experiencing losses any less painful emo-
tionally, but analyzing investments and realistically considering the probabilities of
future losses and gains may help guide the FMP to a rational decision.


Overconfidence Bias
Overconfidence bias is a bias in which people demonstrate unwarranted faith in their
own abilities. Overconfidence may be intensified when combined with self-attribution
bias, in which people take too much credit for successes (self-enhancing) and assign
responsibility to others for failures (self-protecting). Overconfidence has aspects of
both cognitive and emotional errors but is classified as emotional because the bias
primarily results from emotion.
    Overconfidence bias has two forms: prediction overconfidence and certainty over-
confidence. Both types demonstrate faulty reasoning combined with “gut feel” and hope.
Prediction overconfidence occurs when the confidence intervals that FMPs assign to
their investment predictions are too narrow. For example, when estimating the future
value of a stock, overconfident FMPs will incorporate far too little variation—using a
narrower range of expected payoffs and a lower standard deviation of returns—than
justified by historical results and fundamental analysis.
    Certainty overconfidence occurs when the probabilities that FMPs assign to
outcomes are too high. This certainty is often an emotional response rather than a
cognitive evaluation.

EXAMPLE 11

  Overconfidence Bias
  An analyst estimates that the price of oil will increase by 40% over the next 12
  months because prevailing prices are lower than many oil producers’ cost of
  production. Unprofitable producers reducing production will eventually put
  upward pressure on prices so long as oil demand remains stable or increases.
  Based on this forecast, the analyst recommends several high-yield bonds of oil
  producers to a portfolio manager.
      The portfolio manager asks the analyst for an estimate of downside risk: “How
  much could we lose if, say, the oil price falls another 10%?” The analyst replies,
  “That is unrealistic. The current oil price is as low as it can go, and yields on
  these bonds are as attractive as they will ever be. We must make the investment
  now. There is no credible downside case.”
      The analyst is exhibiting overconfidence bias by placing excessive certainty
  in his prediction and not considering the likelihood or impact of variance from
  that prediction.

                          Consequences of Overconfidence Bias
                          As a result of overconfidence bias, FMPs may do the following:
                              ■   Underestimate risks and overestimate expected returns.
                              ■   Hold poorly diversified portfolios, which may result in significant downside
                                  risk.

                          Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Overconfidence Bias
                          FMPs should review their trading records, identify both the winners and losers, and
                          calculate portfolio performance over at least two years. Investors with an unfounded
                          belief in their own ability to identify good investments may recall winners and their
                          results but underestimate the number and results of their losers. This review will
                          also identify the amount of trading. Overconfidence is also a cognitive error, and so
                          more-complete information can often help FMPs understand the error of their ways.
                              It is critical that investors be objective when making and evaluating investment
                          decisions. As an old Wall Street adage states, “Don’t confuse brains with a bull mar-
                          ket.” It is advisable to view the reasoning behind and the results of investments, both
                          winners and losers, as objectively as possible. When did you make money? When did
                          you lose money? Mentally separate your good money-making decisions from your
                          bad ones. Then, review the beneficial decisions and try to discern what, exactly, you
                          did correctly. Did you purchase an investment at a particularly advantageous time
                          based on fundamentals, or did you luck out by timing a market upswing? Similarly,
                          review the decisions that you categorized as poor. Did you invest aptly based on
                          fundamentals and then make an error when it came time to sell, or was the market
                          going through a correction?
                              When reviewing unprofitable decisions, look for patterns or common mistakes
                          that perhaps you were unaware you were making. Note any such tendencies that you
                          discover, and try to remain mindful of them by brainstorming a rule or reminder such
                          as: “I will do X in the future” or “I will not do Y in the future.”


                          Self-Control Bias
                          Self-control bias is a bias in which people fail to act in pursuit of their long-term,
                          overarching goals in favor of short-term satisfaction. For example, individuals pur-
                          suing the CFA charter may fail to study sufficiently because of short-term competing
                          demands on their time. Rational behavior suggests that people would do whatever is
                          necessary to achieve their long-term goals, but it often does not happen.
                              When it comes to money, many people are willing and able to save for the future,
                          but they often have difficulty sacrificing present consumption because of a lack of
                          self-control. This apparent lack of self-control may also be a function of hyperbolic
                          discounting, the human tendency to prefer small payoffs now compared with larger
                          payoffs in the future. Sacrifices in the present require much greater payoffs in the
                          future; otherwise, people will be unwilling to make current sacrifices.



                          Consequences of Self-Control Bias
                          As a result of self-control bias, FMPs may do the following:
                              ■   Save insufficiently for the future, which may, in turn, result in accepting too
                                  much risk in portfolios in an attempt to generate higher returns.
                              ■   Borrow excessively to finance present consumption.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Self-Control Bias
FMPs should ensure that a proper investment plan is in place and should have a
personal budget. Plans need to be in writing, so that they can be reviewed regularly.
Similarly, FMPs should look to maintain a strategic asset allocation based on a thor-
ough evaluation.


Status Quo Bias
Status quo bias is an emotional bias in which people choose to do nothing (i.e.,
maintain the “status quo”) instead of making a change, even when change is warranted.
Status quo bias is often discussed in tandem with endowment and regret-aversion
biases because an outcome of the biases, maintaining existing positions, is similar. The
reasons for maintaining the existing positions differ, however. In the status quo bias,
positions are maintained largely because of inertia rather than conscious choice. In
endowment and regret-aversion biases, positions are maintained because of conscious,
but possibly incorrect, choices.

EXAMPLE 12

  The Path of Least Resistance
  Using data from three firms, Choi et al. (2001) studied the impact of automati-
  cally enrolling employees in a defined contribution pension plan and how default
  contribution rates and investment options affect participants’ behavior.
      Automatic enrollment increased employee participation in the defined
  contribution plan from 26%–43% after six months’ tenure and 57%–69% after
  three years’ tenure to >85% for both tenures at all three firms.
      Although automatic enrollment increased participation, more than 65% of
  employees tended to contribute the employer-specified default amount—2% or
  3%—and remained in the default investment option. Although this percentage
  declined slowly over time, even after two years of tenure, more than 40% of
  participants continued to use the default.




Consequences of Status Quo Bias
As a result of status quo bias, FMPs may do the following:
   ■   Unknowingly maintain portfolios with risk characteristics that are inappro-
       priate for their circumstances.
   ■   Fail to explore other opportunities.

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Status Quo Bias
Status quo bias may be exceptionally strong and difficult to overcome. Education is
essential. FMPs should quantify the risk-reducing and return-enhancing advantages
of diversification and proper asset allocation. For example, with a concentrated stock
position, showing what can happen to overall wealth levels if the stock collapses may
persuade an FMP to diversify.

224   Learning Module 5                                                    The Behavioral Biases of Individuals



                          Endowment Bias
                          Endowment bias is an emotional bias in which people value an asset more when
                          they own it than when they do not. Endowment bias is inconsistent with standard
                          economic theory, which asserts that the price a person is willing to pay for a good
                          should equal the price at which that person would be willing to sell the same good.
                          Psychologists have found, however, that people tend to state minimum selling prices
                          for a good that exceed maximum purchase prices that they are willing to pay for the
                          same good. Effectively, ownership “endows” the asset with added value.
                              Endowment bias may be the result of several other behavioral biases, such as loss
                          aversion, anchoring and adjustment, and overconfidence. Despite the name, purchased
                          as well as inherited securities can be subject to endowment bias.

                           EXAMPLE 13

                             Endowment Bias
                             Several of an investment analyst’s recommended stocks have done well for the
                             past five years, prompting the portfolio manager to ask for a brief update on
                             each, including valuations. For each stock, the analyst estimates that fair value is
                             at least another 40% above the current price. The portfolio manager challenges
                             the analyst by pointing out that the fair value estimates imply valuation multiples
                             that are at least two standard deviations above the five-year average and are well
                             above even the most bullish sell-side analyst’s target price. The analyst responds
                             by saying that the market is overlooking these companies’ fundamentals. The
                             portfolio manager then asks, “Would you buy these shares today?” The analyst
                             answers, “Probably not.”
                                 The analyst is likely exhibiting endowment bias by overestimating the value
                             of shares already owned in the portfolio. This bias is likely the result of having
                             successfully invested in the shares.




                          Consequences of Endowment Bias
                          Endowment bias may lead FMPs to do the following:
                              ■   Fail to sell certain assets and replace them with other assets.
                              ■   Continue to hold classes of assets with which they are familiar. FMPs may
                                  believe they understand the characteristics of the investments they already
                                  own and may be reluctant to purchase assets with which they have less
                                  experience. Familiarity adds to owners’ perceived value of a security.
                              ■   As a result, the FMP may maintain an inappropriate asset allocation. The
                                  portfolio may be inappropriate for investors’ levels of risk tolerance and
                                  financial goals.

                          Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Endowment Bias
                          Many wealth management practitioners have encountered clients who are reluctant to
                          sell securities bequeathed by previous generations. Often in these situations, investors
                          cite feelings of disloyalty associated with the prospect of selling inherited securities,
                          general uncertainty in determining the right choice, and concerns about tax issues.
                          An FMP should ask, “If an equivalent sum to the value of the investments inherited
                          had been received in cash, how would you invest the cash?” Often, the answer is into
                          a very different investment portfolio than the one inherited. It may also be useful to
                          explore the deceased’s intent in owning the investment and bequeathing it. “Was the

Emotional Biases                                                                            225


primary intent to leave the specific investment portfolio because it was perceived to
be a suitable investment based on fundamental analysis, or was it to leave financial
resources to benefit the heirs?” Heirs who affirm the latter conclusion are receptive
to considering alternative asset allocations.
     An effective way to address endowment bias for purchased securities, when an
estimated “sell price” is far higher than any reasonable FMP’s estimate of a “buy price”
is to ask, “Would you buy this security today at the current price?” A similar question
is, “Why are you not buying more of this security today?” Answering these questions
can turn the focus away from the past to the present, toward considering the upside
from the current price.


Regret-Aversion Bias
Regret-aversion bias is an emotional bias in which people tend to avoid making
decisions out of fear that the decision will turn out poorly. Regret-aversion bias has
two dimensions: actions that people take and actions that people could have taken.
Regret is more intense when the unfavorable outcomes are the result of an action taken
versus the result of an action not taken. Thus, no action becomes the default decision.



Consequences of Regret-Aversion Bias
As a result of regret-aversion bias, FMPs may do the following:
   ■   Be too conservative in their investment choices as a result of poor outcomes
       on risky investments in the past. FMPs may wish to avoid the regret of mak-
       ing another bad investment and decide that low-risk instruments are better.
       This behavior can lead to long-term underperformance and failure to reach
       investment goals.
   ■   Engage in herding behavior. FMPs may feel safer in popular investments in
       order to limit potential future regret. It seems safe to be with the crowd,
       and a reduction in potential emotional pain is perceived. Regret aversion
       may lead to preference for stocks of well-known companies even in the face
       of equal risk and return expectations. Choosing the stocks of less-familiar
       companies is perceived as riskier and involves more personal responsibility
       and greater potential for regret. As John Maynard Keynes (1936) wrote,
       “Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail convention-
       ally than to succeed unconventionally.”

Detection of and Guidelines for Overcoming Regret-Aversion Bias
FMPs should quantify the risk-reducing and return-enhancing advantages of diversi-
fication and proper asset allocation. Regret aversion can cause some FMPs to invest
too conservatively or too riskily depending on the current trends. With proper diver-
sification, FMPs will accept the appropriate level of risk in their portfolios depending,
of course, on return objectives. To prevent investments from being too conservative,
FMPs must recognize that losses happen to everyone and keep in mind the long-term
benefits of including risky assets in portfolios. Recognizing that bubbles happen and
keeping in mind long-term objectives will prevent a client from making investments
that are too risky.

                           EXAMPLE 14

                             Tiffany Jordan is a hedge fund manager with a history of outstanding perfor-
                             mance. For the past 10 years, Jordan’s fund has used an equity market–neutral
                             strategy (a long–short strategy that strives to eliminate market risk—i.e., beta
                             should be zero), which has proved effective as a result of Jordan’s hard work. An
                             equity market–neutral strategy normally generates large daily trading volume
                             and shifts in individual security positions. Jordan’s reputation has grown over
                             the years as her fund has consistently beaten its benchmark. Employee turnover
                             on her team has been high; Jordan tends to be quick to blame and rarely gives
                             credit to team members for success. During the past 12 months, her fund has
                             been significantly underperforming its benchmark.
                                 One of Jordan’s junior analysts, Jeremy Tang, is concerned about the under-
                             performance and notes the following:
                                 Observation 1: Certain positions are significantly underwater, have very high
                             risk profiles, and have been held for much longer than normal.
                                 Observation 2: The fund’s trading volume has decreased by more than 40%
                             during the past year.
                                 Observation 3: The portfolio is more concentrated in a few sectors than in
                             the past.
                                 Worried that the portfolio may be in violation of the fund’s investment policy
                             statement (IPS), Tang brings this concern to Jordan’s attention during a regular
                             weekly team meeting. Jordan dismisses Tang’s analysis and tells the team not
                             to worry because she knows what she is doing. Jordan indicates that because
                             she believes the pricing misalignment will correct itself, the portfolio would be
                             unable to take advantage of the reversion to the mean if she were to sell certain
                             losing positions. She reassures the team that this strategy has performed well
                             in the past and that the markets will revert, bringing the fund’s returns back to
                             normal levels.
                                 Tang tactfully suggests that the team review the fund’s IPS together, and
                             Jordan interrupts him and reminds the team that she has memorized the IPS by
                             heart. Tang contemplates his next step. He is concerned that Jordan is displaying
                             behavioral biases that are affecting the fund’s performance.

                             1. By taking credit for successes but assigning blame for failures, Jordan is most
                                likely demonstrating:
                                 A. loss-aversion bias.
                                 B. self-attribution bias.
                                 C. illusion of control bias.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. In self-attribution bias, people take credit for successes and as-
                                sign responsibilities for failure. Jordan claims successful decisions for herself
                                while attributing poor decisions to the team. Her self-esteem affects how
                                she looks at success and failure. Self-attribution and illusion of knowledge
                                biases contribute to overconfidence bias, which Jordan clearly demonstrates
                                later when she tells the team that she knows what she is doing.

                             2. Which of Tang’s observations is least likely to be the consequence of Jordan
                                demonstrating loss-aversion bias?
                                 A. Observation 1
                                 B. Observation 2

Emotional Biases                                                                       227


      C. Observation 3
     Solution:
     C is correct. Loss aversion by itself may cause a sector concentration; how-
     ever, a market-neutral strategy tends to focus on individual stocks without
     regard to sector. The sector exposure would be mitigated with the balancing
     of the individual long and short positions.

  3. Which of Jordan’s actions least supports that she may be affected by the
     illusion of control bias?
      A. Her dismissal of Tang’s analysis
      B. Her routine of holding weekly team meetings
      C. Her comment on market turnaround and current holdings
     Solution:
     B is correct. Holding weekly team meetings, which indicates a willingness
     to listen to feedback from others, is not representative of the illusion of
     control bias. In the illusion of control bias, people believe they can control
     outcomes to a greater extent than is possible. Individuals exhibiting this bias
     display great certainty in their predictions of outcomes of chance events and
     ignore others’ viewpoints. Jordan is sure that the market will turn around
     even though it is out of her control. She chooses not to listen to Tang, who is
     questioning her viewpoint.

  4. How does Jordan most likely demonstrate loss-aversion bias?
      A. Telling the team not to worry
      B. Reducing the portfolio turnover this year
      C. Deciding to hold the losing positions until they turn around
     Solution:
     C is correct. Jordan’s behavior is a classic example of loss aversion: When a
     loss occurs, she holds on to these positions longer than warranted. By doing
     so, Jordan has accepted more risk in the portfolio. In loss-aversion bias, peo-
     ple exhibit a strong preference to avoid losses versus achieving gains. One
     of the consequences of loss aversion bias is that the financial management
     professional (in this case, Jordan) may hold losing investments in the hope
     that they will return to breakeven or better.

  5. Which of the following emotional biases has Jordan most likely exhibited?
      A. Endowment
      B. Regret aversion
      C. Overconfidence
     Solution:
     C is correct. Jordan exhibits overconfidence in several ways. She ignores the
     analysis done by Tang. This may be because Jordan believes she is smarter
     and more informed than her team members, which is typical of an individ-
     ual with an illusion of knowledge bias. The certainty she demonstrates that
     the market will revert is evidence of overconfidence. Her overconfidence is
     intensified by her self-attribution bias, which is demonstrated through her
     dealings with her team when she blames them for losses while taking credit
     for gains. Finally, her portfolio’s underperformance against the benchmark is
     a consequence of overconfidence bias.

                             6. Which of the following biases did Jordan not demonstrate?
                                 A. Self-attribution
                                 B. Representativeness
                                 C. Illusion of knowledge
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Nowhere in the scenario did it mention that Jordan classified
                                certain information into a personalized category. Representativeness bias
                                is a cognitive bias in which people tend to classify new information based
                                on past experiences and classifications. Jordan is not relating her certainty
                                about the future or her decision to hold losing positions back to anything
                                she has done or experienced in the past.

                             7. Which of Tang’s findings is not a typical consequence of self-control bias?
                                 A. Failure to explore other portfolio opportunities
                                 B. Asset allocation imbalance problems in the portfolio
                                 C. A higher risk profile in the portfolio resulting from pursuit of higher
                                    returns
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Failing to explore other opportunities is a demonstration of
                                status quo bias, not self-control. Self-control bias occurs when individuals
                                deviate from their long-term goals—in this case, the IPS—because of a lack
                                of self-discipline. Jordan is not adhering to the strategy that has succeeded
                                in the past. The consequences of self-control bias include accepting too
                                much risk in the portfolio (C) and asset allocation imbalance problems (B)
                                as Jordan attempts to generate higher returns.




              5           BEHAVIORAL FINANCE AND MARKET BEHAVIOR

                                        describe how behavioral biases of investors can lead to market
                                        characteristics that may not be explained by traditional finance

                          Some persistent market patterns run counter to market efficiency. This section focuses
                          on the contributions of behavioral finance to understanding these exceptions to mar-
                          ket efficiency, such as momentum, value, bubbles, and crashes, by explaining them as
                          functions of behavioral biases.


                          Defining Market Anomalies
                          Anomalies are apparent deviations from the efficient market hypothesis, identified
                          by persistent abnormal returns that differ from zero and are predictable in direction.
                          Not every deviation is anomalous. Misclassifications tend to stem from three sources:
                          choice of asset pricing model, statistical issues, and temporary disequilibria.
                              Classifying returns as “abnormal” presupposes a definition of “normal returns,”
                          which generally depends on the asset pricing model used. If a reasonable change in
                          the method of estimating normal returns causes an anomaly to disappear, then it is
                          reasonable to suggest that the anomaly is an illusion. Fama (1998) includes in this

puzzle”) and the positive abnormal returns apparent in the 12 months after a stock
split. Similarly, when high returns persist on a particular class of securities, or rela-
tive to a specific factor in valuation, it might simply be compensation for excess risk
rather than an anomaly.
    Other apparent anomalies may be explained by the small samples involved, a
statistical bias in selection or survivorship, or data mining that overanalyzes data for
patterns and treats spurious correlations as relevant. The magnitude of any over- or
underperformance also depends critically on the choice of benchmark, which can
make it hard to interpret results.
    Finally, from time to time, markets can present temporary disequilibrium behav-
ior, unusual features that may survive for a period of years but ultimately disappear.
Publication of the anomaly, which draws attention to the pattern, usually starts the
arbitrage that removes the behavior. For example, the small company January effect,
part of the turn-of-the-year effect, does not appear persistent once appropriate
adjustment for risk is made. The weekend effect, involving lower stock market returns
on Mondays, appears to have diminished in the United States and United Kingdom.
    The anomalies discussed in this section reflect behavior that has been identified
and analyzed in a number of markets around the world and during different periods.
The patterns have been documented in many academic studies, with broadly similar
conclusions. Behavioral finance can help provide good explanations by identifying
underlying behavioral biases.


Momentum
Studies have documented, in a range of markets globally, momentum or trending effects
in which future price behavior correlates with that of the recent past (Jegadeesh and
Titman 1993; Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton 2008). The positive correlation typically
lasts for up to two years before showing a reversal or reversion to the mean, evident
in two- to five-year return periods.

EXAMPLE 15

   The Momentum Effect: London Business School Study
   The study involves buying the top 20% of a performance-ranked list of stocks
   and selling short the bottom 20%. In the 52 years to 2007 in the UK market,
   the stocks that had outperformed the market most in the previous 12 months
   went on to generate an annualized return of 18.3%, whereas the market’s worst
   underperformers rose by 6.8% on average. During that period, the market as a
   whole rose by 13.5% a year. In a subsequent study using data from 2000 to 2007,
   the momentum effect was also evident in each of the 16 other international
   markets researched.
       The authors noted, “The momentum effect, both in the United Kingdom
   and globally, has been pervasive and persistent. Though costly to implement
   on a standalone basis, all investors need to be acutely aware of momentum.
   Even if they do not set out to exploit it, momentum is likely to be an important
   determinant of their investment performance.”
   Source: Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2008).

    Momentum can be partly explained by availability, hindsight, and loss aversion
biases.
    Studies have identified faulty learning models within traders, in which reasoning
is based on their recent experience. Behaviorally, this is availability bias. In this con-
text, availability bias is also called the recency effect, which is the tendency to recall

                          recent events more vividly and give them undue weight. In such models, if the price
                          of an asset rises for a period of time, investors may simply extrapolate this rise to the
                          future. Research points to a tendency for individual private investors to extrapolate
                          trends and to suffer more from recency bias, whereas many investment professionals
                          expect reversion to the mean.
                              Regret is the feeling that an opportunity has been missed and is typically an
                          expression of hindsight bias, which reflects the human tendency to see past events as
                          having been predictable. Regret can be particularly acute when the market is volatile
                          and investors feel they could have predicted the significant market moves, thereby
                          increasing profit or reducing loss. Faced with regret from not owning a mutual fund or
                          stock when it performed well in the previous year, investors may be driven emotionally
                          to remedy this regret. These behavioral factors can explain short-term year-on-year
                          trending and contribute to overtrading.


                          Bubbles and Crashes
                          Although bubbles and crashes have been documented for a long time (Mackay’s
                          Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds was published in 1841),
                          their existence presents a challenge to the concept of market efficiency. Historical
                          examples include the technology bubble of 1999–2000 and the residential property
                          boom of 2005–2007, evident in a range of economies globally including the United
                          States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Exhibit 2 illustrates the residential property
                          boom in the United Kingdom.

                          First, note that some bubbles may have rational explanations. Rational investors may
                          expect a future crash but not know its exact timing. For periods of time, there may not
                          be effective arbitrage because of the cost of selling short, unwillingness of investors to
                          bear extended losses, or simply unavailability of suitable instruments. These factors
                          were considerations in past technology and real estate bubbles. Investment managers
                          incentivized on, or accountable for, short-term performance may even rationalize their
                          participation in the bubble in terms of commercial or career risk.

    Investors’ behaviors and incentives during bubbles are illustrated in Exhibit 16.
The manager of Fund A believed he could exit a bubble profitably by selling near the
top. The manager of Fund B correctly avoided the bubble, but clients held the manager
accountable for short-run performance, which resulted in the fund’s closure.

EXAMPLE 16

   Investor Behavior in Bubbles
   Consider the differing behavior of two managers of major hedge funds during
   the technology stock bubble of 1998–2000:
       The manager of Hedge Fund A was asked why he did not get out of internet
   stocks earlier even though he knew by December 1999 that technology stocks
   were overvalued. He replied, “We thought it was the eighth inning, and it was the
   ninth. I did not think the NASDAQ composite would go down 33% in 15 days.”
   Faced with losses, and despite his previous strong 12-year record, he resigned
   as Hedge Fund A’s manager in April 2000.
       The manager of Hedge Fund B refused to invest in technology stocks in 1998
   and 1999 because he thought they were overvalued. After strong performance
   over 17 years, Hedge Fund B was dissolved in 2000 because its returns could
   not keep up with the returns generated by technology stocks.

    Behavioral finance does not yet provide a full explanation for bubbles and crashes,
but a number of specific cognitive biases and emotional biases prevalent during such
periods can be identified.
    In bubbles, investors often exhibit symptoms of overconfidence; overtrading,
underestimation of risks, failure to diversify, and rejection of contradictory informa-
tion. With overconfidence, investors are more active and trading volume increases,
thus lowering their expected profits. For overconfident investors (active traders),
studies have shown that returns are less than returns to either less active traders or
the market while risk is higher. At the market level, volatility also often increases in
a market with overconfident traders.
    The overconfidence and excessive trading that contribute to a bubble are linked to
confirmation bias and self-attribution bias. In a rising market, sales of stocks from a
portfolio will typically be profitable, even if winners are being sold too soon. Investors
can have faulty learning models that bias their understanding of this profit to take per-
sonal credit for success, a form of hindsight bias. Selling for a gain appears to validate
a good decision in an original purchase and may confer a sense of pride in locking in
the profit. This dynamic fuels overconfidence that can lead to poor decisions. Regret
aversion can also encourage investors to participate in a bubble, believing they are
“missing out” on profit opportunities as stocks appreciate.
    As a bubble unwinds, markets may underreact because of anchoring when investors
do not sufficiently update their beliefs. The early stages of unwinding a bubble can
involve investors in cognitive dissonance, who ignore losses and attempt to rationalize
flawed decisions. Eventually, investors capitulate, which accelerates price declines.


Value
Value stocks are typically characterized by low price-to-earnings ratios, high
book-to-market equity, and low price-to-dividend ratios. Growth stock characteristics
are generally the opposite of value stock characteristics. For example, growth stocks
are characterized by low book-to-market equity, high price-to-earnings ratios, and
high price-to-dividend ratios. A number of studies have identified outperformance

                          of value stocks relative to growth stocks over long periods. Fama and French (1998)
                          found that value stocks (high book-to-market equity) outperformed growth stocks
                          (low book-to-market equity) in 12 of 13 major markets during the 1975–1995 period.
                              Fama and French have also found, however, that the value stock anomaly disappears
                          in a three-factor asset pricing model. This result suggests that size and book-to-market
                          factors are not mispricing but instead represent compensation for risk exposures,
                          such as the greater potential of companies with these characteristics to suffer distress
                          during economic downturns.
                              A number of other studies have offered behavioral explanations for value anoma-
                          lies, presenting the anomalies as mispricing rather than compensation for increased
                          risk. These studies recognize the emotional factors involved in appraising stocks.
                          The halo effect, for example, extends a favorable evaluation of some characteristics
                          to other characteristics. A company with a good growth record and good previous
                          share price performance might be seen as a good investment, with higher expected
                          returns than its risk characteristics merit. This view is a form of representativeness
                          that can lead investors to extrapolate recent past performance into expected returns.
                          Overconfidence can also be involved in predicting growth rates, potentially leading
                          growth stocks to be overvalued.
                              Studies have also identified that emotions play a role in estimating risk and expected
                          return of stocks. The impact of emotional biases may be greater with less sophisticated
                          or retail investors, but it has also been identified as a bias in analysts and professional
                          investors. The emotional attraction of a stock can be enhanced by personal experience
                          of products, the value of the brand, marketing expenditures, and the proximity of the
                          headquarters to the analyst or investor. This last issue reflects the home bias anomaly,
                          by which portfolios exhibit a strong bias in favor of domestic securities in the context
                          of global portfolios. The effect has also been noted within geographical boundaries,
                          favoring companies headquartered nearer the investor. Home bias may reflect a per-
                          ceived relative informational advantage, a greater feeling of comfort with the access
                          to company executives that proximity brings (either personal or local brokerage), or
                          a psychological desire to invest in a local community.
                              To the extent to which less sophisticated investors are influenced by emotions,
                          they may value growth companies more highly. Stock returns of funds that are rated
                          as popular in a Fortune magazine survey are found to be subsequently low. A more
                          positive emotional rating in a company leads investors to perceive the company’s
                          stock as less risky. Although the capital asset pricing model assumes risk and expected
                          return are positively correlated, many investors behave as if the correlation is negative,
                          expecting higher returns with lower risk.




                             SUMMARY
                          Behavioral biases potentially affect the behaviors and decisions of financial market
                          participants. By understanding these biases, financial market participants may be able
                          to moderate or adapt to them and, as a result, improve upon economic outcomes.
                          Behavioral biases may be categorized as either cognitive errors or emotional biases.
                          The type of bias influences whether its impact may be moderated or adapted to.
                             Among the points made in this reading are the following:
                              ■   Individuals do not necessarily act rationally and consider all available infor-
                                  mation in the decision-making process because they may be influenced by
                                  behavioral biases.
                              ■   Biases may lead to suboptimal decisions.

   ■   Behavioral biases may be categorized as either cognitive errors or emotional
       biases. A single bias may have aspects of both, however, with one type of
       bias dominating.
   ■   Cognitive errors stem from basic statistical, information-processing, or
       memory errors; cognitive errors typically result from faulty reasoning.
   ■   Emotional biases stem from impulse or intuition and tend to result from
       reasoning influenced by feelings.
   ■   Cognitive errors are more easily corrected for because they stem from faulty
       reasoning rather than an emotional predisposition.
   ■   Emotional biases are harder to correct for because they are based on feel-
       ings, which can be difficult to change.
   ■   To adapt to a bias is to recognize and accept the bias and to adjust for the
       bias rather than to attempt to moderate the bias.
   ■   To moderate a bias is to recognize the bias and to attempt to reduce or even
       eliminate the bias within the individual.
   ■   Cognitive errors can be further classified into two categories: belief perse-
       verance biases and information-processing biases.
   ■   Belief perseverance errors reflect an inclination to maintain beliefs. The
       belief is maintained by committing statistical, information-processing, or
       memory errors. Belief perseverance biases are closely related to the psycho-
       logical concept of cognitive dissonance.
   ■   Belief perseverance biases include conservatism, confirmation, representa-
       tiveness, illusion of control, and hindsight.
   ■   Information-processing biases result in information being processed and
       used illogically or irrationally.
   ■   Information-processing biases include anchoring and adjustment, mental
       accounting, framing, and availability.
   ■   Emotional biases include loss aversion, overconfidence, self-control, status
       quo, endowment, and regret aversion.
   ■   Understanding and detecting biases is the first step in overcoming the effect
       of biases on financial decisions. By understanding behavioral biases, finan-
       cial market participants may be able to moderate or adapt to the biases and,
       as a result, improve upon economic outcomes.
   ■   Behavioral finance has the potential to explain some apparent deviations
       from market efficiency (market anomalies).

                          The following information relates to questions
                          7-10
                              Caitríona Daosri is a portfolio manager for an international bank, where she
                              advises high-net-worth clients. Daosri is meeting with a new client, Estêvão
                              Kai, a 40-year-old surgeon with €4 million across various accounts and a salary
                              of €500,000 per annum. Kai explains to Daosri that he has four accounts at four
                              different banks, each with specific sources and uses of funds, as shown in the
                              following table:

                          Bank Account                  Source of Deposits               Use of Funds

                          1                                   Salary                    Living expenses
                          2                                   Bonus                     Charitable gifts

                          7. Based on the description of how Kai manages his finances as outlined in Exhibit
                             1, Kai most likely exhibits the behavioral bias of:
                              A. endowment.

                              B. mental accounting.

                              C. framing.

                          8. Which of the following is a likely consequence of Kai’s approach to managing his
                             finances?
                              A. Concentrated portfolio positions

                              B. Forgone opportunities to reduce risk by combining assets with low
                                 correlations

                              C. Excessive trading

                          9. Which strategy should Daosri use or recommend to Kai?
                              A. Keep written records of investment decisions.

                              B. Ask questions such as, “Is the decision the result of focusing on a net gain or
                                 net loss position?”

                              C. Aggregate all accounts and portfolios into a single spreadsheet.

                          10. Which of the following individual behavioral biases is most strongly associated
                              with market bubbles?
                              A. Overconfidence

                              B. Representativeness

                              C. Framing

   B. Representativeness

   C. Regret aversion

12. All of the following are reasons that an apparent deviation from the efficient mar-

    versus growth stocks may not be anomalous except:
   A. Abnormal returns represent compensation for risk exposures, such as the
      heightened risk of value stocks to suffer distress during downturns.

   B. Companies with strong historical growth rates are viewed as good invest-
      ments, with higher expected returns than risk characteristics merit.

   C. The deviation disappears by incorporating a three-factor asset pricing
      model.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. A is correct. Under-diversified portfolios are a consequence of both illusion of
                             control and confirmation biases. Researchers have found that some investors
                             prefer to invest in companies that they feel they have control over, such as the
                             companies they work for, leading them to hold concentrated positions. Con-
                             firmation bias may lead to FMPs ignoring negative news, paying attention only
                             to information confirming that a company is a good investment, which may
                             result in large positions. Representativeness bias is not typically associated with
                             under-diversified portfolios.

                          2. C is correct. This advice is specifically aimed at reducing self-attribution bias,
                             a form of overconfidence bias. This bias may result in FMPs taking credit for
                             investment success, as well as assigning responsibility to others for investment
                             failures, when in reality the investment results reflect exogenous market forces.

                          3. C is correct. Both endowment bias and regret-aversion bias often result in inde-
                             cision or inertia—a typical outcome of status quo bias, in which people prefer to
                             not make changes even when changes are warranted.

                          4. C is correct. Endowment bias refers to people attributing additional, unwarrant-
                             ed value to things they possess versus things they do not. This bias is evident in
                             FMPs that systematically and materially overvalue securities in their portfolio
                             versus securities not in their portfolio. The question “Would you buy this security
                             today at the current price?” turns the investor’s attention to assessing the reason-
                             ableness of the current price as a buy price rather than solely as a selling price.

                          5. A is correct. Park is extrapolating his observation based on a narrow range of
                             experience (working at a hedge fund that employs many CFA charterholders) to
                             the entire population of CFA charterholders. Using a narrow range of experience
                             is a form of availability bias.

                          6. C is correct. Conservatism bias results in maintain or only slowly updating views
                             and forecasts despite the presence of new information. FMPs in the 1990s were
                             reluctant to update forecasts, despite materially different new information for
                             several years.

                          7. B is correct. Kai has segregated money into four different accounts based on the
                             sources and uses of his funds. Although intuitively appealing, this approach is ir-
                             rational because money is fungible across the four accounts. Nothing is stopping
                             Kai from collapsing them into a single “account” with a holistic portfolio strategy.

                          8. B is correct. The most common consequence of mental accounting is neglecting
                             opportunities to reduce risk by combining assets with low correlations, because
                             each account’s asset allocation is examined discretely. Offsetting positions across
                             accounts, or an overall inefficient allocation with respect to risk, can lead to sub-
                             optimal aggregate performance.

                          9. C is correct. Aggregating mental accounts is a logical strategy to combat mental
                             accounting. It is the opposite of disaggregating money into separate accounts.

                          10. A is correct. The overconfidence and excessive trading that contribute to a bubble
                              are linked to self-attribution bias, a form of overconfidence. In a rising market,
                              sales of stocks from a portfolio will typically be profitable, even if winners are
                              being sold too soon, and FMPs will attribute profits and strong performance to

Solutions                                                                                  239


   their investment acumen and subsequently underestimate risks.

11. B is correct. Representativeness refers to the tendency to adopt a view or forecast
    based on individual information or a small sample, as well to use simple classifi-
    cations. The halo effect is an example of representativeness, because FMPs extend
    an overall favorable evaluation to an investment (e.g., a “good company”) based
    on one or few characteristics (e.g., a “visionary CEO”).

12. C is correct. Bubbles and crashes are well-known and well-documented phenom-
    ena yet represent market anomalies.

13. B is correct. Investment managers’ incentives—or perhaps more accurately,
    their perception of their incentives—for short-term performance were named as
    considerations in the technology and real estate bubbles. Not participating in the
    bubble presented certain FMPs with commercial or career risk.

14. B is correct. Home bias refers to FMPs preferentially investing in domestic
    securities, likely reflecting perceived relative informational advantages, a greater
    feeling of comfort with the access to company executives that proximity brings
    (either personal or through a local brokerage), or a psychological desire to invest
    in a local community. Momentum, on the other hand, has been documented in
    a range of markets around the world, in a time-dependent manner, and reflects
    some FMPs’ availability bias, manifested as a belief that stocks will continue to
    rise because recently they have only risen, as well as regret aversion by those who
    invest in past winners because they regret not investing in them in the past.

15. B is correct. This choice describes the halo effect, which does offer a behavior-
    al explanation for the poor performance of growth stocks versus value stocks.
    Growth stocks are mispriced relative to their risk characteristics, because FMPs
    focusing on just a few properties, such as a high historical revenue growth rate,

INTRODUCTION
Risk—and risk management—is an inescapable part of economic activity. People
                                                                                            1
generally manage their affairs to be as happy and secure as their environment and
resources will allow. But regardless of how carefully these affairs are managed, there is
risk because the outcome, whether good or bad, is seldom predictable with complete
certainty. There is risk inherent in nearly everything we do, but this reading will focus
on economic and financial risk, particularly as it relates to investment management.
    All businesses and investors manage risk, whether consciously or not, in the
choices they make. At its core, business and investing are about allocating resources
and capital to chosen risks. In their decision process, within an environment of
uncertainty, these organizations may take steps to avoid some risks, pursue the risks
that provide the highest rewards, and measure and mitigate their exposure to these
risks as necessary. Risk management processes and tools make difficult business and
financial problems easier to address in an uncertain world. Risk is not just a matter
of fate; it is something that organizations can actively manage with their decisions,

                          within a risk management framework. Risk is an integral part of the business or
                          investment process. Even in the earliest models of modern portfolio theory, such as
                          mean–variance portfolio optimization and the capital asset pricing model, investment
                          return is linked directly to risk but requires that risk be managed optimally. Proper
                          identification and measurement of risk, and keeping risks aligned with the goals of
                          the enterprise, are key factors in managing businesses and investments. Good risk
                          management results in a higher chance of a preferred outcome—more value for the
                          company or portfolio or more utility for the individual.
                              Portfolio managers need to be familiar with risk management not only to improve
                          the portfolio’s risk–return outcome, but also because of two other ways in which
                          they use risk management at an enterprise level. First, they help to manage their own
                          companies that have their own enterprise risk issues. Second, many portfolio assets
                          are claims on companies that have risks. Portfolio managers need to evaluate the
                          companies’ risks and how those companies are addressing them.
                              This reading takes a broad approach that addresses both the risk management
                          of enterprises in general and portfolio risk management. The principles underlying
                          portfolio risk management are generally applicable to the risk management of financial
                          and non-financial institutions as well.
                              The concept of risk management is also relevant to individuals. Although many
                          large organizations formally practice risk management, most individuals practice
                          it more informally and some practice it haphazardly, oftentimes responding to risk
                          events after they occur. Although many individuals do take reasonable precautions
                          against unwanted risks, these precautions are often against obvious risks. The more
                          subtle risks are often ignored. Unfortunately, many individuals do not view risk man-
                          agement as a formal, systematic process that would help them achieve not only their
                          financial goals but also the ultimate goal, or maximum utility as economists like to
                          call it, but they should.
                              Although the primary focus of this reading is on institutions, we will also cover
                          risk management as it applies to individuals. We will show that many common themes
                          underlie risk management—themes that are applicable to both organizations and
                          individuals.
                              Although often viewed as defensive, risk management is a valuable offensive weapon
                          in the manager’s arsenal. In the quest for preferred outcomes, such as higher profit,
                          returns, or share price, management does not usually get to choose the outcomes but
                          does choose the risks it takes in pursuit of those outcomes. The choice of which risks
                          to undertake through the allocation of its scarce resources is the key tool available
                          to management. An organization with a comprehensive risk management culture in
                          place, in which risk is integral to every key strategy and decision, should perform
                          better in the long-term, in good times and bad, as a result of better decision making.
                              The fact that all businesses and investors engage in risky activities (i.e., activities
                          with uncertain outcomes) raises a number of important questions. The questions that
                          this reading will address include the following:
                              ■   What is risk management, and why is it important?
                              ■   What risks does an organization (or individual) face in pursuing its
                                  objectives?
                              ■   How are an organization’s goals affected by risk, and how does it make risk
                                  management decisions to produce better results?

    The answers to these questions collectively help to define the process of risk man-
agement. This reading is organized along the lines of these questions. Sections 2 and 3
describe the risk management process, and Sections 4–6 discuss risk governance and
risk tolerance. Sections 7 and 8 cover the identification of various risks, and Sections
9–11 addresses the measurement and management of risks.




RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
                                                                                             2
              define risk management

Risk, broadly speaking, is exposure to uncertainty. Risk is also the concept used to
describe all of the uncertain environmental variables that lead to variation in and
unpredictability of outcomes. More colloquially, risk is about the chance of a loss or
adverse outcome as a result of an action, inaction, or external event.
     This last view may make it sound as if risk is something to be avoided. But that
is not at all the case. Risk is a key ingredient in the recipe for business or investment
success; return without risk is generally a false hope and usually a prescription for
falling short of one’s goals. Risks taken must be carefully chosen, understood, and
well-managed to have a chance at adding value through decisions. Risk and return
are the interconnected forces of the financial universe. Many decision makers focus
on return, which is not something that is easily controlled, as opposed to risk, or
exposure to risk, which may actually be managed or controlled.
     Risk exposure is the extent to which the underlying environmental or market
risks result in actual risk borne by a business or investor who has assets or liabilities
that are sensitive to those risks. It is the state of being exposed or vulnerable to a
risk. Risk exposure results from the decisions of an organization or investor to take
on risk-sensitive assets and liabilities.
     Suppose there is an important announcement in Japan that will result in the yen
either appreciating or depreciating by 1%. The range of possible outcomes in real sit-
uations is clearly not as simple as the up-or-down 1% case used here, but we will use
a simplified example to make an important point. The risk is the uncertain outcome
of this event, and the currency risk to a non-Japanese business is the uncertain return
or variation in return in domestic currency terms that results from the event. The risk
can be described as the range of resulting outcomes and is often thought of in terms
of a probability distribution of future returns. Suppose that the underlying amount is
¥1,000,000. The risk exposure of a business may be zero or it could be sizable, depending
on whether the business has assets or liabilities tied to this risk—in this case, exposure
to that currency. One million yen would, in this example, result in ¥10,000 of risk
exposure (1% of ¥1,000,000). Risk management would include, among other things,
quantifying and understanding this risk exposure, deciding how and why to have the
exposure and how much risk the participant can bear, and possibly mitigating this
risk by tailoring the exposure in several ways. The risk management process would
inform the decision of whether to operate or invest in this risky currency.




   The word “risk” can be confusing because it is used by different people at dif-
   ferent times to mean so many different things. Even when used properly, the
   term has three related but different meanings, which this example illustrates
   well. Risk can mean, in turn, the underlying uncertainty, the extent of the risky

                             action taken, or the resulting range of risky outcomes to the organization. In
                             this example, the first meaning is the uncertain +1% or –1% movement of the
                             currency. The second meaning is the ¥1,000,000 worth of risky currency, the
                             position taken by the business. The third meaning is the +¥10,000 or –¥10,000
                             risky outcome that might accrue to the business for having engaged in this risky
                             activity. A common way of more precisely distinguishing among these three
                             “risks” in usage is: risk driver for the underlying risk, risk position to describe
                             or quantify the risky action taken, and risk exposure for the potential valuation
                             change that may result. In the oversimplified example above, the risk exposure is
                             simply the risk position multiplied by the risk driver. In practice the term “risk”
                             is used interchangeably for all three meanings.

                                  Risk management is the process by which an organization or individual
                                  defines the level of risk to be taken, measures the level of risk being taken,
                                  and adjusts the latter toward the former, with the goal of maximizing the
                                  company’s or portfolio’s value or the individual’s overall satisfaction, or utility.
                              Said differently, risk management comprises all the decisions and actions needed
                          to best achieve organizational or personal objectives while bearing a tolerable level
                          of risk. Risk management is not about minimizing risk; it is about actively under-
                          standing and embracing those risks that best balance the achievement of goals with
                          an acceptable chance of failure, quantifying the exposure, and continually monitoring
                          and modifying it. A company that shied away from all risk would find that it could
                          not operate. In trying to create wealth, all organizations will find themselves “in the
                          risk business.” Risk management is not about avoiding risks any more than a practical
                          diet is about avoiding calories. Risk management is not even about predicting risks.
                          “The Doctrine of No Surprises” is a key mantra among many risk managers, but it
                          does not mean they are expected to predict what will happen. Instead, it means that
                          if an unpredictable event, either positive or negative, happens in an uncertain world,
                          the impact of that event on the organization or portfolio would not be a surprise and
                          would have been quantified and considered in advance.
                              For example, a risk manager of a bank would not have been expected to know that
                          a real estate crisis was going to occur and cause significant defaults on the bank’s real
                          estate securities. But a good risk manager would help the bank’s management decide
                          how much exposure it should have in these securities by quantifying the potential
                          financial impact of such a crisis destroying, say, 60% of the bank’s capital. A good risk
                          management process would include a deep discussion at the governance level about
                          the balance between the likely returns and the unlikely—but sizable—losses and
                          whether such losses are tolerable. Management would ensure that the risk analysis
                          and discussion actively affects their investment decisions, that the potential loss is
                          continuously quantified and communicated, and that it will take actions to mitigate or
                          transfer any portion of the risk exposure that cannot be tolerated.1 The only surprise
                          here should be the market shock itself; the risk manager should have prepared the
                          organization through stress-testing and scenario analysis, continuously reporting in
                          advance on the potential impact of this sizable risk exposure.
                              A poor risk management process would have ignored the possibility, though small,
                          of such a significant market event and not quantified the potential loss from exposure
                          to a real estate crisis. As such, the bank’s management would have had no idea that
                          more than half of the bank’s capital could be at risk, not addressed this risk in any
                          governance/risk appetite discussion, ignored these risks in its investment decisions,
                          and not taken any action to mitigate this risk. In a good risk management process,

Risk Management Framework                                                                           245


most of the work is done before an adverse event happens; in a poor risk management
process, perhaps just as much work gets done, but it all comes after the event, which
is after the damage has been done.
    Good risk management does not prevent losses, but provides a full top-to-bottom
framework that rigorously informs the decision-making process—before, during,
and after a risk event. Because risks and exposures are dynamic, risk management
is a continuous process that is always being reevaluated and revised. If this process
is done well, it provides management and staff with the knowledge to navigate as
efficiently as possible toward the goals set by the governing body. In turn, this effort
increases ex ante the value of the business or investment decisions undertaken. Good
risk management may allow managers to more quickly or effectively act in the face
of a crisis. But ex post, even the best risk management may not stop a portfolio from
losing money in a market crash nor prevent a business from reduced profits in an
economic downturn.




RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
                                                                                                3
              describe features of a risk management framework
              define risk governance and describe elements of effective risk
              governance

A risk management framework flows logically from the definition of risk manage-
ment that was previously given: It is the infrastructure, process, and analytics needed
to support effective risk management in an organization. This process should fully
integrate the “risk” and “return” aspects of the enterprise into decisions in support of
best achieving its goals within its tolerance for risk. Risk management is not a “one
size fits all” solution; it is integral to the enterprise’s goals and needs. Thus, it is best
achieved through a custom solution. Despite customization, every risk management
system or framework should address the following key factors:
    ■   Risk governance
    ■   Risk identification and measurement
    ■   Risk infrastructure
    ■   Defined policies and processes
    ■   Risk monitoring, mitigation, and management
    ■   Communications
    ■   Strategic analysis or integration
    Not surprisingly, these factors often overlap in practice. They are defined and
discussed here.
    Governance is the top-level system of structures, rights, and obligations by which
organizations are directed and controlled. Normally performed at the board level,
governance is how goals are defined, authority is granted, and top-level decisions are
made. The foundation for risk management in the organization is set at the board
level as well. Risk governance is the top-down process and guidance that directs
risk management activities to align with and support the overall enterprise and is
addressed in more detail in Sections 4–6. Good governance should include defining
an organization’s risk tolerance and providing risk oversight. Governance is often
driven by regulatory concerns, as well as by the fiduciary role of the governing body.

                          A risk management committee is another facet of governance; it provides top decision
                          makers with a forum for regularly considering risk management issues. To achieve
                          the best results for an organization, risk governance should take an enterprise-wide
                          view. Enterprise risk management is an overarching governance approach applied
                          throughout the organization and consistent with its strategy, guiding the risk man-
                          agement framework to focus risk activities on the objectives, health, and value of the
                          entire organization.
                              Risk identification and measurement is the main quantitative core of risk manage-
                          ment; but more than that, it must include the qualitative assessment and evaluation of
                          all potential sources of risk and the organization’s risk exposures. This ongoing work
                          involves analyzing the environment for relevant risk drivers, which is the common
                          term used for any fundamental underlying factor that results in a risk that is relevant
                          or important to an organization, analyzing the business or portfolio to ascertain risk
                          exposures, tracking changes in those risk exposures, and calculating risk metrics to
                          size these risks under various scenarios and stresses.
                              Risks are not limited to what is going on in the financial markets. There are many
                          types of risk that can potentially impact a business, portfolio, or individual.
                              The power of technology has allowed for risk management to be more quantita-
                          tive and timely. Management can measure and monitor risk, run scenarios, conduct
                          statistical analysis, work with more complex models, and examine more dimensions
                          and risk drivers as well as do it faster. This use of technology needs to be balanced
                          with and supplement—not supplant—experienced business judgment. Technology
                          has made risk infrastructure even more important and beneficial in managing risks.
                              Risk infrastructure refers to the people and systems required to track risk expo-
                          sures and perform most of the quantitative risk analysis to allow an assessment of the
                          organization’s risk profile. Infrastructure would include risk capture (the important
                          operational process by which a risk exposure gets populated into a risk system), a
                          database and data model, analytic models and systems, a stress or scenario engine,
                          and an ability to generate reports, as well as some amount of skilled and empowered
                          personnel resources dedicated to building and executing the risk framework. With
                          increased reliance on technology, more time and effort must be allotted to test data,
                          models, and results in order to avoid the ironic outcome of the risk of errors coming
                          from within risk systems.
                              Obviously, the scope of risk infrastructure will be related to the resources, or
                          potential losses, of the organization. Individuals and smaller businesses may rely heavily
                          on an external partner or provider for much of their risk infrastructure and analysis.
                              Policies and processes are the extension of risk governance into both the day-to-day
                          operation and decision-making processes of the organization. There may be limits,
                          requirements, constraints, and guidelines—some quantitative, some procedural—to
                          ensure risky activities are in line with the organization’s predetermined risk tolerance
                          and regulatory requirements. Much of this is just common-sense business practice:
                          updating and protecting data, controlling cash flows, conducting due diligence on
                          investments, handling exceptions and escalations, and making checklists to support
                          important decisions. In a good risk framework, processes would naturally evolve to
                          consider risk at all key decision points, such as investment decisions and asset allo-
                          cation. Risk management should become an integrated part of the business and not
                          just a policing or regulatory function.
                              The process of risk monitoring, mitigation, and management is the most obvious
                          facet of a risk framework, but also one of the most difficult. Actively monitoring
                          and managing risk requires pulling together risk governance, identification and
                          measurement, infrastructure, and policies and processes and continually reviewing

and reevaluating in the face of changing risk exposures and risk drivers. It requires
recognizing when risk exposure is not aligned with risk tolerance and then taking
action to bring them back into alignment.2
    Communication of critical risk issues must happen continually and across all levels
of the organization. Governance parameters, such as risk tolerances and associated
constraints, must be clearly communicated to, and understood by, managers. Risk
metrics must be reported in a clear and timely manner. Risk issues must be reviewed
and discussed as a standard part of decision making. Changes in exposure must be
discussed so that action can be taken as appropriate. There should also be a feedback
loop with the governance body so that top-level risk guidance can be validated or
updated and communicated back to the rest of the organization.
    Strategic analysis and integration help turn risk management into an offensive
weapon to improve performance. Good risk management is a key to increasing the
value of the overall business or portfolio. A risk management framework should pro-
vide the tools to better understand the how and why of performance and help sort out
which activities are adding value, and which are not. In investing, rigorous analysis can
support better investment decisions and improve strategy and risk-adjusted returns.

Exhibit 1 illustrates the process of risk management for an enterprise, pulling all the
described elements of the risk framework together. Although there are a very high
number of risks faced by every organization, most organizations are primarily affected
by a small number of key risk drivers, or primary underlying factors that create risk.
Along the left side is risk governance, which represents board-level decisions and
encompasses and affects the boxes immediately to its right. The governance body,

248   Learning Module 6                                                       Introduction to Risk Management


                          often called a board, defines the goals of the organization and, in turn, decides on
                          its risk tolerance. It may additionally provide guidance on how or where that risk is
                          taken (risk budgeting). The board is also involved in setting high-level policies that
                          will affect most risk management processes. These risk governance activities are a
                          crucial keystone of the risk framework and will be discussed in detail in the next
                          section. When the rest of the risk framework hinges off of these top-down governance
                          elements and is focused on the goals of the entire enterprise (as shown here), the end
                          result is effective enterprise risk management.
                               The role of management, shown in the middle column, is to plan and execute
                          value-maximizing strategies consistent with their governance guidance. Each man-
                          agement activity in the framework flows not only from management (shown with
                          the arrows) but also from the governance activities on the left. Thus, not only are
                          management’s strategies designed to achieve the board’s goals, but management also
                          allocates capital to risky activities (its business or investing choices) to execute its
                          strategies consistent with the defined risk tolerance. The risk exposures that result from
                          management’s choice of activities should also be aligned with the governing body’s
                          risk budget. In addition, management participates actively in setting or implementing
                          policies and establishing procedures that relate to when, how, how much, and by whom
                          each of the other elements of the risk framework are performed.3
                               The rest of the risk management framework comprises a number of important
                          risk activities to help the business achieve all of its strategic and governance goals
                          and mandates. These other elements to implement risk management are shown in
                          the far right column of the illustration. Driven by its need to establish a risk man-
                          agement program to support the enterprise’s goals, management would provide the
                          requisite resources for risk management activities by establishing a risk management
                          infrastructure. With risk processes defined and risk infrastructure in place, risks are
                          then identified and measured, which is a regular and continual process of translat-
                          ing risk exposures (produced by the risky activities) into meaningful and generally
                          quantitative risk metrics.
                               The next major steps—risk monitoring, mitigation, and management—are where
                          much of a firm’s day-to-day risk management activity is focused. These activities are split
                          across three boxes in the illustration. Risk levels are continuously monitored, having
                          just been measured.4 There is a major decision at the monitoring stage: Management
                          must check that all the risks are in line and not outside the limits of the defined risk
                          tolerance or budget.5 This process involves evaluating the actual risk exposures com-
                          pared with the organization’s risk policies and procedures to ensure that everything
                          is in compliance. If the answer is “no,” then risk mitigation and management actions
                          need to be taken to modify risk levels and to bring them back into compliance. There
                          are a variety of methods to accomplish this task, which are addressed in Sections 9–11.
                          Whatever the method, management’s allocation of the risk budget to risky activities
                          will be altered by this modification, which includes changing the organization’s risk
                          exposures, starting the circle again through the steps on the right, and re-checking
                          to see if risk levels are now consistent with risk policies.




                          3 In essence, there could be an arrow from policies and processes to every other box to the right, but
                          these rather obvious relationships are intentionally omitted in the diagram to avoid clutter. Likewise, risk
                          exposures inform nearly all the boxes to the right. Risk management is innately quite interrelated.
                          4 Continuous usually does not mean real-time; the frequency of monitoring is based on the resources avail-
                          able, the level of systems support, and the need for risk information in the decision process. At large financial
                          firms, this monitoring will generally be daily; for small businesses and individuals it might be quarterly.
                          5 This task is generally delegated to a risk manager; but whatever the title, someone must be accountable
                          for this important check.

Risk Management Framework                                                                                249


     When risks are in line with limits, policies, tolerances, mandates, and so on, then the
process moves back to continuous monitoring followed by communicating risk levels.6
This communication, at a minimum, includes reporting key risk metrics on a regular
and timely basis across the organization to assist management in its decision-making
process and the board in fulfilling its governance duties. Finally, strategic analysis is
supported by the risk measurement, reporting, and other steps of the enterprise risk
management process. By analyzing all of the enterprise’s strategies and risky activities
via the risk measurement lens, management can improve its decision-making process
and ascertain where to invest its limited capital and risk budget most fruitfully. This
step is generally underappreciated and is an inexpensive and beneficial by-product
of having built a risk framework. The last two boxes or steps (reports and strategic
analysis) represent important feedback loops to inform and improve both governance
and the portfolio of risky activities that make up the business.
     There are many feedback loops in properly executed risk management. In practice,
most of these steps overlap most of the time and are being performed simultaneously.
Good risk management ties together all these steps from the highest governance
decisions to lower-level specifics, such as models, reports, and operational checklists.
     The risk environment is dynamic, and many of our notions of probabilities and
likely risk outcomes change in ways we probably could not predict. The risk manage-
ment framework should be robust enough to anticipate this dynamism—to expect
the unexpected. It should be evolutionary—flexible enough to grow with a company
or individual and its new challenges.
     The complexity of the risk management framework depends on the complexity
of an organization’s risk exposures and their resources. But that does not mean that
smaller organizations or individuals should skip the risk management process; they
may simply be able to do less, or have to work with external partners to assist with
large portions of the framework, or be less formal about the process. Ultimately, the
key principles just covered are still important even to the smallest organization, even
if the specific components do not get assembled as described.

THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

   Although an individual has neither the resources nor the organizational overhead
   of a large business, the importance of risk management is not diminished and
   the risk management framework still applies, albeit most likely in a scaled-down
   form. Though nearly all of the essential elements of the process illustrated in
   Exhibit 1 are still useful, the individual can reduce the recipe to six essential
   ingredients, consistent with the reduced scope of the individual’s risk exposures.
        The first step for an individual is much like that shown in Exhibit 1 for the
   most complex organization: the determination of goals or objectives. This step
   would include most of the elements associated with risk governance, just without
   all the organizational complexity.
        The next functional step involves choosing investments (or other assets) and
   identifying their risks. Lacking any risk infrastructure, the individual may at
   this stage already require the services of an investment professional or financial
   adviser. This step and subsequent steps will probably be executed by the adviser,
   although the individual principal still needs to stay knowledgeable and involved.
   In the context of the illustration in Exhibit 1, the individual is effectively their
   own governance body and the adviser serves the role of management.



6 While not obvious in the illustration, communication and reporting should happen whether or not
risk levels are in compliance; such communications are even more important when risk levels are out of
alignment with tolerances.

250   Learning Module 6                                                       Introduction to Risk Management


                                 The next steps for the individual are equivalent to the heart of the risk man-
                             agement process: risk monitoring and risk mitigation and management. The
                             individual would first evaluate their risk exposure (like the diamond or decision
                             step in the illustration), then consider various alternative approaches to modify
                             the risk if necessary, followed by implementing the risk management solution
                             (insuring, hedging, trading, etc.).
                                 The final functional step for an individual’s risk management process would
                             be evaluation and review. This step is parallel to the back-end of the risk man-
                             agement illustration, the boxes at the bottom right. This process may occur with
                             much less frequency for an individual—but it is no less important.
                                 Each individual should simplify the risk management process as required so
                             that they do not end up considering it “too esoteric and complicated to worry
                             about” and thus ignoring risk management altogether. The potential costs of
                             avoiding risk management are essentially the same for an individual as for a
                             large corporation or a hedge fund, although perhaps with less money involved.

                              At its core, business and investing are about allocating resources and capital to
                          chosen risks. Understanding which risks drive better outcomes should be one of the
                          goals of risk management, and it makes good risk management inextricably linked
                          with good management generally. When effective risk management is truly integrated
                          at all levels of the decision-making process and the overall management process,
                          the organization has developed an effective risk culture. This culture generally pro-
                          duces better results than just considering risk issues as a separate afterthought, and,
                          in turn, it produces much better results than ignoring risk issues altogether in the
                          decision-making process. For individuals, the adoption of a risk culture should result
                          in a personal awareness of the many types of risks, their rewards, the costs, the rela-
                          tionships between them, and the methods of aligning the risks borne with the risks
                          and outcomes desired. This awareness should lead to better investment return and/
                          or smaller losses for the risk taken, resulting in higher satisfaction.
                              There are a number of other benefits from establishing good risk management:
                          (1) Most obvious is less frequent surprises and a better notion of what the damage
                          would be in the event of a surprise; (2) more decision discipline leading to better con-
                          sideration of trade-offs and better risk–return relationships; (3) better response and
                          risk mitigation stemming from more awareness and active monitoring, which should
                          trim some of the worst losses; (4) better efficiency and fewer operational errors from
                          policies and procedures, transparency, and risk awareness; (5) better relations, with
                          more trust, between the governing body and management, which generally results
                          in more effective delegation; (6) a better image or reputation because analysts and
                          investors perceive a company as prudent and value-focused. Together, all these benefits
                          should lead to higher value for the enterprise.

                                B is correct. The definition of risk management includes both defining the

     means taking risks actively and in the best, most value-added way possible
     and is not about minimizing risks.

  2. Which element of a risk management framework sets the overall context for
     risk management in an organization?
      A. Governance
      B. Risk infrastructure
      C. Policies and processes
     Solution
     A is correct. Governance is the element of the risk management framework
     that is the top-level foundation for risk management. Although policies,
     procedures, and infrastructure are necessary to implement a risk manage-
     ment framework, it is governance that provides the overall context for an
     organization’s risk management.

  3. Which element of risk management makes up the analytical component of
     the process?
      A. Communication
      B. Risk governance
      C. Risk identification and measurement
     Solution
     C is correct. Risk identification and measurement is the quantitative part of
     the process. It involves identifying the risks and summarizing their poten-
     tial quantitative impact. Communication and risk governance are largely
     qualitative.

  4. Which element of risk management involves action when risk exposures are
     found to be out of line with risk tolerance?
      A. Risk governance
      B. Risk identification and measurement
      C. Risk monitoring, mitigation, and management
     Solution
     C is correct. Risk monitoring, mitigation, and management require recog-
     nizing and taking action when these (risk exposure and risk tolerance) are
     not in line, as shown in the middle of Exhibit 1. Risk governance involves
     setting the risk tolerance. Risk identification and measurement involves
     identifying and measuring the risk exposures.

                          Risk governance is the foundation for risk management. As defined earlier, it is the
                          top-down process and guidance that directs risk management activities to align with
                          and support the goals of the overall enterprise. It typically emanates from a board of
                          directors with fiduciary obligations and risk oversight and who prescribe goals and
                          authorities. Referring back to the definition of risk management, note that risk man-
                          agement is keenly focused on the risk and value of the overall enterprise.


                          An Enterprise View of Risk Governance
                          In addition to the responsibility for risk oversight, there are two other important areas
                          in which the governing body drives the risk framework. First, it determines the organi-
                          zation’s goals, direction, and priorities, which combined serve as a key foundation for
                          enterprise risk management. Recall that enterprise risk management is an overarching
                          governance approach applied across the organization that focuses risk activities on
                          the objectives, health, and value of the whole organization. Second, it spells out the
                          risk appetite or tolerance, meaning which risks are acceptable, which risks are to be
                          mitigated and to what extent, and which risks are unacceptable. Risk governance should
                          also provide a sense of the worst losses that could be tolerated in various scenarios,
                          and management should manage risk accordingly. These considerations should flow
                          naturally into decisions about risk budgeting to guide implementation of an optimal
                          program that is consistent with that risk tolerance.
                              Risk governance is the impact of the governing body of an organization on the
                          risk management framework. It provides context for and clarity on an organization’s
                          value drivers and risk appetite, specifies clear authority to management to execute
                          risk management, and ensures risk oversight to continually determine whether
                          risk management is functioning well and consistent with the organization’s value
                          maximization. It is the governing body’s job to tie the organizational goals and risk
                          framework together; thus, risk governance happens within an enterprise context. Risk
                          governance and risk oversight also entail compliance with regulatory requirements.
                          Risk governance is a difficult and demanding discipline, and if it is going to flourish
                          in an organization, it needs visible commitment from the top.
                              Providing clear guidance with sufficient leeway to execute strategy is often a dif-
                          ficult balance. Even more challenging is providing for advance discussion and a clear
                          decision and statement of organizational risk appetite. There is usually substantial
                          discussion about this risk appetite after a crisis, but too often there is very little dis-
                          cussion during periods of normalcy, when it would be much more beneficial. Because
                          risk is one of the main strategic tools that management can regulate, it is especially
                          important for governing bodies to openly discuss risk, consider scenarios, understand
                          the impact of negative outcomes on the organization, and make it clear where they
                          are not willing to venture. Much like an automobile that comes with a red zone on
                          some dials to establish boundaries for safe operation, risk governance bodies should
                          likewise establish hypothetical red zones to ensure the safe operation of their enterprise.
                              Enterprise risk management (focusing risk activities on the objectives, health, and
                          value of the whole organization) requires that the entire economic balance sheet of
                          the business be considered, not just the assets or one part of the business in isolation.
                          A narrower view of risk management is unlikely to meet the goal of maximizing the
                          value of the entire enterprise.
                              Pension fund management provides a classic example of the importance of consid-
                          ering enterprise risk management: “Funds” are the assets and “pension” is the liability.
                          But a true enterprise view requires an even broader outlook. A corporate pension
                          fund’s manager might try to maximize only the fund’s assets, but this would generally
                          do a disservice to the corporation. The assets and liabilities of a pension fund are both
                          sensitive to market variables, so ignoring the liabilities would be ignoring half the risk.
                          With liabilities that are quite bond-like, a pension fund manager using all equities

Risk Governance - An Enterprise View                                                                           253


for maximum growth would potentially make the overall fund insolvent in a market
collapse with declining interest rates because, in such a situation, the liabilities would
increase substantially in value while the assets fell. Risk tolerance for the assets in
isolation would be far different from the risk tolerance of the entire enterprise. One
should look beyond just the pension liabilities, which are likely to be a small part of
the overall enterprise. Broader still, a true enterprise risk view in this case would also
consider the parent corporation’s business risk profile and not just the pension assets
and liabilities. In a market collapse, the overall business might be in a recessionary
phase, rendering increasing contributions from the corporation to its pension fund
quite painful. Factoring the corporate risk profile into the pension fund investment
strategy may cause the risk tolerance to be lower in this case.
    Risk governance that focuses on the entire enterprise will result in risk manage-
ment that is much less likely to be at odds with the goals of the organization and more
likely to enhance long-run value. Likewise, consideration of a full spectrum of risks,
and not just the most obvious quantitative risks, will result in better risk governance.
    The enterprise view of risk management is equally applicable and important to an
individual, even if the term “enterprise” is not often used in an individual context.7
The appropriate set of risks for an individual must be viewed not in isolation, but in
consideration of the goals and characteristics of the individual in a holistic view. For
example, an adviser may be designing an investment portfolio to maximize a client’s
wealth and optimize the risk–return trade-off at some perceived comfortable level
of risk.8 But the client, whose wealth consists not only of financial assets but also of
valuable human capital, might prefer that risk allocation decisions be made in view
of both forms of capital, optimizing her total wealth. For example, a client with a
career in real estate would most likely benefit if her financial portfolio is invested in a
way that considers her earnings exposure to real estate related risks. Holdings of real
estate securities above a certain level, even if optimal from an isolated portfolio per-
spective, might make this individual less than optimally diversified from a total wealth
perspective. In another example, Investor X, who has substantial inflation-adjusted
pension benefits, is different from Investor Y, who has a fixed pension benefit, and
different still from Investor Z, who has no pension benefit and retires with solely his
own investment portfolio. These three investors will require remarkably different
investment solutions, not only to deal with inflation but also to deal with the uncer-
tainty surrounding lifespans. Individuals with different goals and characteristics will
need differing investment and risk solutions that are best suited to their individual
situations. In fact, because of the extremely variable life cycle of an individual and the
discrete nature of many individuals’ goals, the enterprise view is even more important
to risk management for individuals than it is for institutions.
    Risk governance extends into management to include ways to ensure that the risk
framework of an organization stays consistent with top-level guidance. One useful
approach is to provide a regular forum to discuss the risk framework and key risk issues
at the management level. In other words, a risk management committee would be a
key element of good risk governance. Its activities could parallel the governance body’s
risk deliberations, but at an operational level as opposed to high-level oversight. In this
forum, governance overlaps with many of the other aspects of the organization’s risk
framework as discussed in Sections 2–3. In fact, if done well, it integrates all of them.
    In the same vein, another element of good risk governance is the formal appoint-
ment of a responsible executive as chief risk officer (CRO). This officer should be
responsible for building and implementing the risk framework for the enterprise and

which deciding, coordinating, and communicating goals can be a big challenge, the scope of risk manage-
ment efforts for an individual is smaller and more manageable.

fessional or wealth manager is the “management team” executing much of the rest of the risk framework.

                          bly linked with the core business activities, the CRO is likewise a key participant in
                          the strategic decisions of the enterprise—this position is not solely a policing role.
                          Although the chief executive is responsible for risk as well as all other aspects of an
                          enterprise, it makes no more sense for the CEO to perform the role of the CRO than
                          it would be for the CEO to perform the role of the CFO. Many financial firms now
                          have a CRO in executive management,9 which had become best practice even in the
                          years prior to the 2008 crisis.




              5           RISK TOLERANCE

                                           explain how risk tolerance affects risk management

                          Perhaps the most important element of good risk governance is the risk tolerance
                          discussion and decision within the governing body. Business and investment strategy
                          centers on selecting a portfolio of acceptable risk activities that will maximize value
                          and produce the highest returns possible for the given risk level. At the governance
                          level, the duty is generally not to select these activities—a job that usually falls to
                          management—but to establish the organization’s risk appetite. Certain risks or levels
                          of risks may be deemed acceptable, other risks deemed unacceptable, and in the
                          middle are risks that may be pursued in a risk-limited fashion. Said differently, risk
                          tolerance identifies the extent to which the organization is willing to experience losses
                          or opportunity costs and to fail in meeting its objectives.




                             The risk tolerance decision for an individual is similar, but not identical, to that
                             of a business enterprise. In traditional finance theory, the individual focuses on
                             maximizing unobservable utility, whereas the business maximizes a generally
                             observable value—the market value or equity price of the company. Although
                             individuals are facing life and certain death on an uncertain timetable, most
                             businesses tend to be relatively short-lived organizations, but with an expec-
                             tation of immortality. The decisions about risk tolerance from those two very
                             different viewpoints can be expected to differ—for example, risk tolerance in
                             organizations often treats its continued existence as a major consideration. In
                             many ways, the individual’s risk tolerance decision is the harder one.

                              The enterprise risk management perspective is the right lens through which to
                          view the risk appetite question. The risk tolerance decision begins with two different
                          analyses that must be integrated—an “inside” view and an “outside” view. First, what
                          shortfalls within an organization would cause it to fail, or at least fail to achieve some
                          critical goals? Second, what uncertain forces is the organization exposed to? That is,
                          what are its risk drivers? With the answers to these two difficult questions in hand, a
                          board could begin defining dimensions and levels of risk that it finds too uncomfortable
                          to take on. This risk tolerance should be formally chosen and communicated before a
                          crisis, and will serve as the high-level guidance for management in its strategic selection


                          9 Although this is common for financial firms or other large organizations, many less-complex companies
                          will forgo a formal risk structure. The board still maintains its risk governance responsibilities; and it is
                          up to them to work out with management as to how, and to what extent, to meet these responsibilities.

of risks. Many organizations will do this after a crisis, which is better than not doing
it at all but is much like buying insurance after the loss occurs. It is best to take care
of it when there seems to be no particularly pressing reason to do so. Similarly, some
individuals may not give much thought to their own risk tolerance until after a crisis
occurs, when they belatedly decide that the risk was not worth taking.
     For example, suppose a Spanish construction equipment manufacturing company’s
board is determining its risk tolerance. From the inside perspective, it has two main
concerns: revenue and liquidity. It determines that it can tolerate a 5%−10% drop in
revenue, but that a 20% drop would trigger its debt covenants and put the launch of its
new flagship product at risk. Related to this strategy, it needs €40 million of cash flow
annually for the next three years for critical capital expenditures and can leave almost
none of this cash flow at risk. From the outside perspective, it realizes that there are
three main uncertainties or risk drivers over which it has no control: changes in the
value of the US dollar, interest rate changes, and market returns on industrial sector
equities. Both its business results and its own stock price are strongly correlated with
these three risks and could be adversely affected by any of them.
     Rather than taking a passive approach as a risk observer, the board in this example
uses a top-level analysis to formulate its risk tolerance. In this case, it may decide to
limit maximum cash flow variation to €10 million annually and revenue exposure to
−10% in a global recession. In addition, it may specify other stated limits, such as the
maximum exposure to currency or other risks. This guidance may affect the riskiness
of other product strategies that management may pursue. The company may require
more expensive financing options to reduce cash flow uncertainty. The governance
restrictions may drive risk mitigation programs, such as a hedging strategy, especially
for the primary risk drivers that are stated areas of concern.
     Governance guidance is important in helping an enterprise target where it should
actively pursue risk and where it should mitigate or modify risk. Strategic goals centered
on core competencies should be pursued, which leads the company into taking risks
that best position the enterprise for success and value creation. Companies sometimes
take risks in areas where they have no expertise, which puts their core value creation
and their entire organization at peril. A well-functioning risk program would limit
or hedge those non-core risks in areas where they have no comparative advantage.
Modifying risk is covered in detail in Sections 9–11.
     How does a company determine its risk tolerance? There is certainly no formula.
Most importantly, a company’s goals, its expertise in certain areas, and its strategies
will help a board determine which risks the company may pursue and with how much
intensity. The ability of a company to respond dynamically to adverse events may
allow for a higher risk tolerance. The amount of loss a company can sustain without
impairing its status as a going concern should factor into its risk tolerance; some
companies are more fragile than others. The competitive landscape matters because
both the board’s and investors’ expectations are usually developed in the context of
how a company is positioned in its industry. The government and regulatory land-
scape is important too, both in their ex ante demands on how companies approach
risk and in the likely ex post reaction in the event of disasters. Quantitative analyses
such as scenario analysis, economic models, and sensitivities to macro risk drivers
might be used to assess where a board’s zone of comfort is bounded. There are other
factors that should not determine risk tolerance, but in many cases they do. Personal
motivations, beliefs, and agendas of board members (the agency problem); company
size; whether the market environment seems stable; short-term pressures; and man-
agement compensation often affect risk tolerance in ways that might not be in line
with the owners’ best interests.
     Once risk tolerance is determined, the overall risk framework should be geared
toward measuring, managing, and communicating compliance with this risk tolerance—
getting the risk exposure in line with the enterprise’s risk appetite.

                              This sort of governance exercise not only helps ensure that the organization survives
                          through the worst of times, but also helps ensure a strategic trade-off between risk
                          and return in the decision process, which, in turn, improves potential returns for the
                          given level of risk and value. It is quite easy to find business strategies and investment
                          approaches that produce apparently outsized returns, but they might be at the cost of
                          putting the organization at extreme risk. A somewhat extreme example would be a
                          company selling put options on its own equity, which could produce higher short-term
                          profits but would dramatically increase the chance of the company failing in a steep
                          market decline. Excessive leverage is another risky strategy for boosting short-term
                          profits that may decrease value or lead to failure in the long run. A formal risk gover-
                          nance process with a stated risk tolerance would naturally result in avoidance of many
                          easier, less well-reasoned strategies that entail excessive risk compared with the firm’s
                          risk tolerance. Instead, it would lead the strategic discussion into alternative strategies
                          that are more likely to add value while taking reasonable risk within the enterprise’s
                          risk tolerance and not simply trade ruin for return. Sincere, good risk governance and
                          risk culture can avoid excessively risky strategies that might put the long-term enter-
                          prise value at risk. This approach should produce enhanced value for the enterprise.




              6           RISK BUDGETING

                                        describe risk budgeting and its role in risk governance

                          Risk budgeting picks up where risk tolerance leaves off. Whereas risk tolerance focuses
                          on the appetite for risk and what is and is not acceptable, risk budgeting has a more
                          specific focus on how that risk is taken. Risk budgeting quantifies and allocates the
                          tolerable risk by specific metrics; it extends and guides implementation of the risk
                          tolerance decision.
                              Risk budgeting applies to both business management and portfolio management. Its
                          foundation is the perspective that business or portfolio management involves assem-
                          bling a number of risk activities or securities, which can be collated into an assemblage
                          of various risk characteristics. For example, a traditional view of a portfolio might
                          be that it is allocated 20% to hedge funds, 30% to private equity, and the remaining
                          50% is split between stocks and bonds. An alternative risk view of the same portfolio
                          might be 70% driven by global equity returns, 20% by domestic equity returns, with
                          the remaining 10% driven by interest rates. The equity component might be allocated
                          65% to value and 35% to growth. The portfolio might also have 45% illiquid securities
                          and the remainder liquid. Other allocations can be stated in terms of exposures to
                          inflation, long-term interest rates, currencies, and so on. These multiple dimensions
                          for viewing the allocation of a portfolio are not mutually exclusive: they co-exist. If
                          one is evaluating the risk exposure of a portfolio and trying to keep it in line with a
                          stated risk tolerance, one would be far more concerned with the risk characteristics
                          of the investment assets and portfolio rather than their common classifications of
                          stocks, hedge funds, real estate, private equity, and so on. These terms tell us a little
                          about risk but not enough. Equity is traditionally riskier than hedge funds, but some
                          equities are of quite low risk and some hedge funds are of quite high risk. The risk
                          view may be more meaningful and useful in understanding the portfolio risk than the
                          traditional asset allocation view.
                              Risk budgeting is any means of allocating a portfolio based on some risk char-
                          acteristics of the investments. In the purest sense, the term “budget” implies that
                          there is a total risk limit for the organization. Although this approach is not formally

required,10 it would certainly be good practice to have a risk budget that is consistent
with the organization’s risk tolerance. A risk budget provides a means of implementing
the risk tolerance at a strategic level, or in other words, a means of bridging from the
high-level governance risk decision to the many management decisions, large and
small, that result in the actual risk exposures.
    A risk budget can be complex and multi-dimensional, or it can be a simple,
one-dimensional risk measure. Even the simplest measure can provide significant
benefits in developing an effective risk culture. Four well-known single-dimension
measures that are often used are standard deviation, beta, value at risk (VaR), and
scenario loss, but there are many others. It is common for some hedge funds to budget
risk using standard deviation, managing to a fixed-risk fund target, and evaluating
individual investments based on their returns and risks as they affect the ex ante
standard deviation.
    More complex forms of risk budgeting use multiple dimensions of risk. One popular
approach evaluates risks by their underlying risk classes, such as equity, fixed income,
commodity risk, and so on, and then allocates investments by their risk class. Also
common are risk factor approaches to risk budgeting, in which exposure to various
factors is used to attempt to capture associated risk premiums. An example would be
to budget an allocation to give greater emphasis to value stocks based on the belief
that they may provide a higher risk-adjusted return than growth stocks. This tactic
might be layered over a strategic budget with a certain “beta” as the overall equity
risk, supplemented with value and additional factor tilts specified up to some level.
    Risk budgeting, although a desirable element of risk governance, cuts across the
entire risk management framework, providing a focal point for each of the facets
of risk management described in Sections 2 and 3. And although it is true that in
practice many organizations operate without a risk budget, it is generally because
there has been no specific declaration of their risk tolerance. If a board has a clear
understanding of its risk appetite, both the board and management will want some
means of implementing a strategic allocation that is consistent with it. Thus, the risk
budget becomes a critical overarching construct for the organization’s risk framework.
    Some individuals may, often through the assistance of a financial planner, engage
in some form of risk budgeting, but many do not execute it well or carry it far enough.
A classic example of this failure is the tendency of many individuals to invest their
financial portfolios in their employers. The risk budget for their total wealth—financial
and human capital—is extremely concentrated in one firm and/or one industry. Not
surprisingly, such risk budgets typically occur not through formal planning because
most formal plans would recognize the problem, but through inaction or inattention.
    One major benefit of even the most basic risk budgeting is that it forces risk
trade-offs and supports a culture in which risk is considered as a part of all key deci-
sions. Suppose that all the activities a business wants to pursue are in excess of the
risk budget. The budgeting of risk should result in an approach, whether explicit or
not, of choosing to invest where the return per unit of risk is the highest. Better still, it
should also result in a market-benchmarked choice of risk intensity, between possibly
doing less of each risky investment or doing more, but with a risk-mitigating hedge.
This benefit is extremely important. By choosing between a market hedge or less of a
risky investment, one ends up evaluating the investment directly against the market
risk–return benchmark. Thus, one is not only comparing risk–return relationships
among one’s investment choices, but also comparing active versus passive strategies;
that is, evaluating investment choices as a whole against the “market return” on a
risk-equivalent basis. In other words, one ends up attempting to add active value in
each of one’s decisions while still staying within the confines of the organization’s risk
tolerance. The result is even more powerful than merely ensuring that the business

                          is compensated well for the risks they decide to accept. Just having a risk budget
                          in place, forces decision makers to try to add value to the enterprise in every risky
                          decision they make. The risk-budgeting framework makes this consideration innate
                          to the decision process.

                             Risk Governance

                             1. Which of the following approaches is most consistent with an enterprise
                                view of risk governance?
                                A. Separate strategic planning processes for each part of the enterprise
                                B. Considering an organization’s risk tolerance when developing its asset
                                   allocation
                                 C. Trying to achieve the highest possible risk-adjusted return on a com-
                                    pany’s pension fund’s assets
                                Solution
                                B is correct. The enterprise view is characterized by a focus on the organiza-
                                tion as a whole—its goals, value, and risk tolerance. It is not about strategies
                                or risks at the individual business line level.

                             2. Which of the following statements about risk tolerance is most accurate?
                                A. Risk tolerance is best discussed after a crisis, when awareness of risk is
                                   heightened.
                                B. The risk tolerance discussion is about the actions management will
                                   take to minimize losses.
                                 C. The organization’s risk tolerance describes the extent to which the
                                    organization is willing to experience losses.
                                Solution
                                C is correct. Risk tolerance identifies the extent to which the organization is
                                willing to experience losses or opportunity costs and fail in meeting its ob-
                                jectives. It is best discussed before a crisis and is primarily a risk governance
                                or oversight issue at the board level, not a management or tactical one.

                             3. Which of the following is not consistent with a risk-budgeting approach to
                                portfolio management?
                                A. Limiting the beta of the portfolio to 0.75
                                B. Allocating investments by their amount of underlying risk sources or
                                   factors
                                 C. Limiting the amount of money available to be spent on hedging strate-
                                    gies by each portfolio manager
                                Solution
                                C is correct. Risk budgeting is any means of allocating a portfolio by some
                                risk characteristics of the investments. This approach could be a strict limit
                                on beta or some other risk measure or an approach that uses risk classes or
                                factors to allocate investments. Risk budgeting does not require nor prohibit
                                hedging, although hedging is available as an implementation tool to support
                                risk budgeting and overall risk governance.

   4. Who would be the least appropriate for controlling the risk management
      function in a large organization?
       A. Chief risk officer
       B. Chief financial officer
       C. Risk management committee
      Solution
      B is correct. A chief risk officer or a risk management committee is an
      individual or group that specializes in risk management. A chief financial
      officer may have considerable knowledge of risk management, may super-
      vise a CRO, and would likely have some involvement in a risk management
      committee, but a CFO has broader responsibilities and cannot provide the
      specialization and attention to risk management that is necessary in a large
      organization.

               they may interact

Having laid the framework for understanding the concept of risk management and
risk governance, we now move into the implementation of the process. One of the
first important parts of the process is the identification of risks. In this reading, we
identify two general categorizations of risks. The first is the set of risks that originate
from the financial markets. Accordingly, we refer to this type of risk as financial
risks. The second group of risks includes those that emanate from outside the finan-
cial markets. As such, we refer to these as non-financial risks. Although most risks
ultimately have monetary consequences, we reserve the term “financial risks” to refer
to the risks that arise from events occurring in the financial markets, such as changes
in prices or interest rates.11 In this reading, we will consider the types of financial and
non-financial risks faced by organizations and individuals.


Financial Risks
The risk management industry has come to classify three types of risks as primarily
financial in nature. The three primary types of financial risks are market risk, credit
risk, and liquidity risk. Market risk is the risk that arises from movements in interest
rates, stock prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices. This categorization is not
to say that these four main factors are the underlying drivers of market risks. Market
risks typically arise from certain fundamental economic conditions or events in the
economy or industry or developments in specific companies. These are the underlying
risk drivers, which we will cover later.




11 We use the term “financial markets” in a very broad sense. A company may also be exposed to com-
modity price risk, which we would include as a financial risk.

                               Market risks are among the most obvious and visible risks faced by most organi-
                          zations and many individuals. The financial markets receive considerable attention
                          in the media, and information on financial market activity is abundant. Institutional
                          investors and many corporations devote considerable resources to processing this
                          information with the objective of optimizing performance. Many individuals also
                          devote considerable attention to market risk, and financial publications and television
                          and radio shows are widely followed in the general population. The state of knowledge
                          in risk management is probably greatest in the area of market risk.
                               The second primary financial risk is credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss if one
                          party fails to pay an amount owed on an obligation, such as a bond, loan, or derivative,
                          to another party. In a loan, only one party owes money to the other. In some types of
                          derivatives, only one party owes money to the other, and in other types of derivatives,
                          either party can owe the other. This type of risk is also sometimes called default risk
                          and sometimes counterparty risk. As with market risk, the root source of the risk
                          can arise from fundamental conditions in the economy, industry, or weakness in the
                          market for a company’s products. Ultimately, default is an asset-specific risk. Bond
                          and derivatives investors must consider credit risk as one of their primary decision
                          tools.12 Similar to market risk, credit risk is also a highly visible risk with considerable
                          attention paid to defaults, bankruptcies, and the stresses arising from inadequate
                          cash flow in relation to leverage. Credit risk is a particularly significant risk in that
                          although market prices can go down and bounce back up, defaults and bankruptcies
                          have extremely long-term implications for borrowers.
                               Although market and credit risk are extremely common risks to institutions, they
                          are also assumed by individuals in their personal investments. One other financial
                          risk, however, is much more common to institutions, although it can be faced by
                          individuals, often unknowingly. This third risk is liquidity risk, which is the risk of a
                          significant downward valuation adjustment when selling a financial asset. In order to
                          sell an asset, a party may need to reduce the price to a level that is less than the marked
                          value or the seller’s assessment of the asset’s true value based on the fundamentals
                          of the asset. In certain market conditions, the seller must make a significant price
                          concession. Having to make price concessions is not necessarily unusual and does
                          not imply a poorly functioning market. Indeed, given no shift in demand, a rightward
                          shift of a supply curve in order to sell a larger quantity is entirely consistent with the
                          notion that a seller must lower the price to sell a greater quantity.
                               All assets have transaction costs in the market, such as the bid–ask spread. The
                          existence of a sell price that is less than a buy price, however, is not a risk but simply
                          a cost. It is the uncertainty of that valuation spread that creates this type of risk. Thus,
                          liquidity risk could also be called “transaction cost risk.” The liquidity risk of a $10
                          stock purchased for $10 is not the risk that one would receive the “bid” price of only
                          $9.99 right after one bought it. That $0.01 spread is a known cost when the stock is
                          purchased, so it is not a risk. The risk is that this spread cost might increase dramat-
                          ically as a result of either changing market conditions or attempting to maintain a
                          position significantly larger than the normal trading volume for the stock. This problem
                          becomes a serious issue for risk management when the liquidation price falls to less
                          than the seller’s estimate of the fundamental value of the asset. Although this risk is
                          often associated with illiquid assets,13 it really stems from a couple of sources. First,
                          market liquidity varies over time and the market for specific assets may become less


                          12 With certain derivatives (swaps and forwards), either party could be forced to pay off to the other,
                          so each party is concerned about whether its counterparty will pay off, meaning that for some products,
                          credit risk is bilateral.
                          13 The illiquid nature of an asset is not itself the risk because that is a direct cost borne immediately upon
                          purchase. Still, uncertainty around the valuation of illiquid assets is a pervasive issue, so it is natural to
                          associate liquidity risk with liquidity characteristics. More importantly, though, the term liquidity risk also
                          commonly refers to a much broader set of risks for the organization, which are addressed in the next section.

liquid; second, as the size of a position increases, the cost and uncertainty associated
with liquidating it will increase. In some extreme cases, there may be no price above
zero at which the seller can sell the asset.
     Of course, one might argue that the cost of illiquidity, and liquidity risk, should
thus be part of the investor’s assessment of fundamental value, and indeed it is for
many analysts. If not, liquidity risk can sometimes be confused with a form of valu-
ation denial in which investors believe that they paid an appropriate price and that
the market has not converged to its true value. But less liquidity means a thin market
and a lack of investor interest, which may be fertile ground for investment opportu-
nities. Although lack of liquidity can offer benefits, such as the opportunity to buy an
asset well before everyone else sees that it is an attractive investment, liquidity risk
is generally considered to be a negative factor with which risk managers and indeed
all investors must contend.


Non-Financial Risks
Recall that we refer to financial risks as those arising primarily from events occurring
in the financial markets. Although most risks have monetary consequences, there are
a number of risks that are typically classified as non-financial in nature. These risks
arise from a variety of sources, such as from actions within the organization or from
external origins, such as the environment as well as from the relationship between the
organization and counterparties, regulators, governments, suppliers, and customers.
    One important risk of this type is closely related to default risk but deals more with
the settling of payments that occur just before a default. This risk is called settlement
risk. As an example, suppose Party A enters into a forward contract to purchase ¥200
million of Japanese government bonds from Party B. At expiration if all goes well,
Party A would wire the money and Party B would transfer the bonds. Each party
fulfills its obligation expecting that the other will do so as well. However, suppose
Party A wires the money but Party B does not send the bonds because it has declared
bankruptcy. At this point, Party A cannot get the money back, except possibly much
later through the potentially slow and cumbersome bankruptcy process.14 Although
the financial consequences are very high, the root source of this risk is the timing of
the payment process itself.
    Organizations face two types of risks related to the law, and as such, this risk is
referred to as legal risk. One risk is simply the risk of being sued over a transaction
or for that matter, anything an organization does or fails to do. In financial risk man-
agement, however, the major legal concern is that the terms of a contract will not
be upheld by the legal system. For example, suppose Bank E enters into a derivatives
contract with Party F. Assume that as the underlying changes in price, Party F incurs
a loss, whereas there is a corresponding gain to Bank E. But suppose that Party F then
identifies a legal issue that it interprets as giving it the right to refuse to pay. If the
court upholds Party F’s position, Bank E could incur a loss. Litigation always involves
uncertainty because even a seemingly weak case can prevail in court.
    The following three non-financial risks are related: regulatory risk, accounting risk,
and tax risk. They could even be collectively referred to as compliance risk because
they all deal with the matter of conforming to policies, laws, rules, and regulations
as set forth by governments and authoritative bodies, such as accounting governing
boards. Obviously the regulatory, accounting, and tax environment is always subject
to change, but the rapid expansion of financial products and strategies in relation to
the relatively slow manner in which government and private regulators are able to


14 This type of risk often arises because of significant time zone differences. Settlement risk is also called
Herstatt risk; Herstatt was the name of a German bank that failed in 1974 after receiving “overnight”
payments and then defaulting.

                          respond means that laws and regulations are nearly always catching up with the finan-
                          cial world. When these laws and regulations are updated, it can result in significant
                          unexpected costs, back taxes, financial restatements, and penalties.
                              Another type of non-financial risk is model risk, which is the risk of a valuation
                          error from improperly using a model. This risk arises when an organization uses the
                          wrong model or uses the right model incorrectly. A simple example applicable to both
                          a portfolio manager and a corporate analyst is the assumption of constant dividend
                          growth in the dividend discount model when, in fact, growth is not constant.
                              Closely related to model risk is tail risk—more events in the tail of the distribution
                          than would be expected by probability models. This risk is a facet of market risk, but
                          it also infects valuations and models when it is ignored or mishandled. Tail risk is
                          known to be especially severe for the normal distribution, which tends to be overused
                          in modeling. As an example, consider the monthly returns on the S&P 500 Index
                          from January 1950 to October 2018. The monthly average return was 0.70%, and the
                          monthly standard deviation was 4.10%. If we rank the monthly returns, we would
                          find that the largest negative return was −21.76%, which occurred in the well-known
                          market crash of October 1987. With a normal distribution, we would find that a
                          return that low would occur only once every 2,199,935 years.15 The second and third
                          worst monthly returns of −16.94% (October 2008) and −14.58% (August 1998) would
                          occur only once every 6,916 and 654 years respectively. If the normal distribution is a
                          realistic descriptor of returns, results of these magnitudes should never have occurred
                          in recorded market history, and yet we have seen three such instances. Interestingly,
                          according to the normal distribution, the largest positive return of 16.30% in October
                          1974 would occur only once every 888 years. Technically, one could argue that if we
                          go another 2,199,935 years and do not observe a monthly return as low as −21.76%,
                          then the assumption of a normal distribution might seem reasonable, but it seems
                          safe to reject the normal distribution for at least another two million years. Similar
                          comments can apply to the second and third worst returns albeit over shorter periods.
                              Many quantitative models (e.g., option models) and decision models (e.g., portfolio
                          construction and asset allocation, relying on variances and covariances in analysis and
                          decisions) ignore the existence of fat tails in returns; as a result, market risk is often
                          considered and dealt with in an oversimplified fashion. Tail risk, as the term is used
                          in practice, is important and is discussed separately because financial professionals
                          realize the implicit failure of modeling market risk. More plainly, ignoring tail risk is
                          a form of model risk. And although tail risk might seem more of a financial risk than
                          a non-financial risk, the mistake occurs internally, arising from poor choices made
                          in modeling.
                              Most of the internal risks faced by an organization are often grouped together and
                          referred to as operational risk. Operational risk is the risk that arises from inadequate
                          or failed people, systems, and internal policies, procedures, and processes, as well as
                          from external events that are beyond the control of the organization but that affect its
                          operations. Although the factors that give rise to such risks can arise externally, the
                          risks themselves are largely internal to an organization because it would be expected to
                          have its people, systems and internal policies, procedures, and processes functioning
                          effectively regardless of pressures placed on it by external forces.
                              Employees themselves are major sources of potential internal risks. Banks are
                          keenly aware of the vulnerability to employee theft, given the ease with which so many
                          employees have access to accounts and systems for making entries. But even perfectly
                          honest employees make mistakes, and some can be quite costly. The employee who
                          credits someone’s account $100,000 for a $100 deposit may have made an honest
                          mistake, but it is a mistake that could quickly lead to the rapid disappearance of

money. In the past, employees up to senior management have been guilty of perpe-
trating accounting fraud, not necessarily for their own direct benefit but to make the
company look better.
    In banks and other companies that trade in the financial markets, there is the risk
that a trader or portfolio manager will fail to follow laws, rules, or guidelines and
put the company at great financial risk. This individual is commonly described as a
“rogue trader.” Personified by Nick Leeson of Barings Bank, who in 1995 destroyed the
200-year old company by engaging in a series of highly speculative trades to cover up
losses, the rogue trader has become a standard concern of risk managers. Although
it was never clear if Leeson’s trades were truly unauthorized, his legacy left the fear
that institutions bear the risk that one trader can imperil the entire organization by
making large and highly speculative trades that put the bank’s entire capital base at
risk. In essence, a rogue trader is a trader who engages in risky transactions without
regard for the organization’s limits or conforming to its controls.
    Organizations are also threatened by business interruptions, such as those caused
by extreme weather and natural disasters. Events such as floods, earthquakes, or
hurricanes can cause significant damage and temporarily shut down an organization.
Although extreme weather and natural disasters are external forces that are completely
out of the control of an organization, it does not excuse the organization from having
the appropriate internal procedures for managing problems caused by their external
environment. Simple and fairly low-cost actions, such as having generators, backup
facilities, or providing employees the option to work remotely, can go a long way
toward keeping employees working during extreme weather events and when natural
disasters strike. Yet, some organization have not heeded inclement weather forecasts.
Failing to react to warnings can result in considerable loss.
    In a world that is increasingly digital, cyber risk is a major operational risk that
spares no organization and that can have significant consequences. Organizations
are expected to understand and manage the risk associated with the disruption of or
failure related to their information technology (IT) systems. For example, a hacker
breaking into a company’s IT system and stealing customer or client data is an exter-
nal threat. Hacking, however, is not simply a random act of mischief. Companies
are aware of the threat of hackers, and hackers can break in to a system only if that
system is vulnerable. An organization is responsible for ensuring cyber security and
establishing sufficiently robust IT safeguards, such as data encryption, to deter hackers
from breaking in and either stealing or causing disruption. Cyber-attacks and data
breaches can have serious reputational and compliance consequences. For example,
all organizations targeting European citizens must comply with the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and notify regulators and data subjects of any data
breaches regarding sensitive personal information within 72 hours. Failure to do so
can lead to fines of several million euros, including for organizations based outside
the European Union. In addition to the threats posed by hackers and viruses, even
secure IT systems themselves are a particular source of risk. Programming errors and
bugs can create the possibility of costly mistakes.
    Terrorism is another form of operational risks that poses a threat to organizations
and individuals. The 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center led many companies to
recognize that the New York City financial district was a major terrorist target and that,
as such, their operations could be shut down by these acts of violence. When the more
destructive attacks of 11 September 2001 occurred, many organizations had already
established backup facilities sufficiently far away from that area. Of course, such risk
is not confined to major financial centers, and indeed, organizations worldwide have
begun to take security measures that address this operational risk.

                               Some of these operational risks are insurable, at least to a modest extent. We
                          will briefly discuss insurance later, but most companies would much prefer to take
                          proactive steps toward prevention than to incur the inconvenience of losses and then
                          have an outside organization compensate them for their losses.
                               Solvency risk is the risk that the organization does not survive or succeed because
                          it runs out of cash, even though it might otherwise be solvent.16 This was probably
                          the most underappreciated component of risk prior to the financial crisis of 2008.17
                          The collapse of Lehman Brothers was often associated with an excess of leverage,
                          which was certainly a key factor in its failure. But it was solvency risk that forced the
                          company into bankruptcy. Almost overnight, Lehman’s liquidity disappeared because
                          most funding sources would no longer willingly bear Lehman’s counterparty risk. Even
                          if it had experienced large market gains on the day it went under, it had already been
                          destroyed by solvency risk. Across the entire financial industry, from hedge funds to
                          pension funds, painful but valuable lessons were learned about the critical impor-
                          tance of funds availability and solvency risk, even if all other risks were well-aligned.
                          Solvency risk is now viewed as one of the key factors in running a successful hedge
                          fund because investors are extremely sensitive to not recovering their investment in
                          the event of a “run on the fund.”
                               Solvency, in the personal or institutional sense, is the availability of funding to
                          continue to operate without liquidating—or at a less extreme level, to be able to
                          make good on liabilities and meet one’s cash flow requirements. Solvency risk is the
                          ultimate example of the importance of taking an enterprise view of risk management.
                          For example, a university’s investment officer might have a perfectly well-balanced
                          set of risks in the endowment portfolio when viewed in isolation. But as a part of a
                          university, the portfolio may be affected by a deep recession because the university’s
                          professional degree revenue, grant money, and donations will fall at the same time as
                          the portfolio’s investment value and cash distributions are in decline. Although the
                          endowment and university may survive, it might be necessary for the endowment to
                          take many emergency actions that impair its value, simply attributable to the overall
                          solvency risk and the ultimate need of the enterprise to not run out of cash.
                               Solvency risk is easily mitigated, though never eliminated, by a large number of
                          possible safeguards, none of which is free. Many businesses produce short-term higher
                          returns by essentially ignoring solvency risk, but in doing so, they are not managing risk
                          very well. Since the 2008 crisis, most businesses are keenly aware of the consequences
                          of bad solvency management, and have taken such steps as using less leverage, securing
                          more stable sources of financing, investing in models to provide more transparency
                          on solvency risk, incorporating solvency risk at an enterprise level in risk governance,
                          and holding more cash equivalents and assets with less liquidity risk.
                               Individuals can also face a number of risks of an operational nature. These include
                          hackers breaking into one’s computer and the threat of burglary and robbery. One
                          of the most commonly cited risks for individuals is identity theft. For individuals,
                          however, we consider their primary non-financial risks to be related to their life and
                          health as well as other life-changing events.
                               Obviously, the health of an individual is an extremely important risk. Poor health
                          can result from poor choices in life, but it can also arise from factors that are outside
                          the control of the individual. These risks can result in direct health care expenses,
                          reduced income because of disability, and reduced lifespan or quality of life. People
                          vary widely in the risk management strategies they undertake to control their health,


                          16 Solvency risk is often referred to as liquidity risk by industry professionals, even though the expression
                          liquidity risk was used earlier to refer to the risk of valuation shock when selling a security. Although the
                          term “liquidity risk” is used in practice in both contexts, in this reading we will refer to the risk relating to
                          the cash position of an organization as “solvency risk.”
                          17 Bank runs are perhaps the simplest example of solvency risk. An otherwise solvent bank can easily be
                          ruined by a bank run that wipes out its ability to make good on short-term liabilities.

Interactions Between Risks                                                                         265


such as in their choices in diet, exercise, preventive health care, and avoidance of
undue health risks. Some individuals address only their financial exposure to health
risks, and still others do not take proactive steps to address this risk at all.
    Closely related to health risk is mortality risk—the risk of dying relatively young—
and longevity risk—the risk of outliving one’s financial resources. Not only are these
risks a primary determinant of the quality of life, they are also critical factors in
investment planning. Although it is probably desirable not to know when one will die,
financial planning for one’s years in retirement is heavily dependent on one’s mortal-
ity assumption. Insurance companies, defined benefit pension plans, and vendors of
retirement annuities need only know the group average mortality. Mortality tables
are reasonably accurate, so these institutions have relatively precise estimates of death
rates for groups as a whole. Individuals themselves, however, clearly do not know
how long they will live. People who use defined contribution plans must therefore
build portfolios and control retirement distributions so that their assets outlive them,
which is difficult to do when they do not know when they will die. No one wants to
outlive their money, but with an increasingly aging population and good health care,
this problem is becoming a greater concern.
    There are a number of other major non-financial risks that individuals face, which
are generally involved with some sort of life-changing disaster. The largest ones—fire,
natural disaster, or massive liability stemming from harming others, such as in a car
accident—are generally considered “property and casualty” risks and are insured as
such.




INTERACTIONS BETWEEN RISKS
                                                                                               8
              identify financial and non-financial sources of risk and describe how
              they may interact

In some cases, a risk classified into one category could easily have been classified into
another. Indeed, the interactions between risks are numerous. It has been said that
market risk begets credit risk, which begets operational risk. That is, given unexpected
market moves, one party then owes the other party money. Given the debtor–creditor
nature of the relationship, the two parties must have internal operations that process
the transactions and pay or collect the money. Thus, whenever there is credit risk,
there is settlement risk. If there were no market risk, the other risks in the chain would
likely be relatively minor. Legal risk often arises from market or credit risk. Large
market moves create losses for one party. There is a long history of parties searching
for loopholes in contracts and suing to avoid incurring the loss.
    One simple example of an adverse risk interaction is counterparty risk. When
trading a derivative contract, it is important to consider the cost of counterparty
risk. Suppose Party A buys an out-of-the-money put option with a strike price of
¥1000—a contract theoretically worth ¥100 entitling him to as much as ¥1000 from
Counterparty C if an underlying equity index is down. But there is a 2% chance that
C could default; and assume that the possibility of default is considered independent
of the performance of the equity market. This transaction, with payoffs adjusted for
the possibility of default, might price at, say, ¥98 to A. But in reality, the credit risk
of C’s default is likely dependent on the equity market return. If the probability dis-
tribution of default risk overlaps substantially with that of the market being down,
which is a likely scenario, then the risks interact, and the cost of risk is higher. In this
example, perhaps the probability of C defaulting is 10% or more when the put option

                          is in the money. So, A’s expected payoff is lower as a result of facing a credit risk that
                          is compounded by market risk. In fact, it is quite likely that in the extreme event—a
                          deep decline in the equity market when A would presumably receive ¥1000—Party
                          A will in all likelihood get nothing. Thus, the investor bears much more risk than
                          initially thought as a result of the failure to consider the interaction of the two risks.
                          And in doing so, Party A overpaid for the contract. This sort of risk interaction is so
                          common in markets that practitioners have given it a very fitting term—“wrong-way
                          risk.” In fact, it was extremely common in the financial crisis of 2008, when holders of
                          many securities based on mortgage credit believed that the risks were well-diversified
                          when in truth, the risks were quite systematic.
                               Another example of interacting risks was experienced by many banks, funds, and
                          private investment partnerships in 2008, as well as the hedge fund Long-Term Capital
                          Management in 1998. Leverage, which manifested itself in higher market risk, inter-
                          acted in an extremely toxic manner with liquidity risk and solvency risk and impaired
                          or shuttered many investment firms.18
                               In most adverse financial risk interactions, the whole is much worse than the
                          sum of its parts; the combined risk compounds the individual risks in a non-linear
                          manner. For this example, a 2× levered organization might produce a 2% loss when
                          its unlevered twin or baseline risk bears a 1% loss. If liquidity is a serious issue for the
                          organization, then at a 10% baseline loss, the organization might face some moderate
                          distress from liquidity or funding problems that it ends up losing 25% instead of 20%. It
                          would not be surprising if this organization failed at a 30% baseline loss because of the
                          toxic interplay between levered risk and liquidity problems. This resulting non-linear
                          reaction to risk drivers exists across many risk interactions in many markets, making
                          up-front scenario planning even more valuable to the risk process, a point we will
                          return to later.
                               Earlier, we briefly described a common example of interacting risks for individuals.
                          Suppose an individual works for a publicly traded company and, through an incentive
                          program, receives shares of the company in her company retirement portfolio or for
                          her personal holdings. Company policies may require that employees hold on to these
                          shares for a number of years. When that time has elapsed, however, many individuals
                          fail to recognize the incredibly concentrated risk they are assuming, so they hold on
                          to their shares. An employee’s reasoning for not selling the shares is often that the
                          company she works for has been a solid performing company for many years, so she
                          feels no reason to worry. Moreover, the team spirit often imbued in employees gen-
                          erates pride that can make employees believe that there is no better place in which
                          to work and to invest their money. But if something goes wrong in the company or
                          the industry, the employee may lose her job and her savings—an incredibly adverse
                          interaction between market risk and human capital risk. The 2003 collapse of Enron
                          remains a powerful historical example, with many loyal and honest employees losing
                          virtually all of their retirement savings by failing to recognize this risk.
                               In sum, it is important to recognize that risks do not usually arise independently,
                          but generally interact with one another, a problem that is even more critical in stressed
                          market conditions. The resulting combined risk is practically always non-linear in that
                          the total risk faced is worse than the sum of the risks of the separate components.
                          Most risk models and systems do not directly account for risk interactions, which
                          makes the consequences of the risk interaction even worse. Governance bodies,
                          company management, and financial analysts should be keenly aware of the potential
                          risk and damage of risks in combination, and be aware of the dangers of treating risks
                          as separate and unrelated.


                          18 This example illustrates yet another risk, systemic risk, that is a significant concern to regulators and
                          governments. Stresses and failures in one sector transmit to stresses and failures in other sectors, which
                          can ultimately impact an entire economy. Systemic risk is the ultimate example of interactions among risks.

Interactions Between Risks                                                               267


EXAMPLE 3

  Financial and Non-Financial Sources of Risk

  1. Which of the following is not a financial risk?
      A. Credit risk
      B. Market risk
      C. Operational risk
     Solution
     C is correct. Operational risk is the only risk listed that is considered non-fi-
     nancial, even though it may have financial consequences. Credit and market
     risks derive from the possibility of default and market movements, respec-
     tively, and along with liquidity risk, are considered financial risks.

  2. Which of the following best describes an example of interactions among
     risks?
      A. A stock in Russia declines at the same time as a stock in Japan
         declines.
      B. Political events cause a decline in economic conditions and an increase
         in credit spreads.
      C. A market decline makes a derivative counterparty less creditworthy
         while causing it to owe more money on that derivative contract.
     Solution
     C is correct. Although most risks are likely to be interconnected in some
     way, in some cases the risks an organization is exposed to will interact in
     such a way that a loss (or gain) in one exposure will lead directly to a loss in
     a different exposure as well, such as with many counterparty contracts. Con-
     ditions in A and B are much more directly linked in that market participants
     fully expect what follows—for example, in B, an outbreak of war in one
     region of the world could well cause widespread uncertainty; a flight to qual-
     ity, such as to government-backed securities; and a widening in spreads for
     credit-risky securities. In C, in contrast, the reduction in creditworthiness
     following the market decline may be expected, but owing more money on an
     already existing contract as a result comes from the interaction of risks.

  3. Which of the following best describes a financial risk?
      A. The risk of an increase in interest rates.
      B. The risk that regulations will make a transaction illegal.
      C. The risk of an individual trading without limits or controls.
     Solution
     A is correct because this risk arises from the financial markets.

  4. Which of the following is not an example of model risk?
      A. Assuming the tails of a returns distribution are thin when they are, in
         fact, fat.
      B. Using standard deviation to measure risk when the returns distribu-
         tion is asymmetric.

                                 C. Using the one-year risk-free rate to discount the face value of a one-
                                    year government bond.
                                Solution
                                C is correct. The risk-free rate is generally the appropriate rate to use in
                                discounting government bonds. Although government bonds are generally
                                default free, their returns are certainly risky. Assuming a returns distribu-
                                tion has thin tails when it does not and assuming symmetry in an asymmet-
                                ric distribution are both forms of model risk.

                             5. Which of the following is the risk that arises when it becomes difficult to sell
                                a security in a highly stressed market?
                                A. Liquidity risk
                                B. Systemic risk
                                 C. Wrong-way risk
                                Solution
                                A is correct. Securities vary highly in how liquid they are. Those with low
                                liquidity are those for which either the number of agents willing to invest
                                or the amount of capital these agents are willing to invest is limited. When
                                markets are stressed, these limited number of investors or small amount
                                of capital dry up, leading to the inability to sell the security at any price the
                                seller feels is reasonable. Systemic risk is the risk of failure of the entire fi-
                                nancial system and a much broader risk than liquidity risk. Wrong-way risk
                                is the extent to which one’s exposure to a counterparty is positively related
                                to the counterparty’s credit risk.

                             6. The risks that individuals face based on mortality create which of the follow-
                                ing problems?
                                A. The risk of loss of income to their families.
                                B. Covariance risk associated with their human capital and their invest-
                                   ment portfolios.
                                 C. The interacting effects of solvency risk and the risk of being taken
                                    advantage of by an unscrupulous financial adviser.
                                Solution
                                A is correct. The uncertainty about death creates two risks: mortality risk
                                and longevity risk. The mortality risk (risk of dying relatively young) is man-
                                ifested by a termination of the income stream generated by the person. In
                                contrast, longevity risk is the risk of outliving one’s financial resources.

Measuring and Modifying Risk: Drivers and Metrics                                                          269


The core element of risk management is the measurement and modification of risk.
One cannot modify risk without measuring it. The primary purpose of measuring risk
is to determine whether the risk being taken, or being considered, is consistent with
the pre-defined risk tolerance. To understand how risk is measured, it is important
to understand the basic elements that drive risk.


Drivers
This section illustrates the origins of risk. Risk is a part of life itself. None of us knows
from one day to the next everything that will happen to us in the next 24 hours, let
alone over a longer period. We may get a phone call that a relative is extremely sick,
or we may be contacted by a head-hunter about an attractive job possibility. We may
learn that we are going to be given an award from a prestigious organization, or we
may find that our identity has been stolen. All of us can almost surely name something
that happened the previous day that was not anticipated. Most of these happenings
are minor and often quickly forgotten. Others are serious. Some are good. Some are
bad. Some are unpredictable outcomes of known events, such as whether we get an
offer following a job interview or whether a medical test reveals that we are healthy
or ill. Some events are completely unanticipated, such as getting a phone call from an
old friend we have not talked to in many years or having a flat tire on the drive home.
Fortunately, the vast majority of risks in life are minor. The ones that are not minor,
however, have the potential to be highly unpredictable and financially, and sometimes
physically and emotionally, quite costly.
     In a conceptual sense, financial risks are no different from the other risks we face
in life. All risks arise from the fact that the future is unknown. Financial risks largely
emanate from economic risks, and economic risks emanate from the uncertainties
of life.
     Financial markets generate prices that fluctuate as investors absorb information
about the global and domestic state of the economy, the company’s industry, and the
idiosyncratic characteristics of the company itself. Global and domestic macroeco-
nomies are driven by the companies that operate within them, but much of the tone
as well as the ground rules are set by governments and quasi-governmental agencies,
such as central banks. Taxes, regulations, laws, and monetary and fiscal policy establish
a legal and economic environment and a set of ground rules that greatly affect the
degree and quality of economic activity that takes place. Attempts by governments
and central banks of different countries to coordinate economic policies can lead to
some degrees of success if harmonized, but if not, they can create an environment in
which companies engage in practices designed to seek favorable treatment in some
countries and avoid unfavorable treatment in others.19
     All economies, in turn, are composed of industries. Government policies also
affect industries, in some cases encouraging economic activity in some industries
while discouraging it in others. Some industries are stable, weathering macroeconomic
storms quite well, whereas others are highly cyclical.
     The uncertainties of global and domestic macroeconomic and central bank policies
create risks for economies and industries that we often treat as systematic. Seemingly
minor events, such as filling the position of central bank chairperson, are often viewed
by investors as major events, signaling possibly a change in policy that can greatly
affect the macroeconomy and possibly certain industries.




19 This practice is sometimes called regulatory arbitrage. The policies of certain countries can be more
conducive to establishing operations. Examples are the flow of money into countries whose banking laws
are less restrictive and more conducive to secrecy and incorporation in or moving a company to a country
with lighter regulations or more favorable tax treatment.

                               Moving down to a more fundamental level, investors face the unsystematic or
                          idiosyncratic risks of individual companies. Modern investment analysis prescribes
                          that diversified portfolios bear no unsystematic risk. We are then led to believe that
                          unsystematic risk does not matter in a well-diversified portfolio. But unsystematic
                          risk does matter to the management of a company. It also matters to poorly diver-
                          sified investors. And it certainly matters to the financial analysts who cover specific
                          companies. And what would appear to be unsystematic risk can oftentimes actually
                          be systematic. For example, poor credit risk management by a major bank can turn
                          into a global financial crisis if that bank is “too big to fail.”
                               In sum, the basic drivers of risk arise from global and domestic macroeconomies,
                          industries, and individual companies. Risk management can control some of this risk,
                          but it cannot control all of it. For example, the risk manager of a company may be able
                          to reduce the likelihood that his company will default, but he cannot control move-
                          ments in interest rates. For the latter risk, he must accept that interest rate volatility
                          is a given and that he can only position the company to be able to ensure that its risk
                          exposure is aligned with its objective and risk tolerance. In order to do so, he must
                          first be able to measure the risk.


                          Metrics
                          The notion of metrics in the context of risk refers to the quantitative measures of risk
                          exposure. The most basic metric associated with risk is probability. Probability is a
                          measure of the relative frequency with which one would expect an outcome, series
                          of outcomes, or range of outcomes to occur. One can speak about the probability of
                          rolling a six in one roll of a die as 1/6, the chance of rain in the next 24 hours as 20%,
                          or the odds of a central bank taking actions to increase interest rates of 50%. These
                          are all probabilities, differing in concept by the fact that the die roll is associated
                          with an objective probability measure, whereas the other two examples are subjective
                          probabilities. It is important to note that probability, in and of itself, is not a sufficient
                          metric of risk. A chance of financial loss of 25% does not tell us everything we need
                          to know. There are other measures of risk that incorporate probability but give us
                          more information.
                               The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion in a probability distribution.
                          Although there is a formal mathematical definition of standard deviation, at this point
                          we need only understand the conceptual definition. Standard deviation measures a
                          range over which a certain percentage of the outcomes would be expected to occur.
                          For example, in a normal distribution, about 68% of the time the outcomes will lie
                          within plus or minus one standard deviation of the expected value. Two standard
                          deviations in both directions would cover about 95% of the outcomes, whereas three
                          would encompass 99% of the outcomes. Although standard deviation, or volatility,
                          is widely used in the financial world, it does have significant limitations. In partic-
                          ular, standard deviation may not be an appropriate measure of risk for non-normal
                          distributions. Standard deviation may not exist for return distributions with fat tails.
                               Moreover, according to modern portfolio theory, the risk captured by an asset’s
                          standard deviation overstates the risk of that asset’s returns in the context of a diver-
                          sified portfolio. Investors can easily diversify their holdings, thereby eliminating a
                          portion of the risk in their portfolios by diversifying away the security-specific risk.
                          As a result, most financial valuation theories assert that the ability of investors to
                          eliminate security-specific risk, or non-systematic risk, means that investors should
                          not expect to earn a premium to compensate them for the assumption of this risk. As
                          a consequence, the risk of a security may be better measured by its beta, a measure

Measuring and Modifying Risk: Drivers and Metrics                                                               271


of the sensitivity of a security’s returns to the returns on the market portfolio. Beta
measures relative risk, meaning how much market risk an asset contributes to a
well-diversified portfolio.20
     Beta describes risk well for a portfolio of equities, but other sources of risk may
require other descriptive risk metrics. The risk associated with derivatives is one
example of this. Although derivatives are widely used to manage risk, they do so by
assuming other risks. Even if the derivative is being used to establish a hedge of an
existing exposure to risk, it would still result in the assumption of additional risk
because the assumed risk is being used to offset an existing risk. For example, if one
purchases a call option denominated in euros to buy Russian rubles, one would be
assuming the risk of the ruble/euro exchange rate. Because most derivatives exposures
are highly leveraged, it is critical that the risk of derivatives be properly measured.
There are several specialized measures of derivatives risk.
     The sensitivity of the derivative price to a small change in the value of the under-
lying asset is called the delta. It is perhaps the most important measure of derivatives
risk. Yet delta is limited to capturing only small changes in the value of the underlying.
Large changes are captured by the concept of gamma. Whereas delta is a first-order
risk, gamma is considered a second-order risk because it reflects the risk of changes
in delta.21 Some derivatives, such as options, are also sensitive to changes in the
volatility of the underlying. This risk is captured by a concept called vega, which is a
first-order measure of the change in the derivative price for a change in the volatility
of the underlying. Derivatives are also sensitive to changes in interest rates, which
are reflected in a measure called rho. Most options have relatively low sensitivity to
interest rates.22 These, and other mathematically derived derivatives metrics, are
collectively referred to as “the Greeks.”
     Other asset classes may have their own special metrics to describe risk. One
well-known example, duration, is a measure of the interest rate sensitivity of a
fixed-income instrument. Analogous to delta, it is a first-order risk. The wide variety
of financial instrument types and asset classes leads to a proliferation of terminology
and risk measures, with most of them having no meaning outside their asset class.
As financial organizations and asset risk modeling became more sophisticated and
computer power increased, an approach was needed to measure and describe financial
risk across the broad spectrum of asset classes. Spurred by the onset of global bank
capital regulation, this led to the development of value at risk.
     Value at risk or VaR is a measure of the size of the tail of the distribution of
profits on a portfolio or for an organization. A VaR measure contains three elements:
an amount stated in units of currency, a time period, and a probability. For example,
assume a London bank determines that its VaR is £3 million at 5% for one day. This
statement means that the bank expects to lose a minimum of £3 million in one day
5% of the time. A critical, and often overlooked word, is minimum. In this example,
the bank expects that its losses will be at least £3 million in one day with 5% prob-
ability. In a VaR measure, there is no ultimate maximum that one can state. VaR is
thus a minimum extreme loss metric. With a probability of 5% and a measurement
period of one day, we can interpret the bank’s VaR as expecting a minimum loss of £3


20 Earlier, we discussed the fact that unsystematic risk matters to some parties. Here we seem to be saying
that it should not matter to anyone. Capital market models almost always assume that investors can diversify
quite easily and, as a result, they should not expect to earn a premium for bearing diversifiable risk. This
assumption does not mean that everyone’s wealth is well-diversified. Investors who do not diversify prob-
ably cannot expect to earn a return for bearing diversifiable risk, but it does not mean that these investors
should not care about measuring the risk they choose to assume by not diversifying.
21 The notion of a first-order risk versus a second-order risk can be seen by considering the following.
Suppose A affects B and B, in turn, affects C. A does not affect C directly but does so only indirectly. A is
a first-order risk for B and a second-order risk for C.
22 Options on interest rates, however, have a high sensitivity to interest rates, but only because interest
rates are the underlying, and thus, the source of market risk.

                          million once every 20 business days. VaR can also be used to measure credit losses,
                          although the construction of the measure is considerably more difficult given the
                          extreme asymmetry of the risk.
                              VaR is a simple but controversial measure. There are several ways to estimate VaR,
                          each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. The different measures can
                          lead to highly diverse estimates. Moreover, VaR is subject to the same model risk as
                          derivative pricing models. VaR is based on a particular assumption about the probability
                          distribution of returns or profits. If that assumption is incorrect, the VaR estimate will
                          be incorrect. VaR also requires certain inputs. If those inputs are incorrect, the VaR
                          estimate will be incorrect. Many critics of VaR have argued that naive users of VaR
                          can be lulled into a false sense of security. A presumably tolerable VaR can give the
                          illusion that the risk is under control, when in fact, it is not. Yet, VaR is accepted as
                          a risk measure by most banking regulators and is approved for disclosure purposes
                          in typical accounting standards. As with any risk measure, one should supplement it
                          with other measures.
                              As emphasized earlier, VaR does not tell the maximum loss. The maximum loss is
                          the entire equity of an organization or the entire value of a portfolio, but the statistics
                          used to estimate VaR can be used to gauge average extreme losses. Conditional VaR
                          or CVaR is a common tail loss measure, defined as the weighted average of all loss
                          outcomes in the statistical distribution that exceed the VaR loss. Another tail risk
                          metric in the credit risk space that is analogous to CVaR is expected loss given default,
                          which answers the question for a debt security, “If the underlying company or asset
                          defaults, how much do we lose on average?”
                              VaR focuses on the left tail of the distribution and purports to tell us the expected
                          frequency of extreme negative returns, but it can understate the actual risk. For
                          example, the normal distribution gives us a well-defined measure of extreme negative
                          returns, which are balanced by extreme positive returns. Yet, actual historical return
                          distributions have shown that there are more extreme negative returns than would be
                          expected under the normal distribution. We previously described this concern in the
                          form of tail risk. In response to this concern, statisticians have developed a branch
                          of study that focuses primarily on extreme outcomes, which is called extreme value
                          theory, and leads to measures of the statistical characteristics of outcomes that occur
                          in the tails of the distribution. There are mathematical rules that define the statistical
                          properties of such large outcomes, and these rules have been widely used for years
                          in the insurance business. In the past 20 years or so, risk managers have taken to
                          using them to help gauge the likelihood of outcomes that exceed those that would
                          normally be expected.
                              Two measures in particular that are often used to complement VaR are scenario
                          analysis and stress testing. These are common sense approaches that ask “If this
                          happens, then how are we affected?” Scenario analysis can be thought of as a package
                          of stress tests, usually with some common underlying theme. A scenario defines a set
                          of conditions or market movements that could occur and would put some pressure
                          on a portfolio. An example might be a sharp increase in interest rates coupled with
                          a significant decline in the value of a currency. The portfolio is then evaluated to
                          determine its expected loss under these scenarios. A different means of posing a sce-
                          nario analysis is stress testing, which is done by proposing specific asset price moves
                          generally involving extremely large and high pressure scenarios that would occur only
                          rarely but would have the potential for destabilizing the entire organization. The US
                          Federal Reserve and other central banks have begun requiring major banks to stress
                          test their portfolios. Although scenario analysis and stress testing can provide some
                          information, they are, as noted previously for other measures, subject to model risk.
                              Of course, the measures just mentioned focus primarily on market risk. Credit
                          risk, which is covered in more detail in readings on fixed-income analysis, has long
                          relied heavily on the credit ratings provided by private companies, such as Moody’s

Analytics, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings. In effect, a large part of credit analysis
for many lenders has been outsourced since the early part of the 20th century. Most
lenders, however, do not rely exclusively on these rating companies. They do their
own analysis, which focuses on the creditor’s liquidity, profitability, and leverage.
Liquidity measures, such as the current ratio, may indicate how well a borrower can
cover short-term obligations. Solvency ratios, such as cash flow coverage or interest
coverage, may reveal whether a borrower generates enough cash or earnings to make its
promised interest payments. Profitability measures, such as return on assets, estimate
whether a company is sufficiently profitable so that it can easily accommodate debt.
Leverage measures, such as the ratio of debt to total assets, reflect whether a company
has sufficient equity capital in relation to its debt to absorb losses and negative cash
flows without defaulting. Credit analysis also examines the strength and cyclicality
of the macroeconomy and the company’s industry. Other widely used measures of
credit risk include credit VaR, probability of default, expected loss given default, and
the probability of a credit rating change.
    One of the problems of credit risk measurement is that credit events, such as
a ratings downgrade or a default, are relatively rare for a particular organization.
Certainly, in the aggregate there are many credit losses, but very few companies that
default have a history of defaulting. Without a history to go by, estimating the likeli-
hood of an event that has never actually occurred is extremely difficult. Imagine the
challenge of assigning a default probability to Lehman Brothers in 2007. It had been
in operation since 1850 and had never defaulted. Yet in 2008, Lehman Brothers, one
of the most successful financial companies of all time, filed for bankruptcy. Because
of the infrequency of default, risk managers normally attempt to assess default prob-
ability by aggregating companies with similar characteristics.23
    Another useful source of information for risk managers about these rare events
is the ex ante risk cost that is implied by the market pricing of derivatives. A credit
default swap (CDS) on an issuing company has an observable price that acts as a signal
to a bondholder of the risk cost of a default. Put options, exotic options, insurance
contracts, and other financial instruments may contain valuable signals of the cost of
rare adverse events, or at least the price of hedging them.
    Operational risk is one of the most difficult risks to measure. Consider the oper-
ational risk event reported in 2014 in which hackers broke into Home Depot’s credit
card data base. Assessing the likelihood of such an event and estimating the potential
losses would be almost impossible. The threat of litigation alone for years afterward
is difficult to quantify. As with credit risk, significant operational risk events are rare
but usually quite costly if they do occur. Hence, attempts to quantify the risk usually
involve a third party aggregating operational risk events across numerous companies
and publishing the statistics.
    As mentioned, there are numerous other risks that would likewise be difficult to
measure. For example, there is always the possibility of changes in accounting rules,
laws, tax rates, and regulatory requirements that can result in significant costs as
companies adapt their policies and actions from one regulatory environment to a new
one. How would one measure such risks? Moreover, the time period spanned by these
risks is extremely long, and in fact, theoretically infinite. Changes in these rules and
laws are often motivated by politics. How does one quantify such risks when there
are no real numeric measures? Analysis invariably reverts to subjective evaluation of
the likelihood of such threats and their potential losses.




23 In some sense, aggregating companies with similar characteristics is what credit ratings do. Companies
rated BAA/Baa+ can be quite diverse but all are considered similar with respect to their ability to pay
their debts.

                               As we have described, many risks are measurable, at least on an ex post basis.
                          Market-related risks are blessed with large quantities of data, so they are relatively
                          measurable. Credit, operational, and other risks are somewhat rare events. Although
                          it is probably a good thing that such events are indeed rare, their infrequency makes
                          measurement more difficult. Nonetheless, virtually any risk manager will attempt to
                          obtain at least a subjective sense of the expected frequency, likelihood, and cost of
                          these events. With either objective or subjective measurements in mind, risk managers
                          can then proceed to modify these risks accordingly.




            10            RISK MODIFICATION: PREVENTION, AVOIDANCE,
                          AND ACCEPTANCE

                                           describe methods for measuring and modifying risk exposures and
                                           factors to consider in choosing among the methods

                          The notion of risk modification presumes that an analysis has been conducted in the
                          risk governance stage that defines how much risk is acceptable. Coupled with mea-
                          surements of the actual risk, as discussed in the previous section, the risk manager
                          then proceeds to align the actual risk with the acceptable risk.
                              It is important to understand, however, that risk modification is not strictly risk
                          reduction. For example, a portfolio with the strategic objective of maintaining a
                          50/50 split between equity and cash will naturally find that in a market in which cash
                          outperforms equity, the split between equity and cash will tilt toward cash. Thus,
                          the portfolio becomes less risky. Beyond a certain point, the risk of the portfolio is
                          unacceptably low given the return target. Thus, risk modification would take the form
                          of rebalancing by increasing the risk. For the most part, however, risk management
                          focuses more on reducing the risk. Risk reduction is commonly referred to as hedging.
                          A hedge is a transaction put in place to reduce risk. Some hedges are designed to
                          lead to the ultimate in risk reduction—the complete elimination of risk. Others are
                          simply designed to lower the risk to an acceptable level.24 For some companies, risk
                          management is primarily concerned with keeping the organization solvent. Regardless
                          of the focus, much of what is done to manage risk is the same. In this section, we will
                          examine four broad categories of risk modification: risk prevention and avoidance,
                          risk acceptance, risk transfer, and risk shifting.


                          Risk Prevention and Avoidance
                          One method of managing risk is taking steps to avoid it altogether; however, avoiding
                          risk may not be as simple as it appears. It is difficult to completely avoid risk, but more
                          importantly, it is unclear that every risk should be completely avoided particularly if
                          there are high costs associated with eliminating the risk. Instead we choose a trade-off
                          between cost and benefits. The actual trade-off may be subject to debate because risk
                          assessment and risk management are subject to variation from one person to another.
                              We could nearly eliminate the risk of being injured or killed in an automobile
                          accident if we choose to never drive or ride in a car. Like any risk-avoidance strategy,
                          however, there would more than likely be a trade-off in terms of the loss of the benefits


                          24 For example, in the case of the portfolio with a strategic target of 50/50 equity and cash, if equity out-
                          performs cash, the portfolio will tilt toward equity. At some point, a risk-reducing strategy would then be
                          in order. This type of hedge would reduce the risk but not eliminate it.

provided by the activity. We could try to protect our children from all harm, but that
may come at the expense of preparing them poorly for adult life. We could invest our
entire retirement savings in cash, but would most likely give up protection against
inflation and lose out on the opportunity to benefit from long-term economic growth
and the performance of investable assets that benefit from that growth.
    Insurance companies rely heavily on the techniques of risk prevention and avoid-
ance. An automobile insurance company would prefer that their policyholders never
drive their cars. Although it cannot prohibit them from doing so, it can reward them
with lower premiums if they drive less and have safe driving records. A life insurance
company would prefer that their policyholders do not smoke, and it can reward
non-smokers with lower rates.
    Nearly every risk we take has an upside, at least as perceived by the person taking
the risk. Some counterexamples might seem to belie this point, but not if viewed from
the point of view of the risk taker. One could argue that there are no benefits from
smoking, but people who smoke may have the opinion that the pleasure they receive
exceeds the costs. Casino gambling incurs the risk of significant financial loss and
addiction, but it is risk that is acceptable to the consumers who incur it relative to the
perceived benefits they receive. The risks of extreme sports, such as skydiving, would
seem to be exceeded by the benefits obtained by participants, and yet participants
engage in them with apparently much enjoyment. People undertake all types of risky
behaviors because they obtain commensurate benefits. These examples are simply
cases in which the decision maker chooses to bear a certain degree of risk. They are
conceptually the same as an investor who chooses to accept a relatively high degree
of risk. Likewise, those who live their lives engaging in very few risky activities are
conceptually the same as the investor who keeps only a modest exposure to risky assets.
    In organizations, the decision to avoid risk is generally made at the governance
level as a part of setting the risk tolerance. Boards will often decide that there are some
business or investment activities simply not worth pursuing based on either the goals
of the organization or the perceived risk–return trade-off. These are strategic decisions.
Boards may exclude some areas or activities to allow management to focus on choos-
ing risks in other areas where they presumably have a better chance of adding value.
    We recap this section by noting that risk prevention and avoidance is simply an
element of the decision of how much risk to accept, given the trade-off between the
risk of loss and the benefit of gain. This could be a direct benefit or an indirect benefit
of avoiding or eliminating a risk. Most decisions in life involve a trade-off between
benefits and costs, neither of which is necessarily easy to measure. Thus, risk man-
agement is an ongoing process of fine-tuning exposure to achieve the level of risk that
is desired in relation to the benefits.
    If the risk measurement process shows that the risk exceeds the acceptable level,
there are three approaches to managing the risk: self-insuring, risk transfer, and risk
shifting.


Risk Acceptance: Self-Insurance and Diversification
In many cases, from both a risk tolerance and a strategic standpoint, it makes sense to
keep a risk exposure—but to do so in the most efficient manner possible. Self-insurance
is the notion of bearing a risk that is considered undesirable but too costly to elimi-
nate by external means. In some cases, self-insuring means simply to bear the risk. In
other cases, it may involve the establishment of a reserve to cover losses. Choosing to
not have health insurance can be an optimal choice for some young, healthy adults
without responsibility for children. Setting aside some money to cover potential health
costs completes the picture of an individual who completely self-insures. Similarly, a
young healthy individual who does not buy life insurance but engages in a systematic,
well-conceived savings and investment plan is engaging in self-insurance.

                               One must be careful with this approach, however, because there is a fine line
                          between self-insurance and denial. To the extent that self-insurance results in risks
                          that are completely in line with the enterprise’s risk tolerance, it would be an example
                          of good governance. But if there is a risk that is outside the enterprise’s risk tolerance,
                          and management decides to bear that risk anyway, saying it is self-insuring, manage-
                          ment is basically ignoring that risk, disregarding and violating its risk tolerance, and
                          practicing bad risk governance. For example, an investment management firm, via its
                          risk tolerance decision, may decide that it cannot bear any investment loss exceeding
                          €1 billion and may apply a variety of risk management tools to limit its market and
                          credit risk accordingly. But suppose that the firm makes no move to limit or insure
                          its risks from fraud or a rogue trader on the grounds that it is “self-insuring” this risk,
                          which could result in a loss as high as €3 billion. By leaving itself open to a loss that far
                          exceeds its stated risk tolerance, management is violating the firm’s risk governance.
                               From the perspective of a business organization, self-insurance is obtained by setting
                          aside sufficient capital to cover losses. The banking industry is a classic example of
                          self-insurance. Although in many countries government insurance may protect depos-
                          itors, banks self-insure to some extent by maintaining capital and loan loss reserves.
                               Another form of accepting risk, but doing so in the most efficient manner possible,
                          is diversification. Technically, it is a risk-mitigation technique. But diversification and
                          “the efficient frontier” are so central to modern portfolio analysis that capturing the full
                          benefits of diversification seems the obvious thing for all organizations to pursue—a
                          starting point at which other risk modification could be appended. Although diversi-
                          fication is one form of risk management, it is usually not effective if used in isolation.
                               In the next two subsections, we discuss how undesired risk can be modified or
                          eliminated by selling the risk to another party. We make two subtle classifications of
                          these methods: risk transfer and risk shifting.

                          Risk transfer is the process of passing on a risk to another party, often, but not always,
                          in the form of an insurance policy. Insurance is a legal contract in which one party,
                          the insurer, agrees to cover some percentage of a loss incurred by another party, the
                          insured, from a specific event in return for the payment of a premium by the insured.
                          Insurance as a method of risk modification has been in existence for very long time,
                          and in fact, is even mentioned in the Code of Hammurabi almost 4,000 years ago.
                          Insurance has been widely used in the commercial shipping and farming industries
                          going back hundreds of years. Insurance is almost as old as commerce itself.25
                              From the point of view of the insurer, insurance almost always works on the basis
                          of diversification or pooling of risks. An insurer attempts to sell many policies with
                          risks that have low correlations. The insurer assesses the pooled risks and charges a
                          premium that covers the expected aggregate losses and the insurer’s operating costs


                          25 It is worth noting that the insurance industry has for a long time referred to itself using the term “risk
                          management.” A department of risk management in a large organization is often the group that manages the
                          organization’s insurance policies. But since around 1990 or so, the term “risk management” has increasingly
                          come to refer to far more than insurance.

as well as leaves a profit. Insurers need accurate statistics on aggregate risks, but these
are often not difficult to obtain. These actuarial data are widely available on accidents,
illnesses, property and casualty damage, and death. In principle, a well-diversified
insurer does not care if a single insured party has significantly larger-than-average
claims as long as there is no reason to believe that the claims are correlated. There
will be other parties that have smaller-than-average claims.
    Insurers do have to manage their risks carefully. Some risks can be correlated.
In the US Gulf Coast region, property insurance, which includes coverage for loss
by hurricanes, is typically more expensive than property insurance in other regions.
Even with a higher premium, an insurer has to avoid providing too much property
coverage in an area where a systemic event, such as a hurricane, can occur in order
to diversify its risk exposure.
    Although insurers carefully assess their risk and charge premiums that they believe
accurately reflect expected losses, they nonetheless remain responsible for potentially
large claims. Insurers also manage their risk by avoiding writing too many policies
with similar and potentially correlated risks and by selling some of the risk to another
insurer, a practice known as reinsurance. A company that primarily insures property
in the US Midwest, which is highly subject to tornado risk, might be willing to accept
some Gulf Coast hurricane risk for a reasonable premium. Insurers often write pro-
visions into contracts to exclude coverage of special cases. For example, a war might
nullify insurance coverage in an area. Most insurance policies also contain provisions
to guard against moral hazards, such as suicide or destroying one’s own property. In
the last 20 years or so, some insurance companies have issued bonds that permit them
to legally avoid paying principal and/or interest if insurance claims exceed a certain
amount. These instruments, known as catastrophe bonds, essentially pass some of
the insurance risk on to the investors who buy the bonds.
    Most insurance policies do not cover all of the risk that is insured. It is common
for policies to contain a provision known as a deductible. A deductible is a monetary
amount of the loss that will be covered by the insured before any claims are paid. Thus,
both the insured and the insurer bear some of the risk, although the insurer usually
bears the greater amount. Deductibles serve several purposes. Because insurers incur
fixed costs for each claim, deductibles reduce the number of small claims. Deductibles
also encourage good risk management by the insured parties. Finally, deductibles offer
the insured the opportunity to combine risk transfer with self-insurance and thereby
achieve a potentially better trade-off of risk and reward.
    As noted, the concept of insurance relies on the diversification or pooling of risks.
In a few cases, however, the risks are not easy to pool. For example, suppose a volatile
but extremely successful actor is signed to star in a movie. The production company
knows that it runs the risk that the actor will engage in behavior that damages the
ability of the company to finish the movie. The number of volatile and extremely suc-
cessful actors for whom policies could be written at the same time is somewhat limited.
Thus, an insurer would have to bear that risk without the benefit of diversification.
    For example, suppose a television network plans to cover the Olympics but is con-
cerned about a possible cancellation or boycott. It might want an insurance policy to
cover it against loss. Specialized coverage is possible through such companies as Lloyd’s
of London. The approximately 350-year old Lloyd’s is famous for covering unusual
risks. It does so by organizing groups of investors who are willing to bear a risk for
a premium. These groups, called syndicates, are subject to the full extent of losses.
In many cases, investors in these syndicates have been required to pay substantial
amounts of money to cover losses.26 These examples illustrate how syndicates work.


26 NBC insured the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow through Lloyd’s of London to the extent that if a
US boycott occurred, Lloyd’s would pay NBC for losses that it incurred by prepaying the Soviet Union for
broadcasting rights. The United States did boycott the Olympics and NBC collected on its policy.

                          Although there is only one Olympics to insure, there may also be only one actor to
                          insure. Because the two risks are uncorrelated, a company could write policies on both
                          risks and would achieve some diversification. Moreover, there are other unusual risks
                          that can be covered such that the aggregate pool would represent a highly diverse set
                          of risks that have low correlations.
                              A very slight variation of insurance is a surety bond. With a surety bond, an insurer
                          promises to pay an insured a certain amount of money if a third party fails to fulfill
                          its obligation. For example, if a party engages the services of another party, the first
                          party is covered if the party obligated to provide the service fails to perform to a sat-
                          isfactory degree. Surety bonds are widely used in commercial activity when one party
                          bears the risk of the potentially high cost of non-performance by another party. A
                          slight variation of a surety bond is a fidelity bond, which is often used to cover against
                          losses that result from employee dishonesty. Bonds of this type work very similarly to
                          insurance and rely on the pooling of uncorrelated risks.27 Other similar arrangements
                          include indemnity clauses and hold harmless arrangements, such as when two parties
                          sign a contract and one party agrees to hold the other harmless and/or indemnify the
                          other in the event of loss.
                              The use of insurance by so many as a risk management tool suggests that the cost
                          of risk exceeds the actuarial cost to many individuals and enterprises. Ex ante con-
                          sideration of the cost of a risk in terms of the organization’s value or utility ties risk
                          mitigation back to the risk tolerance decision and the most fundamental governance
                          decisions on which value-added strategies to pursue. As an alternative to ignoring the
                          cost of risk, the impact on enterprise value should be quite positive.


                          Risk Shifting
                          Whereas risk transfer refers to actions taken that pass the risk on to other parties, risk
                          shifting refers to actions that change the distribution of risk outcomes. Risk transfer is
                          often associated with insurance, whereas risk shifting generally involves derivatives as
                          the risk modification vehicle. Although insurance is a form of risk management based
                          on the pooling or diversification of risks, risk shifting diverts some portion of the risk
                          distribution to another market participant who either bears the risk or intermediates
                          that risk by moving it to yet another party. The organization may want to adjust its
                          probability distribution of returns, essentially adjusting the payoff diagram of its risk
                          exposures. An example is a company that is willing to make slightly less profit than it
                          otherwise would if the stock market is up to prevent it from losing too much money
                          if the stock market is down, for example, more than 20% next year. It is adjusting its
                          potential economic outcomes by shifting the probability distribution of its profits
                          conditional on market performance. Risk shifting represents the bulk of hedging and
                          is the most common form of risk modification for financial organizations.
                               The principal device through which risk shifting is performed is a derivative. We
                          briefly mentioned derivatives earlier in this reading. By definition, a derivative is a
                          financial instrument that derives its price from the price of an underlying asset or
                          rate. Because the price of the underlying and the price of the derivative are so closely
                          related, derivatives can provide essentially the same exposure as the underlying but
                          can do so at lower cost and capital requirements. As such, derivatives permit the effi-
                          cient shifting of risk across the probability distribution and from one party to another.
                          One can hold the underlying and take an offsetting position in the derivative or vice
                          versa. Whereas insurance can be designed to perform similarly, insurance functions



                          27 In the context of surety and fidelity bonds, the word “bond” does not mean a debt obligation issued
                          by one party, the borrower, and bought by another, the lender. In this context, the word refers to assuring
                          one party that it bears no risk for the actions of a specific other party.

primarily through the pooling of diverse risks. With derivatives, risks are shifted across
probability distributions or payoffs and across parties, to leave specific outcomes of
the conditional probability distribution with the parties most willing to bear the risk.
    There are several types of derivatives, and the manner in which they provide risk
shifting varies by type. Derivatives are classified into two categories: forward com-
mitments or contingent claims. Forward commitments are agreements that obligate
two parties to undertake a transaction at a future date at a price or rate agreed on
when the commitment is made. Forward commitments include such instruments
as forward contracts, futures contracts, and swaps. Forward commitments can be
used to lock in a future interest rate for a borrower or lender, the purchase or sale
price of an asset, or an exchange rate for a currency. Parties who engage in forward
commitments do not pay any money at the initiation of the contract. In lieu of any
up-front payment from one party to the other, the two parties agree on the terms of
the transaction that will be consummated at the end of the contract. Depending on
movements in the price or rate of the underlying, one party will ultimately gain from
the transaction while the other will lose or, in the less likely case, both parties could
breakeven. For example, a corporate treasurer can use a forward contract to lock in
the rate at which a foreign cash flow will be converted into the company’s domestic
currency. Regardless of movements in the exchange rate during the life of the contract,
the foreign cash flow will convert to the domestic currency at a rate that is locked in
when the contract is initiated. On the opposite side of the transaction, the party can
be a speculator who simply bears the risk, or it can be a dealer who intermediates the
risk between the hedger and the speculator. We will discuss dealers in more detail in
a few paragraphs.

   Risk Shifting: Foreign Exchange Risk and Forward
   Commitments
   You are a UK investor, investing 60% in a UK index fund tracking the FTSE 100,
   the leading index of the UK equity market, and 40% in US Treasuries. You expect
   returns in US dollars on the US Treasuries of 1.6%, and because you expect
   0% return on the USD/GBP exchange rate, this return expectation equals your
   return expectation in sterling. You expect a return of 5.5% on the FTSE 100.
   Hence, the expected return on your portfolio is 3.9%.
      RP = w1 × R1 + (1 – w1) × [(1 + Rlc) × (1 + RFX) – 1].

      RP = 0.6 × 0.055 + 0.4 × [(1 + .015) × (1 + 0.0) – 1] = 0.039 = 3.9%.
       Risk (standard deviation of returns) for the FTSE 100 is 13.2%, and the risk
   on US Treasuries in sterling is 11.0%. Correlations between US Treasuries, the
   FTSE 100, and the USD/GBP exchange rate are shown in the following correla-
   tion matrix.

                                 You have been told that the forward price of a currency expressed in another

                             the forward contract. The current spot price of USD in sterling is GBP0.7040.
                             The one-year forward price is 0.7038, as 12-month deposit rates in the United

                                your US Treasury investment’s value using this one-year forward contract?

                                In a perfect hedge, the impact is the same as ignoring the currency exposure
                                in the US Treasury investment altogether. Filling out the standard deviations
                                and correlations as above in the following formula gives

                                      ​= ​
                                	​σ​p_____________________________________________________________
                                √

                                σp = 0.0757 ≈ 7.6%.
                                This compares to 8.4% risk in the unhedged portfolio, a substantial reduc-
                                tion of risk.

                             2. Does the decision to 100% hedge the foreign exchange exposure have any
                                consequences for the expected return on the hedged portfolio relative to the
                                unhedged portfolio?
                                Solution
                                The forward price of the currency will play a role in the return expected on
                                the hedged portfolio. The forward price of USD in GBP is 0.7038, which is
                                0.03% lower than the spot price today. Because you hedge 40% of current
                                portfolio value, the impact on your expected return is 40% × –0.03%, reduc-
                                ing the hedged portfolio return to 3.87% = 3.9% – 0.03%.

   3. Will the proposed transaction eliminate all currency risk associated with the
      US Treasury investment?
       Solution
       No, unfortunately not. As time progresses, the US Treasury investment will
       fluctuate in value and by the end of the tenor of the forward contract will be
       worth less or more in USD than the amount of USD you have sold. You have
       ended up under- or overhedged. In fact, because you expect the value of
       your investment to increase with your expected return (minus cash distri-
       butions), it is logical to expect to be underhedged. The amount to which you
       are under- or overhedged is subject to currency risk. The risk of being un-
       der- or overhedged can be managed by comparing, at regular intervals, the
       notional value of the forward position with the value of the investment and
       correct the hedge as required. The decision on how often to evaluate this is a
       trade-off between costs (monitoring costs, transaction costs) and risk.

    The other type of derivative is a contingent claim, which is commonly known
as an option. An option is a contract between two parties that gives one party the
right to buy or sell an underlying asset or to pay or receive a known underlying rate.
An option takes the form of either a call option, which provides the right to buy the
underlying or to pay a known rate, or a put option, which provides the right to sell
the underlying or to receive a known rate.
    With a forward commitment, both parties are mutually obligated to each other.
Because an option grants the right, but not the obligation, to one party, that party has
an advantage over the other. Consequently, that party, the buyer of the option, must
pay cash, called the premium, to the seller of the option at the start of the contract.
Once the premium is paid, the option buyer has no further obligation. He can either
exercise the option or he can let the option expire unexercised. In the latter case, the
option buyer incurs a loss equal to the premium. If the option is a call and it is exer-
cised, the buyer pays the fixed price or rate and receives the underlying. If the option
is a put and it is exercised, the buyer receives the fixed price or rate and delivers the
underlying.28 If the buyer of the option does exercise it, he may achieve a gain that
exceeds the premium paid but the gain could also be less than the premium paid,
thereby resulting in a net overall loss. An option buyer could be using the option to
speculate on an upward move in the underlying if a call or downward move if a put.
Alternatively, the option buyer could be hedging. In the example used earlier for for-
ward commitments, the corporate treasurer anticipating an inflow of cash in a foreign
currency could buy a put option to sell that currency, thereby converting it into his
domestic cash flow at a known fixed rate. The option gives the treasurer the flexibility
to not exercise it if the underlying currency rises in value. This flexibility comes at
the cost of having to pay a premium at the start of the transaction, thus shifting the
financial outcome across the entire probability distribution of that uncertain currency
rate. In contrast, with the forward contract, the treasurer does not have to pay cash
at the start but is obligated to convert at the agreed-upon rate.
    Derivatives can be created in public forums, such as on derivatives exchanges, or
privately between two parties. On derivatives exchanges, there are a large number of
individual and institutional traders that make markets in derivatives. For private deriv-
atives transactions, there is an extensive market of large bank and non-bank dealers
willing to buy and sell derivatives. In both types of markets, these dealers assume the
risk of being transferred from parties who originate the transactions. These dealers
almost always restructure and transfer some portion, if not all, of the risk by finding



28 Instead of one party delivering the underlying, some options call for settlement in cash of an equivalent
amount. Some forward commitments also settle in cash.

                          other parties that are willing to take on that risk. Ultimately, the risk is assumed by
                          some party willing to accept the risk, producing an economically efficient outcome
                          for all parties.


                          How to Choose Which Method for Modifying Risk
                          Choosing which risk mitigation method to use—risk prevention and avoidance,
                          self-insuring, risk transfer, or risk shifting—is a critical part of the risk management
                          process. Fortunately, the methods are not mutually exclusive, and many organizations
                          use all methods to some extent. No single method provides a clear-cut advantage over
                          the others. As with all decisions, the trade-off is one of costs versus benefits that are
                          weighed in light of the risk tolerance of the organization or individual.
                               For example, many companies that have extensive foreign operations and are,
                          therefore, highly exposed to exchange rate risk, hedge that risk using derivatives.
                          Some companies prefer forwards, some prefer swaps, some prefer options, and some
                          use multiple instruments. Some companies attempt to hedge currency risk by setting
                          up operations in foreign countries rather than manufacturing domestically and ship-
                          ping the goods to foreign countries.29 Some companies manage their currency risk
                          by attempting to balance currency assets and liabilities. Some airlines hedge the risk
                          of oil price changes and others do not. Some airlines that do hedge this risk do so to
                          a far greater degree than others. Additionally, some prefer the certainty of forwards
                          and swaps, whereas others prefer the flexibility of options, even with the up-front cost
                          that options require. Most insurance companies rely on their actuarial knowledge but
                          supplement it with proactive measures, such as selling risk to other parties.
                               To the extent possible, most organizations should avoid risks that provide few
                          benefits and potentially extreme costs. Reasonable, low-cost precautions against risks
                          with few benefits should always be taken. Thus, risk prevention and risk avoidance
                          are probably the first choice of measures, especially for risks that lie outside the core
                          competencies of the organization and have little reasonable expectation of adding value.
                          Nonetheless, avoidance may not be the best value for its cost. Moreover, avoiding risk
                          may mean avoiding opportunity. Thus, an organization often cannot simply decide
                          not to take a risk, at least not for all undesirable risks.
                               Organizations that have large amounts of free cash flow may choose to self-insure
                          some risks, but few organizations have so much cash that they can afford to self-insure
                          all risks. Some risks can potentially imperil the entire capital base. Most companies
                          would, however, prefer to self-insure to the extent possible because self-insurance
                          reduces the costs associated with external monitoring and gives the organization the
                          greatest flexibility. Self-insurance and avoidance should generally be clearly addressed
                          at the governance level and be consistent with stated risk tolerance.
                               Risk transfer, or the use of insurance, is a widely used risk management tactic, but
                          it may not be suitable for many types of risks. Some risks simply are not insurable, at
                          least not in a cost-effective way. Insurance works best when risks can be pooled, and
                          that is not the case for many types of risks, particularly those that can affect a large
                          number of parties at the same time. The use of risk shifting tools, such as derivatives,
                          may not be available for all types of risks, thus limiting their use in risk mitigation.
                          For financial risks that exceed risk appetite, risk shifting is a very common choice.
                               The various risk management methods are not equal in terms of the risk reduction
                          and the risk profile that remains. For example, contingent claims, such as insurance,
                          provide the flexibility in the form of offering opportunity to profit in one direction


                          29 Here is another example of the interactions of risks. A decision to manufacture products in a foreign
                          country involves trade-offs between exchange rate risk, political risk, and a variety of other risks germane
                          to that country’s economy, not to mention a potentially different degree of operational risk, in the pursuit
                          of higher profits.

and have a loss reduced in the other, but they require payment of cash up front. In
contrast, forward commitments lock in an outcome. In other words, they provide little
flexibility, but they require no cash payment up front. The risk profile that exists when
a contingent claim hedge is put in place differs significantly from the risk profile that
exists when a forward commitment hedge is placed. This process requires significant
understanding and discussion at all levels of the organization.
     To recap, risk takers should identify risks that offer few rewards in light of poten-
tial costs and avoid those risks when possible. They should self-insure where it makes
sense and diversify to the extent possible. They should consider insurance when risks
can be pooled effectively if the cost of the insurance is less than the expected benefit.
If derivatives are used, they must consider the trade-off of locking in outcomes with
forward commitments versus the flexibility relative to cash cost of contingent claims,
which can tailor the desired outcomes or payoffs by shifting the risk. Ultimately, the
decision is always one of balancing costs against benefits while producing a risk profile
that is consistent with the risk management objectives of the organization.

   Measuring and Modifying Risk

   1. From the perspective of an organization, which of the following best de-
      scribes risk drivers?
      A. The probabilities of adverse events
      B. The statistical methods that measure risk
       C. Factors that influence macroeconomies and industries
      Solution
      C is correct. Risks (and risk drivers) arise from fundamental factors in mac-
      roeconomies and industries.

   2. Which of the following concepts directly measures the risk of derivatives?
      A. Probability
      B. Delta and gamma
       C. Beta and standard deviation
      Solution
      B is correct. Delta and gamma are measures of the movement in an option
      price, given a movement in the underlying. The other answers can reflect
      some elements of derivatives risk, but they are not direct measures of the
      risk.

   3. The best definition of value at risk is:
      A. the expected loss if a counterparty defaults.
      B. the maximum loss an organization would expect to incur over a hold-
         ing period.
       C. the minimum loss expected over a holding period a certain percentage
          of the time.
      Solution
      C is correct. VaR measures a minimum loss expected over a holding period
      a certain percentage of the time. It is not an expected loss, nor does it reflect
      the maximum possible loss, which is the entire equity of the organization.

                             4. Which of the following are methods commonly used to supplement VaR to
                                measure the risk of extreme events?
                                  A. Standard deviation
                                  B. Loss given default
                                   C. Scenario analysis and stress testing
                                  Solution
                                  C is correct. Scenario analysis and stress testing both examine the per-
                                  formance of a portfolio subject to extreme events. The other two answers
                                  are metrics used in portfolio analysis but are not typically associated with
                                  extreme events.

                             5. Which of the following is a true statement about insurable risks?
                                  A. Insurable risks are less costly.
                                  B. Insurable risks have smaller loss limits.
                                   C. Insurable risks are typically diversifiable by the insurer.
                                  Solution
                                  C is correct. Insurance works by pooling risks. It is not necessarily less costly
                                  than derivatives nor does it have lower loss limits.




                             SUMMARY
                          Success in business and investing requires the skillful selection and management of
                          risks. A well-developed risk management process ties together an organization’s goals,
                          strategic competencies, and tools to create value to help it both thrive and survive.
                          Good risk management results in better decision making and a keener assessment of
                          the many important trade-offs in business and investing, helping managers maximize
                          value.
                              ■    Risk and risk management are critical to good business and investing. Risk
                                   management is not only about avoiding risk.
                              ■    Taking risk is an active choice by boards and management, investment man-
                                   agers, and individuals. Risks must be understood and carefully chosen and
                                   managed.
                              ■    Risk exposure is the extent to which an organization’s value may be affected
                                   through sensitivity to underlying risks.
                              ■    Risk management is a process that defines risk tolerance and measures,
                                   monitors, and modifies risks to be in line with that tolerance.
                              ■    A risk management framework is the infrastructure, processes, and analytics
                                   needed to support effective risk management; it includes risk governance,
                                   risk identification and measurement, risk infrastructure, risk policies and
                                   processes, risk mitigation and management, communication, and strategic
                                   risk analysis and integration.
                              ■    Risk governance is the top-level foundation for risk management, including
                                   risk oversight and setting risk tolerance for the organization.
                              ■    Risk identification and measurement is the quantitative and qualitative
                                   assessment of all potential sources of risk and the organization’s risk
                                   exposures.

   ■   Risk infrastructure comprises the resources and systems required to track
       and assess the organization’s risk profile.
   ■   Risk policies and processes are management’s complement to risk gover-
       nance at the operating level.
   ■   Risk mitigation and management is the active monitoring and adjusting
       of risk exposures, integrating all the other factors of the risk management
       framework.
   ■   Communication includes risk reporting and active feedback loops so that
       the risk process improves decision making.
   ■   Strategic risk analysis and integration involves using these risk tools to
       rigorously sort out the factors that are and are not adding value as well as
       incorporating this analysis into the management decision process, with the
       intent of improving outcomes.
   ■   Employing a risk management committee, along with a chief risk officer
       (CRO), are hallmarks of a strong risk governance framework.
   ■   Governance and the entire risk process should take an enterprise risk
       management perspective to ensure that the value of the entire enterprise is
       maximized.
   ■   Risk tolerance, a key element of good risk governance, delineates which
       risks are acceptable, which are unacceptable, and how much risk the overall
       organization can be exposed to.
   ■   Risk budgeting is any means of allocating investments or assets by their risk
       characteristics.
   ■   Financial risks are those that arise from activity in the financial markets.
   ■   Non-financial risks arise from actions within an organization or from exter-
       nal origins, such as the environment, the community, regulators, politicians,
       suppliers, and customers.
   ■   Financial risks consist of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
   ■   Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates, exchange
       rates, and commodity prices.
   ■   Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not pay an amount owed.
   ■   Liquidity risk is the risk that, as a result of degradation in market conditions
       or the lack of market participants, one will be unable to sell an asset without
       lowering the price to less than the fundamental value.
   ■   Non-financial risks consist of a variety of risks, including settlement risk,
       legal risk, regulatory risk, accounting risk, tax risk, model risk, tail risk, and
       operational risk.
   ■   Operational risk is the risk that arises either from within the operations of
       an organization or from external events that are beyond the control of the
       organization but affect its operations. Operational risk can be caused by
       employees, the weather and natural disasters, vulnerabilities of IT systems,
       or terrorism.
   ■   Solvency risk is the risk that the organization does not survive or succeed
       because it runs out of cash to meet its financial obligations.
   ■   Individuals face many of the same organizational risks outlined here but also
       face health risk, mortality or longevity risk, and property and casualty risk.
   ■   Risks are not necessarily independent because many risks arise as a result of
       other risks; risk interactions can be extremely non-linear and harmful.

                              ■   Risk drivers are the fundamental global and domestic macroeconomic and
                                  industry factors that create risk.
                              ■   Common measures of risk include standard deviation or volatility;
                                  asset-specific measures, such as beta or duration; derivative measures, such
                                  as delta, gamma, vega, and rho; and tail measures such as value at risk,
                                  CVaR and expected loss given default.
                              ■   Risk can be modified by prevention and avoidance, risk transfer (insurance),
                                  or risk shifting (derivatives).
                              ■   Risk can be mitigated internally through self-insurance or diversification.
                              ■   The primary determinants of which method is best for modifying risk are
                                  the benefits weighed against the costs, with consideration for the overall
                                  final risk profile and adherence to risk governance objectives.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. For individuals, risk management concerns maximizing utility while
                             taking risk consistent with individual’s level of risk tolerance.

                          2. A is correct. Many decision makers focus on return, which is not something that
                             is easily controlled, as opposed to risk, or exposure to risk, which may actually be
                             managed or controlled

                          3. C is correct. Risks need to be defined and measured so as to be consistent with
                             the organization’s chosen level of risk tolerance and target for returns or other
                             outcomes.

                          4. C is correct. While risk infrastructure, which a risk management framework must
                             address, refers to the people and systems required to track risk exposures, there
                             is no requirement to actually name the responsible individuals.

                          5. C is correct. Risk infrastructure refers to the people and systems required to track
                             risk exposures and perform most of the quantitative risk analysis to allow an
                             assessment of the organization’s risk profile. The risk management infrastructure
                             identifies, measures, and monitors risks (among other things).

                          6. A is correct. Risk governance is the top-down process that defines risk tolerance,
                             provides risk oversight and guidance to align risk with enterprise goals.

                          7. C is correct. Risk governance is not about specifying methods to mitigate risk at
                             the business line level. Rather, it is about establishing an appropriate level of risk
                             for the entire enterprise. Specifics of dealing with risk fall under risk management
                             and the risk infrastructure framework.

                          8. A is correct. The risk management committee is a part of the risk governance
                             structure at the operational level—as such, it does not approve the governing
                             body’s policies.

                          9. B is correct. When risk tolerance has been determined, the risk framework
                             should be geared toward measuring, managing, and complying with the risk tol-
                             erance, or aligning risk exposure with risk tolerance. The risk tolerance decision
                             begins by looking at what shortfalls within an organization would cause it to fail
                             to achieve some critical goals and what are the organization’s risk drivers.

                          10. C is correct. If a company has the ability to adapt quickly to adverse events may
                              allow for a higher risk tolerance. There are other factors, such as beliefs of board
                              members and a stable market environment, which may but should not affect risk
                              tolerance.

                          11. A is correct. In establishing a risk management system, determining risk toler-
                              ance must happen before specific risks can be accepted or reduced. Risk toler-
                              ance defines the appetite for risk. Risk budgeting determine how or where the
                              risk is taken and quantifies the tolerable risk by specific metrics. Risk exposures
                              can then be measured and compared against the acceptable risk.

                          12. A is correct. Risk budgeting does not include determining the target return. Risk
                              budgeting quantifies and allocates the tolerable risk by specific metrics.

                          13. A is correct. The process of risk budgeting forces the firm to consider risk
                              tradeoffs. As a result, the firm should choose to invest where the return per unit

Solutions                                                                                   291


   of risk is the highest.

14. A is correct. A financial risk originates from the financial markets. Credit risk is
    one of three financial risks identified in the reading: Credit risk is the chance of
    loss due to an outside party defaulting on an obligation. Solvency risk depends
    at least in part on factors internal to the organization and operational risk is an
    internal risk arising from the people and processes within the organization.

15. B is correct. Liquidity risk is also called transaction cost risk. When the bid–ask
    spread widens, purchase and sale transactions become increasingly costly. The
    risk arises from the uncertainty of the spread.

16. C is correct. Settlement risk is related to default risk but deals with the timing of
    payments rather than the risk of default.

17. A is correct. The VaR measure indicates the probability of a loss of at least a cer-
    tain level in a time period.

18. C is correct. Risk acceptance is similar to self-insurance. An organization choos-
    ing to self-insure may set up a reserve fund to cover losses. Buying insurance is
    a form of risk transfer and using derivatives is a form of risk-shifting, not risk
    acceptance.

19. C is correct. Among the risk-modification methods of risk avoidance, risk accep-
    tance, risk transfer, and risk shifting none has a clear advantage. One must weigh
    benefits and costs in light of the firm’s risk tolerance when choosing the method
    to use.
