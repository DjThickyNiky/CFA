                                   How to Use the CFA
                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.
       The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam
       registration
    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the

       knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use
       the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
       later review.
           Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
       exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
       and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




       ERRATA
       The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
       reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
       errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
       updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
       error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
       reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or
              opportunity costs and explain an interest rate as the sum of a real
              risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing
              distinct types of risk
              calculate and interpret different approaches to return measurement
              over time and describe their appropriate uses
              compare the money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return and
              evaluate the performance of portfolios based on these measures

INTRODUCTION
Interest rates are a critical concept in finance. In some cases, we assume a particular
                                                                                              1
interest rate and in others, the interest rate remains the unknown quantity to deter-
mine. Although the pre-reads have covered the mechanics of time value of money
problems, here we first illustrate the underlying economic concepts by explaining
the meaning and interpretation of interest rates and then calculate, interpret, and
compare different return measures.

                           LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                               ■   An interest rate, r, can have three interpretations: (1) a
                                   required rate of return, (2) a discount rate, or (3) an opportu-
                                   nity cost. An interest rate reflects the relationship between differently
                                   dated cash flows.
                               ■   An interest rate can be viewed as the sum of the real risk-free inter-
                                   est rate and a set of premiums that compensate lenders for bearing
                                   distinct types of risk: an inflation premium, a default risk premium, a
                                   liquidity premium, and a maturity premium.
                               ■   The nominal risk-free interest rate is approximated as the sum of the
                                   real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium.
                               ■   A financial asset’s total return consists of two components: an income
                                   yield consisting of cash dividends or interest payments, and a return
                                   reflecting the capital gain or loss resulting from changes in the price of
                                   the financial asset.
                               ■   A holding period return, R, is the return that an investor earns for a
                                   single, specified period of time (e.g., one day, one month, five years).
                               ■   Multiperiod returns may be calculated across several holding periods
                                   using different return measures (e.g., arithmetic mean, geometric
                                   mean, harmonic mean, trimmed mean, winsorized mean). Each return
                                   computation has special applications for evaluating investments.
                               ■   The choice of which of the various alternative measurements of mean
                                   to use for a given dataset depends on considerations such as the
                                   presence of extreme outliers, outliers that we want to include, whether
                                   there is a symmetric distribution, and compounding.
                               ■   A money-weighted return reflects the actual return earned on an
                                   investment after accounting for the value and timing of cash flows
                                   relating to the investment.
                               ■   A time-weighted return measures the compound rate of growth of one
                                   unit of currency invested in a portfolio during a stated measurement
                                   period. Unlike a money-weighted return, a time-weighted return is not
                                   sensitive to the timing and amount of cashflows and is the preferred
                                   performance measure for evaluating portfolio managers because cash
                                   withdrawals or additions to the portfolio are generally outside of the
                                   control of the portfolio manager.
                               ■   Interest may be paid or received more frequently than annually. The
                                   periodic interest rate and the corresponding number of compounding
                                   periods (e.g., quarterly, monthly, daily) should be adjusted to compute
                                   present and future values.
                               ■   Annualizing periodic returns allows investors to compare different
                                   investments across different holding periods to better evaluate and
                                   compare their relative performance. With the number of compound-
                                   ing periods per year approaching infinity, the interest is compound
                                   continuously.
                               ■   Gross return, return prior to deduction of managerial and adminis-
                                   trative expenses (those expenses not directly related to return gener-
                                   ation), is an appropriate measure to evaluate the comparative perfor-
                                   mance of an asset manager.

INTEREST RATES AND TIME VALUE OF MONEY
                                                                                           2
              interpret interest rates as required rates of return, discount rates, or
              opportunity costs and explain an interest rate as the sum of a real
              risk-free rate and premiums that compensate investors for bearing
              distinct types of risk

The time value of money establishes the equivalence between cash flows occurring on
different dates. As cash received today is preferred to cash promised in the future, we
must establish a consistent basis for this trade-off to compare financial instruments in
cases in which cash is paid or received at different times. An interest rate (or yield),
denoted r, is a rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated
– timed – cash flows. If USD 9,500 today and USD 10,000 in one year are equivalent
in value, then USD 10,000 – USD 9,500 = USD 500 is the required compensation for
receiving USD 10,000 in one year rather than now. The interest rate (i.e., the required
compensation stated as a rate of return) is USD 500/USD 9,500 = 0.0526 or 5.26 percent.
    Interest rates can be thought of in three ways:
   ■   First, they can be considered required rates of return—that is, the minimum
       rate of return an investor must receive to accept an investment.
   ■   Second, interest rates can be considered discount rates. In the previous
       example, 5.26 percent is the discount rate at which USD 10,000 in one year
       is equivalent to USD 9,500 today. Thus, we use the terms “interest rate” and
       “discount rate” almost interchangeably.
   ■   Third, interest rates can be considered opportunity costs. An opportunity
       cost is the value that investors forgo by choosing a course of action. In the
       example, if the party who supplied USD 9,500 had instead decided to spend
       it today, he would have forgone earning 5.26 percent by consuming rather
       than saving. So, we can view 5.26 percent as the opportunity cost of current
       consumption.

                        Determinants of Interest Rates
                        Economics tells us that interest rates are set by the forces of supply and demand, where
                        investors supply funds and borrowers demand their use. Taking the perspective of
                        investors in analyzing market-determined interest rates, we can view an interest rate
                        r as being composed of a real risk-free interest rate plus a set of premiums that are
                        required returns or compensation for bearing distinct types of risk:

                            r = Real risk-free interest rate + Inflation premium + Default risk premium +
                                Liquidity premium + Maturity premium. (1)

                            ■   The real risk-free interest rate is the single-period interest rate for a com-
                                pletely risk-free security if no inflation were expected. In economic theory,
                                the real risk-free rate reflects the time preferences of individuals for current
                                versus future real consumption.
                            ■   The inflation premium compensates investors for expected inflation and
                                reflects the average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt.
                                Inflation reduces the purchasing power of a unit of currency—the amount
                                of goods and services one can buy with it.
                            ■   The default risk premium compensates investors for the possibility that the
                                borrower will fail to make a promised payment at the contracted time and in
                                the contracted amount.
                            ■   The liquidity premium compensates investors for the risk of loss relative
                                to an investment’s fair value if the investment needs to be converted to
                                cash quickly. US Treasury bills (T-bills), for example, do not bear a liquidity
                                premium because large amounts of them can be bought and sold without
                                affecting their market price. Many bonds of small issuers, by contrast, trade
                                infrequently after they are issued; the interest rate on such bonds includes a
                                liquidity premium reflecting the relatively high costs (including the impact
                                on price) of selling a position.
                            ■   The maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity
                                of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity
                                is extended, in general (holding all else equal). The difference between the
                                interest rate on longer-maturity, liquid Treasury debt and that on short-term
                                Treasury debt typically reflects a positive maturity premium for the
                                longer-term debt (and possibly different inflation premiums as well).
                            The sum of the real risk-free interest rate and the inflation premium is the nominal
                        risk-free interest rate:
                            The nominal risk-free interest rate reflects the combination of a real risk-free rate
                        plus an inflation premium:

                            (1 + nominal risk-free rate) = (1 + real risk-free rate)(1 + inflation premium).
                            In practice, however, the nominal rate is often approximated as the sum of the
                        real risk-free rate plus an inflation premium:

                            Nominal risk-free rate = Real risk-free rate + inflation premium.
                            Many countries have short-term government debt whose interest rate can be
                        considered to represent the nominal risk-free interest rate over that time horizon in
                        that country. The French government issues BTFs, or negotiable fixed-rate discount
                        Treasury bills (Bons du Trésor à taux fixe et à intérêts précomptés), with maturities
                        of up to one year. The Japanese government issues a short-term Treasury bill with
                        maturities of 6 and 12 months. The interest rate on a 90-day US T-bill, for example,
                        represents the nominal risk-free interest rate for the United States over the next three

Interest Rates and Time Value of Money                                                           7


months. Typically, interest rates are quoted in annual terms, so the interest rate on a
90-day government debt security quoted at 3 percent is the annualized rate and not
the actual interest rate earned over the 90-day period.
     Whether the interest rate we use is a required rate of return, or a discount rate,
or an opportunity cost, the rate encompasses the real risk-free rate and a set of risk
premia that depend on the characteristics of the cash flows. The foundational set of
premia consist of inflation, default risk, liquidity risk, and maturity risk. All these premia
vary over time and continuously change, as does the real risk-free rate. Consequently,
all interest rates fluctuate, but how much they change depends on various economic
fundamentals—and on the expectation of how these various economic fundamentals
can change in the future.

        Based on the information in Exhibit 1, address the following:

   1. Explain the difference between the interest rates offered by Investment 1
      and Investment 2.
        Solution:
        Investment 2 is identical to Investment 1 except that Investment 2 has low
        liquidity. The difference between the interest rate on Investment 2 and In-
        vestment 1 is 0.5 percent. This difference in the two interest rates represents
        a liquidity premium, which represents compensation for the lower liquidity
        of Investment 2 (the risk of loss relative to an investment’s fair value if the
        investment needs to be converted to cash quickly).

   2. Estimate the default risk premium affecting all securities.
        Solution:
        To estimate the default risk premium, identify two investments that have the
        same maturity but different levels of default risk. Investments 4 and 5 both
        have a maturity of eight years but different levels of default risk. Investment
        5, however, has low liquidity and thus bears a liquidity premium relative to
        Investment 4. From Part A, we know the liquidity premium is 0.5 percent.
        The difference between the interest rates offered by Investments 5 and 4 is
        2.5 percent (6.5% − 4.0%), of which 0.5 percent is a liquidity premium. This

                              implies that 2.0 percent (2.5% − 0.5%) must represent a default risk premium
                              reflecting Investment 5’s relatively higher default risk.

                           3. Calculate upper and lower limits for the unknown interest rate for Invest-
                              ment 3, r3.
                              Solution:
                              Investment 3 has liquidity risk and default risk comparable to Investment 2,
                              but with its longer time to maturity, Investment 3 should have a higher ma-
                              turity premium and offer a higher interest rate than Investment 2. Therefore,
                              the interest rate on Investment 3, r3, should thus be above 2.5 percent (the
                              interest rate on Investment 2).
                              If the liquidity of Investment 3 was high, Investment 3 would match Invest-
                              ment 4 except for Investment 3’s shorter maturity. We would then conclude
                              that Investment 3’s interest rate should be less than the interest rate offered
                              by Investment 4, which is 4 percent. In contrast to Investment 4, however,
                              Investment 3 has low liquidity. It is possible that the interest rate on Invest-
                              ment 3 exceeds that of Investment 4 despite Investment 3’s shorter maturity,
                              depending on the relative size of the liquidity and maturity premiums. How-
                              ever, we would expect r3 to be less than 4.5 percent, the expected interest
                              rate on Investment 4 if it had low liquidity (4% + 0.5%, the liquidity premi-
                              um). Thus, we should expect in the interest rate offered by Investment 3 to
                              be between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent.




            3           RATES OF RETURN

                                      calculate and interpret different approaches to return measurement
                                      over time and describe their appropriate uses

                        Financial assets are frequently defined in terms of their return and risk characteristics.
                        Comparison along these two dimensions simplifies the process of building a portfolio
                        from among all available assets. In this lesson, we will compute, evaluate, and compare
                        various measures of return.
                            Financial assets normally generate two types of return for investors. First, they
                        may provide periodic income through cash dividends or interest payments. Second,
                        the price of a financial asset can increase or decrease, leading to a capital gain or loss.
                            Some financial assets provide return through only one of these mechanisms. For
                        example, investors in non-dividend-paying stocks obtain their return from price
                        movement only. Other assets only generate periodic income. For example, defined
                        benefit pension plans and retirement annuities make income payments over the life
                        of a beneficiary.


                        Holding Period Return
                        Returns can be measured over a single period or over multiple periods. Single-period
                        returns are straightforward because there is only one way to calculate them.
                        Multiple-period returns, however, can be calculated in various ways and it is important
                        to be aware of these differences to avoid confusion.

Rates of Return                                                                                                9


    A holding period return, R, is the return earned from holding an asset for a single
specified period of time. The period may be one day, one week, one month, five years,
or any specified period. If the asset (e.g., bond, stock) is purchased today, time (t = 0),
at a price of 100 and sold later, say at time (t = 1), at a price of 105 with no dividends
or other income, then the holding period return is 5 percent [(105 − 100)/100)]. If the
asset also pays income of two units at time (t = 1), then the total return is 7 percent.
This return can be generalized and shown as a mathematical expression in which P
is the price and I is the income, as follows:
          _(​ ​P1​  ​​ − ​P0​  ​​)​ + ​I1​  ​​
    	​R = ​             ​P​   ​​
                              ​​               ,                                                      (1)
                               0

    where the subscript indicates the time of the price or income; (t = 0) is the begin-
ning of the period; and (t = 1) is the end of the period. The following two observations
are important.
    ■       We computed a capital gain of 5 percent and an income yield of 2 per-
            cent in this example. For ease of illustration, we assumed that the income
            is paid at time t = 1. If the income was received before t = 1, our holding
            period return may have been higher if we had reinvested the income for the
            remainder of the period.
    ■       Return can be expressed in decimals (0.07), fractions (7/100), or as a percent
            (7 percent). They are all equivalent.
    A holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year. For
example, an analyst may need to compute a one-year holding period return from
three annual returns. In that case, the one-year holding period return is computed
by compounding the three annual returns:
    R = [(1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × (1 + R3)] − 1,
    where R1, R2, and R3 are the three annual returns.


Arithmetic or Mean Return
Most holding period returns are reported as daily, monthly, or annual returns. When
assets have returns for multiple holding periods, it is necessary to normalize returns
to a common period for ease of comparison and understanding. There are different
methods for aggregating returns across several holding periods. The remainder of
this section presents various ways of computing average returns and discusses their
applicability.
    The simplest way to compute a summary measure for returns across multiple
periods is to take a simple arithmetic average of the holding period returns. Thus,
three annual returns of −50 percent, 35 percent, and 27 percent will give us an average
of 4 percent per year = ​​(

compute and has known statistical properties.                                                      _

                         Geometric Mean Return
                         The arithmetic mean return assumes that the amount invested at the beginning of each
                         period is the same. In an investment portfolio, however, even if there are no cash flows
                         into or out of the portfolio the base amount changes each year. The previous year’s
                         earnings must be added to the beginning value of the subsequent year’s investment—
                         these earnings will be “compounded” by the returns earned in that subsequent year.
                         We can use the geometric mean return to account for the compounding of returns.
                             A geometric mean return provides a more accurate representation of the growth in
                         portfolio value over a given time period than                           _ the arithmetic mean return. In general,
                         the geometric mean return is denoted by ​​​ R ​​  Gi​​​and given by the following equation

                         4.00 percent. Using Equation 4, we can calculate the geometric mean return from the
                         same three annual returns:

                         Beginning with an initial investment of EUR1.0000, we will have a balance of EUR0.8573
                         at the end of the three-year period as shown in the fourth column of Exhibit 2. Note
                         that we compounded the returns because, unless otherwise stated, we earn a return
                         on the balance as of the end of the prior year. That is, we will receive a return of 35
                         percent in the second year on the balance at the end of the first year, which is only
                         EUR0.5000, not the initial balance of EUR1.0000. Let us compare the balance at the
                         end of the three-year period computed using geometric returns with the balance we
                         would calculate using the 4 percent annual arithmetic mean return from our earlier
                         example. The ending value using the arithmetic mean return is EUR1.1249 (=1.0000 ×
                         1.043). This is much larger than the actual balance at the end of Year 3 of EUR0.8573.
                             In general, the arithmetic return is biased upward unless each of the underlying
                         holding period returns are equal. The bias in arithmetic mean returns is particularly
                         severe if holding period returns are a mix of both positive and negative returns, as
                         in this example.
                             We will now look at three examples that calculate holding period returns over
                         different time horizons.

EXAMPLE 2

   Holding Period Return

   1. An investor purchased 100 shares of a stock for USD34.50 per share at the
      beginning of the quarter. If the investor sold all of the shares for USD30.50
      per share after receiving a USD51.55 dividend payment at the end of the
      quarter, the investor’s holding period return is closest to:
      A. −13.0 percent.
      B. −11.6 percent.
       C. −10.1 percent.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Applying Equation 2, the holding period return is −10.1 per-
      cent, calculated as follows:
      R = (3,050 − 3,450 + 51.55)/3,450 = −10.1%.
      The holding period return comprised of a dividend yield of 1.49 percent (=
      51.55/3,450) and a capital loss of −11.59 percent (= −400/3,450).

      The fund’s holding period return over the three-year period is closest to:
      A. 0.18 percent.
      B. 0.55 percent.
       C. 0.67 percent.
      Solution:
      B is correct. The fund’s three-year holding period return is 0.55 percent,
      calculated as follows:
      R = [(1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × (1 + R3)] − 1,

      R = [(1 + 0.14)(1 − 0.10)(1 − 0.02)] − 1 = 0.0055 = 0.55%.

    In Example 5, the geometric mean return is less than the arithmetic mean return
for each country’s index returns. In fact, the geometric mean is always less than or
equal to the arithmetic mean with one exception: the two means will be equal is when
there is no variability in the observations—that is, when all the observations in the
series are the same.
    In general, the difference between the arithmetic and geometric means increases
with the variability within the sample; the more disperse the observations, the greater
the difference between the arithmetic and geometric means. Casual inspection of the
returns in Exhibit 5 and the associated graph of means in Exhibit 6 suggests a greater
variability for Country A’s index relative to the other indexes, and this is confirmed
with the greater deviation of the geometric mean return (−5.38 percent) from the
arithmetic mean return (−4.97 percent). How should the analyst interpret these results?

                         The geometric mean return represents the growth rate or compound rate of return on
                         an investment. One unit of currency invested in a fund tracking the Country B index
                         at the beginning of Year 1 would have grown to (1.078)(1.063)(0.985) = 1.128725 units
                         of currency, which is equal to 1 plus Country B’s geometric mean return of 4.1189 per-
                         cent compounded over three periods: [1 + 0.041189]3 = 1.128725. This math confirms
                         that the geometric mean is the compound rate of return. With its focus on the actual
                         return of an investment over a multiple-period horizon, the geometric mean is of key
                         interest to investors. The arithmetic mean return, focusing on average single-period
                         performance, is also of interest. Both arithmetic and geometric means have a role to
                         play in investment management, and both are often reported for return series.
                             For reporting historical returns, the geometric mean has considerable appeal
                         because it is the rate of growth or return we would have to earn each year to match
                         the actual, cumulative investment performance. Suppose we purchased a stock for
                         EUR100 and two years later it was worth EUR100, with an intervening year at EUR200.
                         The geometric mean of 0 percent is clearly the compound rate of growth during the
                         two years, which we can confirm by compounding the returns: [(1 + 1.00)(1 − 0.50)]1/2
                         − 1 = 0%. Specifically, the ending amount is the beginning amount times (1 + RG)2.
                             However, the arithmetic mean, which is [100% + −50%]/2 = 25% in the previous
                         example, can distort our assessment of historical performance. As we noted, the
                         arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean. If we want to
                         estimate the average return over a one-period horizon, we should use the arithmetic
                         mean because the arithmetic mean is the average of one-period returns. If we want
                         to estimate the average returns over more than one period, however, we should use
                         the geometric mean of returns because the geometric mean captures how the total
                         returns are linked over time.


                         The Harmonic Mean

                         The harmonic mean, ​​​ X ​​  H​​​, is another measure of central tendency. The harmonic
                         mean is appropriate in cases in which the variable is a rate or a ratio. The terminology
                         “harmonic” arises from its use of a type of series involving reciprocals known as a
                         harmonic series.

   Harmonic Mean Formula. The harmonic mean of a set of observations X1, X2,
…, Xn is:
        _
   	​​​ X ​​  H​​  = ​ _
                           n
                        n                 ​​,                         (4)
                       ​∑​(1 / ​Xi​  )​​ ​
                       i=1

   with Xi > 0 for i = 1, 2, …, n.
   The harmonic mean is the value obtained by summing the reciprocals of the
observations,
            n
   	​​∑           ​  (1 / ​Xi​  ​​)​​,
            i=1

  the terms of the form 1/Xi, and then averaging their sum by dividing it by the
number of observations, n, and, then finally, taking the reciprocal of that average,

   ​∑​(1 / ​Xi​  ​​)​

The harmonic mean may be viewed as a special type of weighted mean in which an
observation’s weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude. For example, if there
is a sample of observations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 1,000, the harmonic mean is 2.8560.
Compared to the arithmetic mean of 145.8571, we see the influence of the outlier (the
1,000) to be much less than in the case of the arithmetic mean. So, the harmonic mean
is quite useful as a measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.
     The harmonic mean is used most often when the data consist of rates and ratios,
such as P/Es. Suppose three peer companies have P/Es of 45, 15, and 15. The arithmetic
mean is 25, but the harmonic mean, which gives less weight to the P/E of 45, is 19.3.
     The harmonic mean is a relatively specialized concept of the mean that is appro-
priate for averaging ratios (“amount per unit”) when the ratios are repeatedly applied
to a fixed quantity to yield a variable number of units. The concept is best explained
through an illustration. A well-known application arises in the investment strategy
known as cost averaging, which involves the periodic investment of a fixed amount
of money. In this application, the ratios we are averaging are prices per share at
different purchase dates, and we are applying those prices to a constant amount of
money to yield a variable number of shares. An illustration of the harmonic mean to
cost averaging is provided in Example 6.

EXAMPLE 6

   Cost Averaging and the Harmonic Mean

   1. Suppose an investor invests EUR1,000 each month in a particular stock for
      n = 2 months. The share prices are EUR10 and EUR15 at the two purchase
      dates. What was the average price paid for the security?
            Solution:
            Purchase in the first month = EUR1,000/EUR10 = 100 shares.

            Purchase in the second month = EUR1,000/EUR15 = 66.67 shares.
            The investor purchased a total of 166.67 shares for EUR2,000, so the average
            price paid per share is EUR2,000/166.67 = EUR12.
            The average price paid is in fact the harmonic mean of the asset’s prices at
            the purchase dates. Using Equation 5, the harmonic mean price is 2/[(1/10)
            + (1/15)] = EUR12. The value EUR12 is less than the arithmetic mean pur-
            chase price (EUR10 + EUR15)/2 = EUR12.5.

                             Because they use the same data but involve different progressions in their respec-
                         tive calculations, the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means are mathematically
                         related to one another. We will not go into the proof of this relationship, but the basic
                         result follows:
                             Arithmetic mean × Harmonic mean = (Geometric mean)2.
                         Unless all the observations in a dataset are the same value, the harmonic mean is always
                         less than the geometric mean, which, in turn, is always less than the arithmetic mean.
                             The harmonic mean only works for non-negative numbers, so when working with
                         returns that are expressed as positive or negative percentages, we first convert the
                         returns into a compounding format, assuming a reinvestment, as (1 + R), as was done
                         in the geometric mean return calculation, and then calculate (1 + harmonic mean),
                         and subtract 1 to arrive at the harmonic mean return.

        In finance, the weighted harmonic mean is used when averaging rates and
        other multiples, such as the P/E ratio, because the harmonic mean gives
        equal weight to each data point, and reduces the influence of outliers.
        These calculations can be performed using Excel:

         ■        To calculate the arithmetic mean or average return, the
                  =AVERAGE(return1, return2, … ) function can be used.
         ■        To calculate the geometric mean return, the =GEOMEAN(return1,
                  return2, … ) function can be used.
         ■        To calculate the harmonic mean return, the =HARMEAN(return1,
                  return2, … ) function can be used.

    In addition to arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means, two other types of
means can be used. Both the trimmed and the winsorized means seek to minimize
the impact of outliers in a dataset. Specifically, the trimmed mean removes a small
defined percentage of the largest and smallest values from a dataset containing our
observation before calculating the mean by averaging the remaining observations.
    A winsorized mean replaces the extreme observations in a dataset to limit the
effect of the outliers on the calculations. The winsorized mean is calculated after
replacing extreme values at both ends with the values of their nearest observations,
and then calculating the mean by averaging the remaining observations.
    However, the key question is: Which mean to use in what circumstances? The
choice of which mean to use depends on many factors, as we describe in Exhibit 8:
   ■      Are there outliers that we want to include?
   ■      Is the distribution symmetric?
   ■      Is there compounding?
   ■      Are there extreme outliers?

MONEY-WEIGHTED AND TIME-WEIGHTED RETURN
                                                                                                    4
               compare the money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return and
               evaluate the performance of portfolios based on these measures

The arithmetic and geometric return computations do not account for the timing of
cash flows into and out of a portfolio. For example, suppose an investor experiences
the returns shown in Exhibit 2. Instead of only investing EUR1.0 at the start (Year
0) as was the case in Exhibit 2, suppose the investor had invested EUR10,000 at the
start, EUR1,000 in Year 1, and EUR1,000 in Year 2. In that case, the return of –50
percent in Year 1 significantly hurts her given the relatively large investment at the
start. Conversely, if she had invested only EUR100 at the start, the absolute effect of
the –50 percent return on the total return is drastically reduced.


Calculating the Money Weighted Return
The money-weighted return accounts for the money invested and provides the
investor with information on the actual return she earns on her investment. The
money-weighted return and its calculation are similar to the internal rate of return
and a bond’s yield to maturity. Amounts invested are cash outflows from the investor’s
perspective and amounts returned or withdrawn by the investor, or the money that
remains at the end of an investment cycle, is a cash inflow for the investor.
    For example, assume that an investor invests EUR100 in a mutual fund at the
beginning of the first year, adds another EUR950 at the beginning of the second year,
and withdraws EUR350 at the end of the second year. The cash flows are presented
in Exhibit 10.

                         The internal rate of return is the discount rate at which the sum of present values
                         of cash flows will equal zero. In general, the equation may be expressed as follows:
                                        T _       C ​Ft​  ​​
                               	​  ​∑      ​​ ​              t ​  = 0​,                                                                                                 (5)
                                        t=0 (​​ 1 + IRR)​​​  ​

                         where T is the number of periods, CFt is the cash flow at time t, and IRR is the internal
                         rate of return or the money-weighted rate of return.
                              A cash flow can be positive or negative; a positive cash flow is an inflow where
                         money flows to the investor, whereas a negative cash flow is an outflow where money
                         flows away from the investor. The cash flows are expressed as follows, where each cash
                         inflow or outflow occurs at the end of each year. Thus, CF0 refers to the cash flow at
                         the end of Year 0 or beginning of Year 1, and CF3 refers to the cash flow at end of Year
                         3 or beginning of Year 4. Because cash flows are being discounted to the present—that
                         is, end of Year 0 or beginning of Year 1—the period of discounting CF0 is zero.

                         entire period on an annualized basis. This return is much greater than the arithmetic
                         and geometric mean returns because only a small amount was invested when the
                         mutual fund’s return was −50 percent.
                             All the above calculations can be performed using Excel using the =IRR(values)

                         Money-Weighted Return for a Dividend-Paying Stock
                         Next, we’ll illustrate calculating the money-weighted return for a dividend paying
                         stock. Consider an investment that covers a two-year horizon. At time t = 0, an inves-
                         tor buys one share at a price of USD200. At time t = 1, he purchases an additional
                         share at a price of USD225. At the end of Year 2, t = 2, he sells both shares at a price
                         of USD235. During both years, the stock pays a dividend of USD5 per share. The t
                         =1 dividend is not reinvested. Exhibit 11 outlines the total cash inflows and outflows
                         for the investment.

Time                      Outflows

0                         USD200 to purchase the first share
1                         USD225 to purchase the second share

Time                      Inflows

1                         USD5 dividend received from first share (and not reinvested)
2                         USD10 dividend (USD5 per share × 2 shares) received
2                         USD470 received from selling two shares at USD235 per share

To solve for the money-weighted return, the first step is to group net cash flows by
time. For this example, we have −USD200 for the t = 0 net cash flow, −USD220 = −
USD225 + USD5 for the t = 1 net cash flow, and USD480 for the t = 2 net cash flow.
After entering these cash flows, we use the spreadsheet’s (such as Excel) or calculator’s
IRR function to find that the money-weighted rate of return is 9.39 percent.

    IRR = 9.39%
All these calculations can be performed using Excel using the =IRR(values) function,
which results in an IRR of 9.39 percent.
    Now we take a closer look at what has happened to the portfolio during each of
the two years.
    In the first year, the portfolio generated a one-period holding period return of
(USD5 + USD225 − USD200)/USD200 = 15%. At the beginning of the second year,
the amount invested is USD450, calculated as USD225 (per share price of stock) × 2
shares, because the USD5 dividend was spent rather than reinvested.
    At the end of the second year, the proceeds from the liquidation of the portfolio
are USD470 plus USD10 in dividends (as outlined in Exhibit 11). So, in the second
year the portfolio produced a holding period return of (USD10 + USD470 − USD450)/
USD450 = 6.67%. The mean holding period return was (15% + 6.67%)/2 = 10.84%.
    The money-weighted rate of return, which we calculated as 9.39 percent, puts a
greater weight on the second year’s relatively poor performance (6.67 percent) than
the first year’s relatively good performance (15 percent), as more money was invested
in the second year than in the first. That is the sense in which returns in this method
of calculating performance are “money weighted.”
    Although the money-weighted return is an accurate measure of what the investor
earned on the money invested, it is limited in its applicability to other situations.
For example, it does not allow for a return comparison between different individ-
uals or different investment opportunities. Importantly, two investors in the same
mutual fund or with the same portfolio of underlying investments may have different
money-weighted returns because they invested different amounts in different years.

   2. Compute the fund’ s arithmetic mean annual return.
      Solution:
      The arithmetic mean annual return is calculated as:
            _              15 %  − 5 %  + 10 %  + 15 %  + 3%
       	​​​ R ​​  i​​  = ​ ________________________
                                           5  
                                              ​  = 7.60%​.


   3. Compute the fund’s geometric mean annual return. How does it compare
      with the arithmetic mean annual return?
      Solution:
      The geometric mean annual return can be computed as:
            _              5
                             ___________________________
       	​​​ R ​​  Gi​​  = ​ √ 1.15
                                   × 0.95 × 1.10 × 1.15 × 1.03 ​ − 1,​
           _              5
                            _
      	​​​ R ​​  Gi​​  = ​ √ 1.4235 ​ − 1 = 0.0732 = 7.32%​.
      Thus, the geometric mean annual return is 7.32 percent, which is slightly
      less than the arithmetic mean return of 7.60 percent.

   4. The Lohrmanns want to earn a minimum annual return of 5 percent. The
      annual returns and investment amounts are presented in Exhibit 13. Is the
      money-weighted annual return greater than 5 percent?
      Solution:
      To calculate the money-weighted rate of return, tabulate the annual returns
      and investment amounts to determine the cash flows, as shown in Exhibit
      13:
      CF0 = –30.00, CF1 = –10.50, CF2 = +22.75, CF3 = –3.00, CF4 = –6.25, CF5
      = +36.05.
      We can use the given 5 percent return to see whether or not the present val-
      ue of the net cash flows is positive. If it is positive, then the money-weighted
      rate of return is greater than 5 percent, because a 5 percent discount rate
      could not reduce the present value to zero.
      _      − 30.00 _            − 10.50 _       22.75          − 3.00       − 6.25          36.05
      	​​  (              ​  + ​          ​  + ​          ​  + ​ _ ​  + ​ _ ​  + ​ _ ​  = 1.1471​.
           ​​ 1.05)​​​  0​ ​​(1.05)​​​  1​ ​​(1.05)​​​  2​ ​​(1.05)​​​  3​ ​​(1.05)​​​  4​ ​​(1.05)​​​  5​
      Because the value is positive, the money-weighted rate of return is greater
      than 5 percent. The exact money-weighted rate of return (found by setting
      the above equation equal to zero) is 5.86 percent.
      These calculations can be performed using Excel using the =IRR(cash flows)
      function, which results in an IRR of 5.86 percent.


Time-Weighted Returns
An investment measure that is not sensitive to the additions and withdrawals of funds
is the time-weighted rate of return. The time-weighted rate of return measures the
compound rate of growth of USD1 initially invested in the portfolio over a stated
measurement period. For the evaluation of portfolios of publicly traded securities, the
time-weighted rate of return is the preferred performance measure as it neutralizes
the effect of cash withdrawals or additions to the portfolio, which are generally outside
of the control of the portfolio manager.

                         Computing Time-Weighted Returns
                         To compute an exact time-weighted rate of return on a portfolio, take the following
                         three steps:
                             1. Price the portfolio immediately prior to any significant addition or with-
                                drawal of funds. Break the overall evaluation period into subperiods based
                                on the dates of cash inflows and outflows.
                             2. Calculate the holding period return on the portfolio for each subperiod.
                             3. Link or compound holding period returns to obtain an annual rate of return
                                for the year (the time-weighted rate of return for the year). If the investment
                                is for more than one year, take the geometric mean of the annual returns to
                                obtain the time-weighted rate of return over that measurement period.
                             Let us return to our dividend stock money-weighted example in the section,
                         “Money-Weighted Return for a Dividend-Paying Stock” and calculate the time-weighted
                         rate of return for that investor’s portfolio based on the information included in Exhibit
                         11. In that example, we computed the holding period returns on the portfolio, Step
                         2 in the procedure for finding the time-weighted rate of return. Given that the port-
                         folio earned returns of 15 percent during the first year and 6.67 percent during the
                         second year, what is the portfolio’s time-weighted rate of return over an evaluation
                         period of two years?
                             We find this time-weighted return by taking the geometric mean of the two holding
                         period returns, Step 3 in the previous procedure. The calculation of the geometric
                         mean exactly mirrors the calculation of a compound growth rate. Here, we take the
                         product of 1 plus the holding period return for each period to find the terminal value
                         at t = 2 of USD1 invested at t = 0. We then take the square root of this product and
                         subtract 1 to get the geometric mean return. We interpret the result as the annual
                         compound growth rate of USD1 invested in the portfolio at t = 0. Thus, we have:

                                                                  (1.15)​​(1.0667)​

                         The time-weighted return on the portfolio was 10.76 percent, compared with the
                         money-weighted return of 9.39 percent, which gave larger weight to the second year’s
                         return. We can see why investment managers find time-weighted returns more mean-
                         ingful. If a client gives an investment manager more funds to invest at an unfavorable
                         time, the manager’s money-weighted rate of return will tend to be depressed. If a client
                         adds funds at a favorable time, the money-weighted return will tend to be elevated.
                         The time-weighted rate of return removes these effects.
                             In defining the steps to calculate an exact time-weighted rate of return, we said
                         that the portfolio should be valued immediately prior to any significant addition or
                         withdrawal of funds. With the amount of cash flow activity in many portfolios, this task
                         can be costly. We can often obtain a reasonable approximation of the time-weighted
                         rate of return by valuing the portfolio at frequent, regular intervals, particularly if
                         additions and withdrawals are unrelated to market movements.
                             The more frequent the valuation, the more accurate the approximation. Daily
                         valuation is commonplace. Suppose that a portfolio is valued daily over the course
                         of a year. To compute the time-weighted return for the year, we first compute each
                         day’s holding period return. We compute 365 such daily returns, denoted R1, R2, …,
                         R365. We obtain the annual return for the year by linking the daily holding period
                         returns in the following way: (1 + R1) × (1 + R2) × … × (1 + R365) − 1. If withdrawals
                         and additions to the portfolio happen only at day’s end, this annual return is a precise
                         time-weighted rate of return for the year. Otherwise, it is an approximate time-weighted
                         return for the year.

   If we have several years of data, we can calculate a time-weighted return for each
year individually, as above. If Ri is the time-weighted return for year i, we calculate an
annualized time-weighted return as the geometric mean of N annual returns, as follows:
       ​  ​​  = ​​[​(1 + ​R1​  ​​)​ × ​(1 + ​R2​  ​​)​ × … × ​(1 + ​RN

   Time-Weighted Rate of Return
   Strubeck Corporation sponsors a pension plan for its employees. It manages
   part of the equity portfolio in-house and delegates management of the balance
   to Super Trust Company. As chief investment officer of Strubeck, you want to
   review the performance of the in-house and Super Trust portfolios over the
   last four quarters. You have arranged for outflows and inflows to the portfolios
   to be made at the very beginning of the quarter. Exhibit 14 summarizes the
   inflows and outflows as well as the two portfolios’ valuations. In Exhibit 11, the
   ending value is the portfolio’s value just prior to the cash inflow or outflow at
   the beginning of the quarter. The amount invested is the amount each portfolio
   manager is responsible for investing.

                               seem as trivial, yet it’s impact on a large portfolio may be substantive.

                                     lion. All dividends were reinvested in additional shares.
                                ■    Because the fund’s performance had been exceptional, institutions
                                     invested an additional USD20 million in Walbright on 1 May, raising
                                     assets under management to USD132 million (USD100 + USD10 +
                                     USD2 + USD20).
                                ■    On 31 December, Walbright received total dividends of USD2.64
                                     million. The fund’s market value on 31 December, not including the
                                     USD2.64 million in dividends, was USD140 million.
                                ■    The fund made no other interim cash payments during the year.

  1. Compute the Walbright Fund’s time-weighted rate of return.

     Because interim cash flows were made on 1 May, we must compute two
     interim total returns and then link them to obtain an annual return. Exhibit

     well as the associated interim four-month (1 January to 1 May) and eight-
     month (1 May to 31 December) holding period returns.

     for one year. The four-month and eight-month intervals combine to equal
     one year. (Note: Taking the square root of the product 1.12 × 1.0806 would
     be appropriate only if 1.12 and 1.0806 each applied to one full year.)

  2. Compute the Walbright Fund’s money-weighted rate of return.
     Solution:
     To calculate the money-weighted return, we need to find the discount rate
     that sets the sum of the present value of cash inflows and outflows equal to
     zero. The initial market value of the fund and all additions to it are treated
     as cash outflows. (Think of them as expenditures.) Withdrawals, receipts,
     and the ending market value of the fund are counted as inflows. (The end-
     ing market value is the amount investors receive on liquidating the fund.)
     Because interim cash flows have occurred at four-month intervals, we must
     solve for the four-month internal rate of return. Exhibit 15 details the cash
     flows and their timing.

                               CF0 refers to the initial investment of USD100 million made at the begin-
                               ning of the first four-month interval on 1 January. CF1 refers to the cash
                               flows made at end of the first four-month interval or the beginning of the
                               second four-month interval on 1 May. Those cash flows include a cash in-
                               flow of USD2 million for the dividend received and cash outflows of USD22
                               million for the dividend reinvested and additional investment, respectively.
                               The second four-month interval had no cash flow so CF2 is equal to zero.
                               CF3 refers to the cash inflows at the end of the third four-month interval.
                               Those cash inflows include a USD2.64 million dividend received and the
                               fund’s terminal market value of USD140 million.
                               Using a spreadsheet or IRR-enabled calculator, we use −100, −20, 0, and
                               USD142.64 for the t = 0, t = 1, t = 2, and t = 3 net cash flows, respectively.
                               Using either tool, we get a four-month IRR of 6.28 percent.

                             IRR = 6.28%
                               The quick way to annualize this four-month return is to multiply it by 3. A
                               more accurate way is to compute it on a compounded basis as: (1.0628)3 – 1
                               = 0.2005 or 20.05 percent.
                               These calculations can also be performed using Excel using the =IRR(cash
                               flows) function, which results in an IRR of 6.28 percent.

                            3. Interpret the differences between the Fund’s time-weighted and mon-
                               ey-weighted rates of return.
                               Solution:
                               In this example, the time-weighted return (21.03 percent) is greater than the
                               money-weighted return (20.05 percent). The Walbright Fund’s performance
                               was relatively poorer during the eight-month period, when the fund had
                               more money invested, than the overall performance. This fact is reflected in
                               a lower money-weighted rate of return compared with the time-weighted
                               rate of return, as the money-weighted return is sensitive to the timing and
                               amount of withdrawals and additions to the portfolio.

                             The accurate measurement of portfolio returns is important to the process of
                         evaluating portfolio managers. In addition to considering returns, however, analysts
                         must also weigh risk. When we worked through Example 9, we stopped short of
                         suggesting that in-house management was superior to Super Trust because it earned
                         a higher time-weighted rate of return. A judgment as to whether performance was
                         “better” or “worse” must include the risk dimension, which will be covered later in
                         your study materials.

Annualized Return                                                                               29


The period during which a return is earned or computed can vary and often we have
to annualize a return that was calculated for a period that is shorter (or longer) than
one year. You might buy a short-term treasury bill with a maturity of three months,
or you might take a position in a futures contract that expires at the end of the next
quarter. How can we compare these returns?
    In many cases, it is most convenient to annualize all available returns to facili-
tate comparison. Thus, daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly returns are converted
to annualized returns. Many formulas used for calculating certain values or prices
also require all returns and periods to be expressed as annualized rates of return.
For example, the most common version of the Black–Scholes option-pricing model
requires annualized returns and periods to be in years.


Non-annual Compounding
Recall that interest may be paid semiannually, quarterly, monthly, or even daily. To
handle interest payments made more than once a year, we can modify the present
value formula as follows. Here, Rs is the quoted interest rate and equals the periodic
interest rate multiplied by the number of compounding periods in each year. In gen-
eral, with more than one compounding period in a year, we can express the formula
for present value as follows:
                               ​Rs​  ​​ −mN
   	​PV = ​FV​  N​​ ​​(1 + ​ _
                             m ​)​​​      ​​,                                          (7)
where

    m = number of compounding periods per year,

   Rs = quoted annual interest rate, and

    N = number of years.
    The formula in Equation 8 is quite similar to the simple present value formula. As
we have already noted, present value and future value factors are reciprocals. Changing
the frequency of compounding does not alter this result. The only difference is the use
of the periodic interest rate and the corresponding number of compounding periods.
    The following example presents an application of monthly compounding.

EXAMPLE 11

  The Present Value of a Lump Sum with Monthly
  Compounding
  The manager of a Canadian pension fund knows that the fund must make a
  lump-sum payment of CAD5 million 10 years from today. She wants to invest
  an amount today in a guaranteed investment contract (GIC) so that it will grow
  to the required amount. The current interest rate on GICs is 6 percent a year,
  compounded monthly.

  1. How much should she invest today in the GIC?

                                In applying Equation 8, we use the periodic rate (in this case, the monthly
                                rate) and the appropriate number of periods with monthly compounding (in
                                this case, 10 years of monthly compounding, or 120 months).



                         Annualizing Returns
                         To annualize any return for a period shorter than one year, the return for the period
                         must be compounded by the number of periods in a year. A monthly return is com-
                         pounded 12 times, a weekly return is compounded 52 times, and a quarterly return
                         is compounded 4 times. Daily returns are normally compounded 365 times. For an
                         uncommon number of days, we compound by the ratio of 365 to the number of days.
                             If the weekly return is 0.2 percent, then the compound annual return is 10.95
                         percent (there are 52 weeks in a year):

                         If the return for 15 days is 0.4 percent, then the annualized return is 10.20 percent,
                         assuming 365 days in a year:

                         A general equation to annualize returns is given, where c is the number of periods in
                         a year. For a quarter, c = 4 and for a month, c = 12:
                             	​​Rannual
                                 ​     ​​  =   ​​(1  + ​Rperiod
                                                         ​      ​​)​​​  c​ − 1​.                                                 (8)

                         How can we annualize a return when the holding period return is more than one
                         year? For example, how do we annualize an 18-month holding period return? Because
                         one year contains two-thirds of 18-month periods, c = 2/3 in the above equation. For
                         example, an 18-month return of 20 percent can be annualized as follows:
                             	​​Rannual
                                 ​     ​​  = ​​(1 + ​R18month
                                                      ​       ​​)​​​  2/3​ − 1 = ​​(1 + 0.20)​​​  2/3​ − 1 = 0.1292 = 12.92%​.
                         Similar expressions can be constructed when quarterly or weekly returns are needed
                         for comparison instead of annual returns. In such cases, c is equal to the number of
                         holding periods in a quarter or in a week. For example, assume that you want to convert
                         daily returns to weekly returns or annual returns to weekly returns for comparison
                         between weekly returns. To convert daily returns to weekly returns, c = 5, assume
                         that there are five trading days in a week. However, daily return calculations can be
                         annualized differently. For example, five can be used for trading-day-based calculations,
                         giving approximately 250 trading days a year; seven can be used on calendar-day-based
                         calculations. Specific methods used conform to specific business practices, market

conventions, and standards. To convert annual returns to weekly returns, c = 1/52.
The expressions for annual returns can then be rewritten as expressions for weekly
returns as follows:

One major limitation of annualizing returns is the implicit assumption that returns
can be repeated precisely, that is, money can be reinvested repeatedly while earning
a similar return. This type of return is not always possible. An investor may earn a
return of 5 percent during a week because the market rose sharply that week, but it
is highly unlikely that he will earn a return of 5 percent every week for the next 51
weeks, resulting in an annualized return of 1,164.3 percent (= 1.0552 − 1). Therefore,
it is important to annualize short-term returns with this limitation in mind.

EXAMPLE 12

  Annualized Returns
  An analyst seeks to evaluate three securities she has held in her portfolio for
  different periods of time.
        ■    Over the past 100 days, Security A has earned a return of 6.2 percent.
        ■    Security B has earned 2 percent over the past four weeks.
        ■    Security C has earned a return of 5 percent over the past three
             months.


  1. Compare the relative performance of the three securities.
      Solution:
      To facilitate comparison, the three securities’ returns need to be annualized:

        ■    Annualized return for Security A: RSA= (1 + 0.062)365/100 − 1 = 0.2455
             = 24.55%
        ■    Annualized return for Security B: RSB = (1 + 0.02)52/4 − 1 = 0.2936 =
             29.36%
        ■    Annualized return for Security C: RSC = (1 + 0.05)4 − 1 = 0.2155 =
             21.55%
      Security B generated the highest annualized return.

                            1. Which ETF has the highest annualized rate of return?
                                 A. ETF 1
                                 B. ETF 2
                                  C. ETF 3
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. The annualized rate of return for the three ETFs are as follows:
                                 ETF 1 annualized return = (1.0461365/146) – 1 = 11.93%

                                 ETF 2 annualized return = (1.011052/5) – 1 = 12.05%

                                 ETF 3 annualized return = (1.143512/15) – 1 = 11.32%
                                 Despite having the lowest value for the periodic rate, ETF 2 has the highest
                                 annualized rate of return because of the reinvestment rate assumption and
                                 the compounding of the periodic rate.



                         Continuously Compounded Returns
                         An important concept is the continuously compounded return associated with a holding
                         period return, such as R1. The continuously compounded return associated with a
                         holding period return is the natural logarithm of one plus that holding period return,
                         or equivalently, the natural logarithm of the ending price over the beginning price
                         (the price relative). Note that here we are using r to refer specifically to continuously
                         compounded returns, but other textbooks and sources may use a different notation.
                             If we observe a one-week holding period return of 0.04, the equivalent continuously
                         compounded return, called the one-week continuously compounded return, is ln(1.04)
                         = 0.039221; EUR1.00 invested for one week at 0.039221 continuously compounded
                         gives EUR1.04, equivalent to a 4 percent one-week holding period return.
                             The continuously compounded return from t to t + 1 is
                             rt,t+1 = ln(Pt+1/Pt) = ln(1 + Rt,t+1).                                          (10)
                         For our example, an asset purchased at time t for a P0 of USD30 and the same asset one
                         period later, t + 1, has a value of P1 of USD34.50 has a continuously compounded return
                         given by r0,1 = ln(P1/P0) = ln(1 + R0,1) = ln(USD34.50/USD30) = ln(1.15) = 0.139762.
                             Thus, 13.98 percent is the continuously compounded return from t = 0 to t = 1.
                         The continuously compounded return is smaller than the associated holding period
                         return. If our investment horizon extends from t = 0 to t = T, then the continuously
                         compounded return to T is
                             r0,T = ln(PT/P0).                                                               (11)
                         Applying the exponential function to both sides of the equation, we have exp(r0,T) =
                         exp[ln(PT/P0)] = PT/P0, so
                             PT = P0exp(r0,T).

Other Major Return Measures and Their Applications                                                 33


We can also express PT/P0 as the product of price relatives:
   PT/P0 = (PT/PT−1)(PT−1/PT−2) . . . (P1/P0).                                       (12)
Taking logs of both sides of this equation, we find that the continuously compounded
return to time T is the sum of the one-period continuously compounded returns:
   r0,T = rT−1,T + rT−2,T−1 + . . . + r0,1.                                          (13)
Using holding period returns to find the ending value of a USD1 investment involves
the multiplication of quantities (1 + holding period return). Using continuously com-
pounded returns involves addition (as shown in Equation 14), which is a desirable
property of continuously compounded returns and which we will use throughout the
curriculum.

APPLICATIONS                                                                                   6
              calculate and interpret major return measures and describe their
              appropriate uses

The statistical measures of return discussed in the previous section are generally
applicable across a wide range of assets and time periods. Special assets, however,
such as mutual funds, and other considerations, such as taxes or inflation, may require
more specific return measures.
    Although it is not possible to consider all types of special measures, we will discuss
the effect of fees (gross versus net returns), taxes (pre-tax and after-tax returns), infla-
tion (nominal and real returns), and the effect of leverage. Many investors use mutual
funds or other external entities (i.e., investment vehicles) for investment. In those cases,
funds charge management fees and expenses to the investors. Consequently, gross and
net-of-fund-expense returns should also be considered. Of course, an investor may be
interested in the net-of-expenses after-tax real return, which is in fact what an investor
truly receives. We consider these additional return measures in the following sections.


Gross and Net Return
A gross return is the return earned by an asset manager prior to deductions for manage-
ment expenses, custodial fees, taxes, or any other expenses that are not directly related
to the generation of returns but rather related to the management and administration
of an investment. These expenses are not deducted from the gross return because
they may vary with the amount of assets under management or may vary because
of the tax status of the investor. Trading expenses, however, such as commissions,
are accounted for in (i.e., deducted from) the computation of gross return because
trading expenses contribute directly to the return earned by the manager. Thus, gross
return is an appropriate measure for evaluating and comparing the investment skill of
asset managers because it does not include any fees related to the management and
administration of an investment.
    Net return is a measure of what the investment vehicle (e.g., mutual fund) has earned
for the investor. Net return accounts for (i.e., deducts) all managerial and administra-
tive expenses that reduce an investor’s return. Because individual investors are most
concerned about the net return (i.e., what they actually receive), small mutual funds
with a limited amount of assets under management are at a disadvantage compared

                         with the larger funds that can spread their largely fixed administrative expenses over
                         a larger asset base. As a result, many small mutual funds waive part of the expenses
                         to keep the funds competitive.


                         Pre-Tax and After-Tax Nominal Return
                         All return measures discussed up to this point are pre-tax nominal returns—that is,
                         no adjustment has been made for taxes or inflation. In general, all returns are pre-tax
                         nominal returns unless they are otherwise designated.
                             Many investors are concerned about the possible tax liability associated with their
                         returns because taxes reduce the net return that they receive. Capital gains and income
                         may be taxed differently, depending on the jurisdiction. Capital gains come in two
                         forms: short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Long-term capital gains
                         receive preferential tax treatment in a number of countries. Interest income is taxed
                         as ordinary income in most countries. Dividend income may be taxed as ordinary
                         income, may have a lower tax rate, or may be exempt from taxes depending on the
                         country and the type of investor. The after-tax nominal return is computed as the
                         total return minus any allowance for taxes on dividends, interest, and realized gains.
                         Bonds issued at a discount to the par value may be taxed based on accrued gains
                         instead of realized gains.
                             Because taxes are paid on realized capital gains and income, the investment manager
                         can minimize the tax liability by selecting appropriate securities (e.g., those subject
                         to more favorable taxation, all other investment considerations equal) and reducing
                         trading turnover. Therefore, taxable investors evaluate investment managers based
                         on the after-tax nominal return.


                         Real Returns
                         Previously this learning module approximated the relationship between the nominal
                         rate and the real rate by the following relationship:
                             	​​(1 + nominal risk–free rate)​ = ​
                                                                (1 + real risk–free rate)​​(1 + inflation premium)​. ​
                         This relationship can be extended to link the relationship between nominal and real
                         returns. Specifically, the nominal return consists of a real risk-free rate of return to
                         compensate for postponed consumption; inflation as loss of purchasing power; and
                         a risk premium for assuming risk. Frequently, the real risk-free return and the risk
                         premium are combined to arrive at the real “risky” rate and is simply referred to as
                         the real return, or:
                                                    ​(1 + real risk–free rate)​​(1+ risk premium)​
                             	​​(1 + real return)​  = ​ ______________________________
                                                               1   
                                                                 + inflation premium  ​​.                         (14)

                         Real returns are particularly useful in comparing returns across time periods because
                         inflation rates may vary over time. Real returns are also useful in comparing returns
                         among countries when returns are expressed in local currencies instead of a constant
                         investor currency and when inflation rates vary between countries (which are usually
                         the case).
                             Finally, the after-tax real return is what the investor receives as compensation for
                         postponing consumption and assuming risk after paying taxes on investment returns.
                         As a result, the after-tax real return becomes a reliable benchmark for making invest-
                         ment decisions. Although it is a measure of an investor’s benchmark return, it is not
                         commonly calculated by asset managers because it is difficult to estimate a general
                         tax component applicable to all investors. For example, the tax component depends

on an investor’s specific taxation rate (marginal tax rate), how long the investor holds
an investment (long-term versus short-term), and the type of account the asset is held
in (tax-exempt, tax-deferred, or normal).

EXAMPLE 14

  Computation of Special Returns
  Let’s return to Example 8. After reading this section, Mr. Lohrmann decided that
  he was not being fair to the fund manager by including the asset management fee
  and other expenses because the small size of the fund would put it at a competi-
  tive disadvantage. He learns that the fund spends a fixed amount of EUR500,000
  every year on expenses that are unrelated to the manager’s performance.
      Mr. Lohrmann has become concerned that both taxes and inflation may
  reduce his return. Based on the current tax code, he expects to pay 20 percent
  tax on the return he earns from his investment. Historically, inflation has been
  around 2 percent and he expects the same rate of inflation to be maintained.

  1. Estimate the annual gross return for the first year by adding back the fixed
     expenses.
     Solution:
     The gross return for the first year is higher by 1.67 percent (= EUR500,000/
     EUR30,000,000) than the 15 percent% investor return reported by the fund.
     Thus, the gross return for the first year is 16.67 percent (= 15% + 1.67%).

  2. What is the net return that investors in the Rhein Valley Superior Fund
     earned during the five-year period?
     Solution:
     The investor return reported by the mutual fund is the net return of the
     fund after accounting for all direct and indirect expenses. The net return is
     also the pre-tax nominal return because it has not been adjusted for taxes
     or inflation. From Example. 8, the net return for the five-year holding period
     was calculated as 42.35 percent.

  3. What is the after-tax net return for the first year that investors earned from
     the Rhein Valley Superior Fund? Assume that all gains are realized at the
     end of the year and the taxes are paid immediately at that time.
     Solution:
     The net return earned by investors during the first year was 15 percent.
     Applying a 20 percent tax rate, the after-tax return that accrues to investors
     is 12 percent [= 15% − (0.20 × 15%)].

  4. What is the after-tax real return that investors would have earned in the
     fifth year?
     Solution:
     The after-tax return earned by investors in the fifth year is 2.4 percent [= 3%
     − (0.20 × 3%)]. Inflation reduces the return by 2 percent so the after-tax real
     return earned by investors in the fifth year is 0.39 percent, as shown:

                         In the previous calculations, we have assumed that the investor’s position in an asset
                         is equal to the total investment made by an investor using his or her own money. This
                         section differs in that the investor creates a leveraged position.
                             There are two ways of creating a claim on asset returns that are greater than the
                         investment of one’s own money. First, an investor may trade futures contracts in which
                         the money required to take a position may be as little as 10 percent of the notional
                         value of the asset. In this case, the leveraged return, the return on the investor’s own
                         money, is 10 times the actual return of the underlying security. Both the gains and
                         losses are amplified by a factor of 10.
                             Investors can also invest more than their own money by borrowing money to pur-
                         chase the asset. This approach is easily done in stocks and bonds, and very common
                         when investing in real estate. If half (50 percent) of the money invested is borrowed,
                         then the gross return to the investor is doubled, but the interest to be paid on bor-
                         rowed money must be deducted to calculate the net return.
                             Using borrowed capital, debt, the size of the leveraged position increases by the
                         additional, borrowed capital. If the total investment return earned on the leveraged
                         portfolio, RP, exceeds the borrowing cost on debt, rD, taking on leverage increases
                         the return on the portfolio. Denoting the return on a leveraged portfolio as RL, then
                         the return can be calculated as follows:
                                             Portfolio return       ​[​RP​  ​​ × ​(​VE​  ​​  + ​V​ B)​​ ​ − ​(​VB​  ​​ × ​r​ D)​​ ​]​               ​VB​  ​​

                         RP < rD then leverage decreases RL.
                             For example, for a EUR10 million equity portfolio that generates an 8 percent
                         total investment return, RP, over one year and is financed 30 percent with debt at 5
                         percent, then the leveraged return, RL, is:

                             investment return, then the leveraged return is:

                             SOLUTIONS
                         1. C is correct. The nominal risk-free rate is approximated as the sum of the real
                            risk-free interest rate and an inflation premium.

                         2. C is correct. US Treasury bonds are highly liquid, whereas the bonds of small
                            issuers trade infrequently and the interest rate includes a liquidity premium.
                            This liquidity premium reflects the relatively high costs (including the impact on
                            price) of selling a position. As the two bond issues have the same 30-year matu-
                            rity, the observed difference in yields would not be solely explained by maturity.
                            Further, the inflation premium embedded in the yield of both bonds is likely to be
                            similar given they are both US-based bonds with the same maturity.

                         3. A is correct. The geometric mean return for Fund Y is calculated as follows:
                                 _
                            	​​​ R ​​  G​​​= [(1 + 0.195) × (1 − 0.019) × (1 + 0.197) × (1 + 0.350) × (1 + 0.057)](1/5) − 1
                              = 14.9%.

                         4. A is correct. The harmonic mean is appropriate for determining the average price
                            per unit as it gives equal weight to each data point and reduces the potential
                            influence of outliers. It is calculated as follows:
                                 _
                            	​​​ X ​​  H​​ = ​4/[(1/62.00) + (1/76.00) + (1/84.00) + (1/90.00)] = EUR76.48.

                         5. B is correct. The geometric mean compounds the periodic returns of every
                            period, giving the investor a more accurate measure of the terminal value of an
                            investment.

                         6. C is correct. The money-weighted rate of return considers both the timing and
                            amounts of investments into the fund. To calculate the money-weighted rate of
                            return, tabulate the annual returns and investment amounts to determine the
                            cash flows.

7. A is correct. Computation of the money-weighted return, r, requires finding the
   discount rate that sums the present value of cash flows to zero. Because most of
   the investment came during Year 2, the money-weighted return will be biased
   toward the performance of Year 2 when the return was lower. The cash flows are
   as follows:
    CF0 = −10

    CF1 = −100

    CF2 = +120.31
    The terminal value is determined by summing the investment returns for each
    period [(10 × 1.14 × 1.08) + (100 × 1.08)].

    This results in a value of IRR = 8.53 percent.
    The time-weighted return of the fund is calculated as follows:

8. B is correct. The annualized rate of return for
    ETF 1 annualized return = (1.0425365/125) – 1 = 12.92%

    ETF 2 annualized return = (1.019552/8) − 1 = 13.37%

    ETF 3 annualized return = (1.171812/16) – 1 = 12.63%
    Despite having the lowest value for the periodic rate, ETF 2 has the highest
    annualized rate of return because of the reinvestment rate assumption and the
    compounding of the periodic rate.

9. A is correct. The continuously compounded return from t = 0 to t = 1 is r0,1 =
   ln(S1/S0) = ln(186.75/208.25) = –0.10897 = –10.90%.

11. C is correct. Gross returns are calculated on a pre-tax basis; trading expenses are
    accounted for in the computation of gross returns as they contribute directly to
    the returns earned by the manager. A is incorrect because investment managers’
    gross returns are pre-tax and not adjusted for risk. B is incorrect because manag-
    ers’ gross returns do reflect the deduction of trading expenses since they contrib-
    ute directly to the return earned by the manager.

                         12. C is correct. The use of leverage can increase an investor’s return if the total
                             investment return earned on the leveraged investment exceeds the borrowing
                             cost on debt. A is incorrect because leverage amplifies both gains and losses. B is
                             incorrect because, if half of the invested capital is borrowed, then the investor’s
                             gross (not net) return would double.

                         13. C is correct. The first step is to compute the investor’s net return from the hedge
                             fund investment. The net return is the fund’s gross return less managerial and ad-
                             ministrative expenses of 1.60 percent, or 8.46% – 1.60% = 6.86%. Note that trad-
                             ing expenses are already reflected in the gross return, so they are not subtracted.

INTRODUCTION
This learning module applies time value of money principles in valuing financial assets.
                                                                                           1
The first lesson focuses on solving for the present value of expected future cash flows
associated with bonds and stocks. In the second lesson, the focus shifts to solving for
implied bond and stock returns given current prices. This includes solving for and
interpreting implied growth rates associated with given stock prices. The final lesson
introduces cash flow additivity, an important principle which ensures that financial
asset prices do not allow investors to earn risk-free profits, illustrated with several
examples. The material covered in this learning module provides an important foun-
dation for candidates in understanding how financial assets are priced in markets.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   The price of a bond is the sum of the present values of the
          bond’s promised coupon payments and its par value. For dis-
          count bonds, the price reflects only the present value of the bond’s par
          value.
      ■   The value of a stock should reflect the sum of the present values of the
          stock’s expected future dividends in perpetuity.
      ■   Stock valuation models are classified by the expected growth pattern
          assumed for future dividends: (1) no growth, (2) constant growth, or
          (3) changing dividend growth.

                                    ■       If a bond’s price is known, the bond’s implied return can be computed
                                            using the bond’s price and its promised future cash flows.
                                    ■       A stock’s required return can be estimated given the stock’s current
                                            price and assumptions about its expected future dividends and growth
                                            rates.
                                    ■       A stock’s implied dividend growth rate can be estimated given the
                                            stock’s current price and assumptions about its expected future divi-
                                            dends and required return.
                                    ■       If valuing two (or more) cash flow streams, the cash flow additivity
                                            principle allows for the cash flow streams to be compared (as long as
                                            the cash flows occur at the same point in time).
                                    ■       Application of cash flow additivity allows for confirmation that asset
                                            prices are the same for economically equivalent assets (even if the
                                            assets have differing cash flow streams).
                                    ■       Several real-world applications of cash flow additivity are used to illus-
                                            trate no-arbitrage pricing.




             2           TIME VALUE OF MONEY IN FIXED INCOME AND
                         EQUITY

                                                     calculate and interpret the present value (PV) of fixed-income and
                                                     equity instruments based on expected future cash flows

                         The timing of cash flows associated with financial instruments affects their value, with
                         cash inflows valued more highly the sooner they are received. The time value of money
                         represents the trade-off between cash flows received today versus those received on a
                         future date, allowing the comparison of the current or present value of one or more
                         cash flows to those received at different times in the future. This difference is based
                         upon an appropriate discount rate r as shown in the prior learning module, which
                         varies based upon the type of instrument and the timing and riskiness of expected
                         cash flows.
                             In general, the relationship between a current or present value (PV) and future
                         value (FV) of a cash flow, where r is the stated discount rate per period and t is the
                         number of compounding periods, is as follows:
                             FVt = PV(1 + r)t.                                                                        (1)
                         If the number of compounding periods t is very large, that is, t→∞, we compound
                         the initial cash flow on a continuous basis as follows:
                             FVt = PVer t.                                                                            (2)
                         Conversely, present values can be expressed in future value terms, which requires
                         recasting Equation 1 as follows:
                             ​FV​  t​​  = PV ​​(1 + r)​​​  t​

                            	​​ = ​FV​  t​​​[_

Fixed-Income Instruments and the Time Value of Money
Fixed-income instruments are debt instruments, such as a bond or a loan, that rep-
resent contracts under which an issuer borrows money from an investor in exchange
for a promise of future repayment. The discount rate for fixed-income instruments
is an interest rate, and the rate of return on a bond or loan is often referred to as its
yield-to-maturity (YTM).
    Cash flows associated with fixed-income instruments usually follow one of three
general patterns:
   ■   Discount: An investor pays an initial price (PV) for a bond or loan and
       receives a single principal cash flow (FV) at maturity. The difference (FV −
       PV) represents the interest earned over the life of the instrument.
   ■   Periodic Interest: An investor pays an initial price (PV) for a bond or loan
       and receives interest cash flows (PMT) at pre-determined intervals over the
       life of the instrument, with the final interest payment and the principal (FV)
       paid at maturity.
   ■   Level Payments: An investor pays an initial price (PV) and receives uniform
       cash flows at pre-determined intervals (A) through maturity which represent
       both interest and principal repayment.


Discount Instruments
The discount cash flow pattern is shown in Exhibit 1:

                                                                interest over the
                                                               investment period
                                                                                    PV
                                               Investor receives
                                              final bond principal

                         The investor’s sole source of return is the difference between the price paid (PV) and
                         full principal (FV) received at maturity. This type of bond is often referred to as a
                         zero-coupon bond given the lack of intermediate interest cash flows, which for bonds
                         are generally referred to as coupons.

                          EXAMPLE 1

                            Discount Bonds under Positive and Negative Interest
                            Rates
                            While most governments issue fixed coupon bonds with principal paid at matu-
                            rity, for many government issuers such as the United States, United Kingdom,
                            or India, investors buy and sell individual interest or principal cash flows sepa-
                            rated (or stripped) from these instruments as discount bonds. Consider a single
                            principal cash flow payable in 20 years on a Republic of India government bond
                            issued when the YTM is 6.70 percent. For purposes of this simplified example,
                            we use annual compounding, that is, t in Equation 5 is equal to the number of
                            years until the cash flow occurs.

                            1. What should an investor expect to pay for this discount bond per INR100 of
                               principal?
                               Solution:
                               INR27.33
                               We solve for PV given r of 6.70 percent, t = 20, and FV20 of INR100 using
                               Equation 5:
                                PV = INR100 / (1 + 0.067)20 = INR27.33.
                               We may also use the Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets PV function:
                                = PV (rate, nper, pmt, FV, type),
                               where:

                             rate = the market discount rate per period,

                             nper = the number of periods,
                             pmt = the periodic coupon payment (zero for a discount bond),

                             FV = future or face value, and

                             type = payments made at the end (0 as in this case) or beginning (1) of each
                             period.
                               As a cash outflow (or price paid), the Excel PV solution has a negative sign,
                               so:
                                PV = (27.33) = PV (0.067,20,0,100,0).
                               While the principal (FV) is a constant INR100, the price (PV) changes as
                               both time passes, and interest rates change.

                            2. If we assume that interest rates remain unchanged, what is the price (PV) of
                               the bond in three years’ time?
                               Solution:
                               INR33.21

Time Value of Money in Fixed Income and Equity                                         49


     Solve for PV by substituting t = 17 into the prior calculation using Equation
     5:
      PV = INR100 / (1 + 0.067)17 = INR33.21.
     The INR5.88 price increase with a constant r represents implied interest
     earned over the three years. If the interest rate is positive, the PV generally
     rises (or accretes) over time to reach FV as time passes and t approaches
     zero.

  3. Prices also change as interest rates change. Suppose after purchase at t =
     0 we observe an immediate drop in the bond price to INR22.68224 per
     INR100 of principal. What is the implied interest rate on the discount bond?
     Solution:
     7.70 percent
     Here we may solve for r in Equation 5 as follows:
      INR22.68224 = INR100 / (1 + r)20.
     Rearranging Equation 5, we get:
      r = 7.70 percent = (100/22.68224)1/20 − 1.
     Alternatively, we may use the Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets RATE
     function:
     = RATE (nper, pmt, PV, FV, type, guess) using the same ar-
     guments as above, with guess as an optional estimate argument, which must
     be between 0 and 1 and defaults to 0.1, as follows:
      7.70 percent = RATE (20,0,-22.68224,100,0,0.1).
     This shows that a 100 basis point (1.00 percent) increase in r results in an
     INR4.65 price decrease, underscoring the inverse relationship between price
     and YTM.

  4. Now consider a bond issued at negative interest rates. In July 2016, Germa-
     ny became the first eurozone country to issue 10-year sovereign bonds at a
     negative yield. If the German government bond annual YTM was −0.05 per-
     cent when issued, calculate the present value (PV) of the bond per EUR100
     of principal (FV) at the time of issuance.
     Solution:
     EUR100.50
     Solve for PV given r of −0.05 percent, t =10, and FV10 of EUR100 using
     Equation 1:
      PV = EUR100.50 = EUR100 / (1 − 0.0005)10,

                               Solution:
                               1.10 percent
                               Use Equation 5 to solve for r given a PV of 95.72, FV of 100, and t = 4, we
                               get:
                               EUR95.72 = EUR100 / (1 + r)4; r = 1.10%,
                               or
                               1.10% = RATE (4,0,-95.72,100,0,0.1).
                               In the case of the Republic of India discount bond, a higher interest rate will
                               reduce the bond’s price. However, in contrast to the accreting price of a dis-
                               count bond, the premium bond’s price will decline (or amortize) over time
                               to reach the EUR100 future value at maturity.

EXAMPLE 2

  Hellenic Republic of Greece Annual Coupon Bond
  At the height of the COVID pandemic, the government of Greece issued a 2
  percent annual coupon bond maturing in seven years.

  1. If the observed YTM at issuance was 2.00 percent, what was the issuance
     price (PV) per EUR100 of principal?
     Solution:
     EUR100
     Solve for PV using Equation 6 with PMTi = EUR2, r = 2.00%, and FV =
     EUR100:
      PV = EUR100

                                                                                      7 ​​.

     We may solve this using the Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets PV function
     introduced earlier (PV (0.02,7,2,100,0)). The issuance price equals the princi-
     pal (PV = FV). This relationship holds on a coupon date for any bond where
     the fixed periodic coupon is equal to the discount rate.
     The present value of each cash flow may be solved using Equation 5. For
     example, the final EUR102 interest and principal cash flow in seven years is:
      PV = EUR88.80 = EUR102/(1.02)7.
     The following table shows the present value of all bond cash flows:
                                                                        ​

                                                                        ​




  2. Next, let’s assume that, exactly one year later, a sharp rise in Eurozone
     inflation drove the Greek bond’s price lower to EUR93.091 (per EUR100 of
     principal). What would be the implied YTM expected by investors under
     these new market conditions?
     Solution:
     3.532 percent
     In this case, we must solve for r using Equation 6, with PV equal to 93.091,
     as follows:
      PV = 93.091 = 2/(1+r) + 2/(1+r)2 + 2/(1+r)3 + 2/(1+r)4 + 102/(1+r)5.
     Here we may use the Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets RATE function
     (RATE (5,2,93.091,100,0,0.1)) to solve for r of 3.532 percent.
     Investors in fixed coupon bonds face a capital loss when investors expect a
     higher YTM.

    The interest rate r used to discount all cash flows in Equation 6 is the bond’s YTM,
which is typically quoted on an annual basis. However, many bonds issued by public
or private borrowers pay interest on a semiannual basis. In Example 3, we revisit
the Republic of India bond from which a single cash flow was stripped in an earlier
simplified example.

                          EXAMPLE 3

                            Republic of India Semiannual Coupon Bond
                            Consider the 20-year Republic of India government bond from which the dis-
                            count bond in Example 1 was separated (or stripped). The bond was issued at
                            an annualized coupon rate of 6.70 percent and a YTM of 6.70 percent, and the
                            coupon payments are semiannual.

                            1. Solve for the price of the bond at issuance.
                                 Solution:
                                 INR100
                                 As coupon periods are semiannual, for a principal of INR100, PMT =
                                 INR3.35 (=6.70/2) and the periodic discount rate is 3.35 percent (=6.70
                                 percent/2), as follows:
                                 PV = 3.35/(1.0335) + 3.35/(1.0335)2 + … + 3.35/(1.0335)39 + 103.35/
                                 (1.0335)40.
                                 As shown in Example 2, because the coupon rate is equal to the YTM, we
                                 expect this bond to have a PV of INR100 at issuance.

                            2. What is the bond’s price if the YTM immediately rises to 7.70 percent?
                                 Solution:
                                 INR89.88
                                 We can solve for the PV as INR89.88 using Equation 6 with r = 3.85%
                                 (=7.70/2) or using the Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets PV function (PV

                                 Solution:
                                 INR26.77
                                 Note that the PV calculation using the same annual discount rate for 40
                                 semiannual periods will differ slightly using Equation 5, as follows:
                                 PV = INR27.66 = (PMT40 + FV40)/(1+r/2)40,

                                 PV(PMT40) = INR0.90 = 3.35 / (1.0335)40,

                                 PV(FV40) = INR26.77 = 100 / (1.0335)40.
                                 Compounding on a semiannual basis for 40 periods, PV(FV40) of 26.77 is
                                 less than the original PV of 27.33 using 20 annual periods from Example 1
                                 (since 1/(1+r)t > 1/(1+r/2)2t when r ≥ 0).

Time Value of Money in Fixed Income and Equity                                                53


    A perpetual bond is a less common type of coupon bond with no stated maturity
date. Most perpetual bonds are issued by companies to obtain equity-like financing
and often include redemption features. As N→∞ in Equation 6, we can simplify this
to solve for the present value of a perpetuity (or perpetual fixed periodic cash flow
without early redemption), where r > 0, as follows:
   PV(Perpetual Bond) = PMT / r.                                                        (7)


EXAMPLE 4

  KB Financial Perpetual Bond
  In 2020, KB Financial (the holding company for Kookmin Bank) issued KRW325
  billion in perpetual bonds with a 3.30 percent quarterly coupon.

  1. Calculate the bond’s YTM if the market price was KRW97.03 (per
     KRW100).
     Solution:
     3.40 percent
     Solve for r in Equation 7 given a PV of KRW97.03 and a periodic quarterly
     coupon (PMT) of KRW0.825 (= (3.30% × KRW100)/4):
      KRW97.03 = KRW0.825 / r ;
     r = 0.85% per period, or 3.40% (=0.85% × 4) on an annualized basis.


Annuity Instruments
Examples of fixed-income instruments with level payments, which combine interest
and principal cash flows through maturity, include fully amortizing loans such as
mortgages and a fixed-income stream of periodic cash inflows over a finite period
known as an annuity. Exhibit 3 illustrates an example of level monthly cash flows

                            An investor seeks a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loan to finance 80 percent of
                            the purchase price of USD1,000,000 for a residential building.

                            1. Calculate the investor’s monthly payment if the annual mortgage rate is 5.25

                                 Solution:
                                 Solve for A using Equation 8 with r = 0.4375% (= 5.25%/12), t of 360, and PV

                                 Solution:
                                 Month 1 interest is USD3,500 and principal is USD917.63
                                 Month 2 interest is USD3,495.99 and principal is USD921.64

                                    Month 1:

                                            Interest: USD3,500 = USD800,000 × 0.4375% (=PV0 × r)

                                            Principal Amortization: USD4,417.63 − USD3,500 = USD917.63

                                            Interest: USD3,495.99 = USD799,082.37 × 0.4375% (=PV1 × r)

                                            − USD921.64

Equity Instruments and the Time Value of Money
Equity investments, such as preferred or common stock, represent ownership shares in
a company which entitle investors to receive any discretionary cash flows in the form
of dividends. Unlike fixed-income instruments, equity investments have no maturity
date and are assumed to remain outstanding indefinitely, or until a company is sold,
restructured, or liquidated. One way to value a company’s shares is by discounting
expected future cash flows using an expected rate of return (r). These cash flows
include any periodic dividends received plus the expected price received at the end
of an investment horizon.
    Common assumptions associated with valuing equity instruments based upon
dividend cash flows often follow one of three general approaches:
   ■     Constant Dividends: An investor pays an initial price (PV) for a preferred or
         common share of stock and receives a fixed periodic dividend (D).
   ■     Constant Dividend Growth Rate: An investor pays an initial price (PV) for a
         share of stock and receives an initial dividend in one period (Dt+1), which is
         expected to grow over time at a constant rate of g.
   ■     Changing Dividend Growth Rate: An investor pays an initial price (PV) for
         a share of stock and receives an initial dividend in one period (Dt+1). The
         dividend is expected to grow at a rate that changes over time as a company
         moves from an initial period of high growth to slower growth as it reaches
         maturity.
    The simplest case of a stock that is assumed to pay constant dividends in perpe-
tuity is shown in Exhibit 4.

                         The price of a preferred or common share expected to pay a constant periodic dividend
                         is an infinite series that simplifies to the formula for the present value of a perpetuity
                         shown and is similar to the valuation of a perpetual bond that we encountered earlier.
                         Specifically, the valuation in Equation 7:

                            Shipline PLC is a company that pays regular dividends of GBP1.50 per year,
                            which are expected to continue indefinitely.

                            1. What is Shipline’s expected stock price if shareholders’ required rate of
                               return is 15 percent?
                                 Solution:
                                 GBP10
                                 Solve for PV using Equation 10, where D is GBP1.50 and the rate of return
                                 per period r is 15 percent:
                                   PV = GBP10.00 = GBP1.50/0.15.

                             Alternatively, a common equity forecasting approach is to assume a constant
                         dividend growth rate (g) into perpetuity, as illustrated in Exhibit 5.

If dividends grow at a rate of g per period and are paid at the end of each period, the
next dividend (at time t + 1) may be shown as follows:
   Dt +1 = Dt (1 + g),                                                                                                   (11)
or generally in i periods as:
   Dt +i= Dt (1 + g)i.                                                                                                   (12)
If dividend cash flows continue to grow at g indefinitely, then we may rewrite Equation
10 as follows:

                            (

    An alternative to constant dividend growth is an assumption of changing growth.
This is common for evaluating the share price of firms expected to experience an
initial rapid rise in cash flow, followed by slower growth as a company matures. The
simplest form of changing dividend growth is the two-stage model shown in Exhibit 6.

                         The example in Exhibit 6 shows a company with an initial higher short-term dividend
                         growth of gs for the first three years, followed by lower long-term growth (gl, where
                         gs > gl) indefinitely thereafter. If we generalize the initial growth phase to n periods
                         followed by indefinite slower growth at gl, we obtain a modified version of Equation
                         14 as follows:

                         Note that the second expression in Equation 15 involves constant growth starting in
                         n periods, for which we can substitute the geometric series simplification:

                         We revisit the Shipline PLC stock price example to evaluate the effects of constant
                         dividend, constant dividend growth and changing dividend growth assumptions on
                         a company’s expected share price.

                          EXAMPLE 7

                            Constant and Changing Dividend Growth
                            Recall that based on a constant GBP1.50 annual dividend and required return
                            of 15 percent, we showed Shipline PLC’s expected stock price to be GBP10.00.
                            Suppose instead that an investment analyst assumes that Shipline will grow its
                            annual dividend by 6 percent per year indefinitely.
