                                   How to Use the CFA
                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.
       The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam
       registration
    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the
viii                                                    How to Use the CFA Program Curriculum


       knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use
       the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
       later review.
           Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
       exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
       and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




       ERRATA
       The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
       reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
       errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
       updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
       error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
       reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

INTRODUCTION
Earlier lessons described markets for financial assets related to equities, fixed income,
                                                                                            1
currencies, and commodities. These markets are known as cash markets or spot
markets in which specific assets are exchanged at current prices referred to as cash
prices or spot prices. Derivatives involve the future exchange of cash flows whose
value is derived from or based on an underlying value. The following lessons define
and describe features of derivative instruments and derivative markets.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   A derivative is a financial contract that derives its value from
           the performance of an underlying asset, which may represent a
           firm commitment or a contingent claim.
       ■   Derivative markets expand the set of opportunities available to market
           participants beyond the cash market to create or modify exposure to
           an underlying.
       ■   The most common derivative underlyings include equities, fixed
           income and interest rates, currencies, commodities, and credit.
       ■   Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets involve the initiation
           of customized, flexible contracts between derivatives end users and
           financial intermediaries.
       ■   Exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs) are standardized contracts traded
           on an organized exchange, which requires collateral on deposit to
           protect against counterparty default.

                            ■   For derivatives that are centrally cleared, a central counterparty (CCP)
                                assumes the counterparty credit risk of the derivative counterparties
                                and provides clearing and settlement services.



                        LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                         These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                         of understanding of this learning module.

                         1. Which of the following statements does not provide an argument for using a
                            derivative instrument?
                            A. Issuers may offset the financial market exposure associated with a
                               commercial transaction.
                            B. Derivatives typically have lower transaction costs than transacting
                               directly in the underlying.
                            C. Large exposures to an underlying can be created with derivatives for a
                               similar cash outlay.
                           Solution:
                           C is correct. Derivative contracts create an exposure to the underlying with
                           a small cash outlay, so this is the statement that does not provide an argu-
                           ment for using a derivative instrument. Statements A and B are statements
                           that are valid arguments for using derivatives.

                         2. Which of the following words makes the following statement correct?
                            Market participants use derivative agreements to exchange cash flows in the
                            future based on a(n) _________________.
                            A. Underlying
                            B. Option
                            C. Hedge
                           Solution:
                           A is correct. Market participants use derivative agreements to exchange
                           cash flows in the future based on an underlying. B is incorrect because op-
                           tion refers to a specific derivative contract type. C is incorrect because hedge
                           refers to a specific purpose of using a derivative contract.

                         3. Which of the following is a significant difference between exchange-traded
                            derivative (ETD) and over the counter (OTC) derivative contracts?
                            A. ETDs create counterparty credit risk for derivative users, while OTC
                               derivatives do not.
                            B. ETDs are standardized contracts, while OTC derivatives are
                               customized.
                            C. ETDs have higher transaction costs compared to OTC derivatives.
                           Solution:
                           B is correct. Exchanges standardize contracts to facilitate trading volume.
                           However, users often require specific customized features, and the OTC
                           market can accommodate these needs. A is incorrect because exchanges
                           bear the counterparty credit risk of derivatives. C is incorrect because ETDs
                           have lower transaction costs compared to OTC derivatives.
Derivative Features                                                                           5


   4. If a corporate issuer enters into a centrally cleared OTC derivative contract,
      which of the following risks is likely of most concern to the issuer and other
      participants in this market?
      A. Interest rate risk
      B. Counterparty credit risk
       C. Systemic risk
      Solution:
      C is correct. Because all the credit risk is taken on by the CCP, all partici-
      pants in this market are most concerned that the CCP is able to satisfy its
      obligations to all contracts. A is incorrect because interest rate risk is an
      underlying risk that can be hedged or managed with certain OTC derivative
      contracts. B is incorrect because the CCP assumes the credit risk from all
      parties to the contracts.

Definition and Features of a Derivative
A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its value from the performance of
an underlying asset. The asset in a derivative is called the underlying. The underlying
may not be an individual asset but rather a group of standardized assets or variables,
such as interest rates or a credit index.
    Market participants use derivative agreements to exchange cash flows in the future
based on an underlying value. For example, Exhibit 1 shows the one-time future
exchange of publicly traded shares of stock at a fixed price in a derivative known as
a forward contract.

                        A derivative does not directly pass through the returns of the underlying but trans-
                        forms the performance of the underlying. In Exhibit 1, AMY Investments agrees
                        today (t = 0) to deliver 1,000 shares of Airbus (AIR) at a fixed price of €30 per share
                        on a future date (t = T), which in our example is in six months. The forward contract
                        allows AMY to transfer the price risk of underlying AIR shares to a second party, or
                        a counterparty, by entering into this derivative contract. If the spot price of AIR (ST)
                        is €25 per share at time T in six months, AMY will either receive €30,000 from its
                        counterparty, a financial intermediary, for 1,000 AIR shares now worth just €25,000,
                        or simply settle with the intermediary the €5,000 difference in cash. Derivative trans-
                        actions usually involve at least one financial intermediary as a counterparty. As we
                        will see later, counterparty credit risk, or the likelihood that a counterparty is unable
                        to meet its financial obligations under the contract, is an important consideration for
                        these instruments.
                            A derivative contract is a legal agreement between counterparties with a specific
                        maturity, or length of time until the closing of the transaction, or settlement. The
                        buyer of a derivative enters a contract whose value changes in a way similar to a long
                        position in the underlying, and the seller has exposure similar to a short position.
                        The contract size (sometimes referred to as notional principal or amount) is agreed
                        upon at the outset and may remain constant or change over time.
                            Exhibit 1 is an example of a stand-alone derivative, a distinct derivative contract,
                        such as a derivative on a stock or bond. An embedded derivative is a derivative within
                        an underlying, such as a callable, puttable, or convertible bond. Exhibit 2 provides a
                        sample term sheet that includes key features of AMY Investment’s stand-alone forward
                        contract with a financial intermediary.

The derivative between AMY and the financial intermediary is a firm commitment,
in which a pre-determined amount is agreed to be exchanged at settlement. Firm
commitments include forward contracts, futures contracts, and swaps involving a
periodic exchange of cash flows. Another type of derivative is a contingent claim, in
which one of the counterparties determines whether and when the trade will settle.
An option is the primary contingent claim.
    Derivative markets expand the set of opportunities available to market participants
to create or modify exposure to an underlying in several ways:
    ■    Investors can sell short to benefit from an expected decline in the value of
         the underlying.
    ■    Investors may use derivatives as a tool for portfolio diversification.
    ■    Issuers may offset the financial market exposure associated with a commer-
         cial transaction.
    ■    Market participants may create large exposures to an underlying with a
         relatively small cash outlay.
    ■    Derivatives typically have lower transaction costs and are often more liquid
         than underlying spot market transactions.
   Issuers and investors use derivatives to increase or decrease financial market
exposures. For example, use of a derivative to offset or neutralize existing or antici-
pated exposure to an underlying is referred to as hedging, with the derivative itself
commonly described as a hedge of the underlying transaction.

QUESTION SET

   Derivative Features

   1. Identify one reason why an issuer may use a derivative instrument.
        Solution:
        An issuer may use a derivative to offset the financial market exposure asso-
        ciated with a commercial transaction. An issuer may also use a derivative to
        offset or neutralize existing or anticipated exposure to an underlying.

                            (ETF)
                                                                    ​




                             Solution:
                             1. B is correct. A callable bond is an example of an embedded derivative
                             within an underlying, which is a contingent claim.
                             2. A is correct. A fixed-price gas delivery contract is an example of a con-
                             tract, which is a firm commitment with natural gas as the underlying.
                             3. C is correct. A FTSE 100 Index exchange-traded fund (ETF) is neither a
                             firm commitment nor a contingent claim but rather an example of a cash or
                             spot market transaction.

                          3. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: Equities are an example
                             of a derivative ____________, and a _______________ is a legal entity enter-
                             ing a derivative contract.
                             Solution:
                             Equities are an example of a derivative underlying, and a counterparty is a
                             legal entity entering a derivative contract.

                          4. Describe the use of a derivative for hedging purposes.
                             Solution:
                             Use of a derivative for hedging purposes involves offsetting or neutralizing
                             an existing or anticipated exposure to an underlying, referred to as hedging.

                          5. Explain the settlement of a forward contract.
                             Solution:
                             A forward contract is a firm commitment. This contract results in a set-
                             tlement payment on the maturity date equal to the difference between the
                             current market price and a pre-agreed forward price.

                                     define a derivative and describe basic features of a derivative
                                     instrument

                        Derivatives are typically grouped by the underlying from which their value is derived.
                        A derivative contract may reference more than one underlying. The most common
                        derivative underlyings include equities, fixed income and interest rates, currencies,
                        commodities, and credit.

Equities
Equity derivatives usually reference an individual stock, a group of stocks, or a stock
index, such as the FTSE 100. Options are the most common derivatives on individual
stocks. Index derivatives are commonly traded as options, forwards, futures, and swaps.
    Index swaps, or equity swaps, allow the investor to pay the return on one stock
index and receive the return on another index or interest rate. An investment manager
can use index swaps to increase or reduce exposure to an equity market or sector
without trading the individual shares. These swaps are widely used in top-down asset
allocation strategies. Finally, options, futures, and swaps are available based upon the
realized volatility of equity index prices over a certain period. These contracts allow
market participants to manage the risk, or dispersion, of price changes separately
from the direction of equity price changes.
    Options on individual stocks are purchased and sold by investors and frequently
used by issuers as compensation for their executives and employees. Stock options
are granted to provide incentives to work toward stronger corporate performance in
the expectation of higher stock prices. Stock options can result in companies paying
lower cash compensation. Companies may also issue warrants, which are options
granted to employees or sold to the public that allow holders to purchase shares at a
fixed price in the future directly from the issuer.


Fixed-Income Instruments
Bonds are a widely used underlying, and related derivatives include options, forwards,
futures, and swaps. Government issuers, such as the US Treasury or Japanese Ministry
of Finance, usually have many bond issues outstanding. A single standardized futures
contract associated with such bonds therefore often specifies parameters that allow
more than one bond issue to be delivered to settle the contract.
    An interest rate is not an asset but rather a fixed-income underlying used in many
interest rate derivatives, such as forwards, futures, and options. Interest rate swaps are
a type of firm commitment frequently used by market participants to convert from
fixed to floating interest rate exposure over a certain period. For example, an invest-
ment manager can use interest rate swaps to increase or reduce portfolio duration
without trading bonds. An issuer, on the other hand, might use an interest rate swap
to alter the interest rate exposure profile of its liabilities.
    A market reference rate (MRR) is the most common interest rate underlying used
in interest rate swaps. These rates typically match those of loans or other short-term
obligations. Survey-based Libor rates used as reference rates in the past have been
replaced by rates based on a daily average of observed market transaction rates. For
example, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is an overnight cash borrowing
rate collateralized by US Treasuries. Other MRRs include the euro short-term rate
(€STR) and the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).


Currencies
Market participants frequently use derivatives to hedge the exposure of commercial
and financial transactions that arise due to foreign exchange risk. For example, export-
ers often enter into forward contracts to sell foreign currency and purchase domestic
currency under terms matching those of a delivery contract for goods or services in a
foreign country. Alternatively, an investor might sell futures on a particular currency
while retaining a securities portfolio denominated in that currency to benefit from a
temporary decline in the value of that currency. Options, forwards, futures, and swaps
based upon sovereign bonds and exchange rates are used to manage currency risk.

                         Commodities
                         Cash or spot markets for soft and hard commodities involve the physical delivery of
                         the underlying upon settlement. Soft commodities are agricultural products, such
                         as cattle and corn, and hard commodities are natural resources, such as crude oil
                         and metals. Commodity derivatives are widely used to manage either the price risk
                         of an individual commodity or a commodity index separate from physical delivery.
                         For example, an airline, shipping, or freight company might purchase oil futures as a
                         hedge against rising operating expenses due to higher fuel costs. An investor might
                         purchase a commodity index futures contract to increase exposure to commodity
                         prices without taking physical delivery of the underlying.


                         Credit
                         Credit derivative contracts are based upon the default risk of a single issuer or a group
                         of issuers in an index. Credit default swaps (CDS) allow an investor to manage the
                         risk of loss from borrower default separately from the bond market. CDS contracts
                         trade on a spread that represents the likelihood of default. For example, an investor
                         might buy or sell a CDS contract on a high-yield index to change its portfolio exposure
                         to high-yield credit without buying or selling the underlying bonds. Alternatively, a
                         bank may purchase a CDS contract to offset existing credit exposure to an issuer’s
                         potential default.


                         Other
                         Other derivative underlyings include weather, cryptocurrencies, and longevity, all
                         of which can influence the financial performance of various market participants.
                         For example, longevity risk is important to insurance companies and defined benefit
                         pension plans that face exposure to increased life expectancy. Derivatives based upon
                         these underlyings are less common and more difficult to price. Exhibit 3 provides a
                         summary of common underlyings.

RARE EARTH FUTURES AND THE LME LITHIUM CONTRACT

   Derivative underlyings continue to adapt to the growing importance of environ-
   mental, social, and governance (ESG) factors affecting commercial and financial
   markets. For example, as the automotive industry shifts from internal combustion
   engine technology to electric vehicle (EV) production due to environmental
   concerns, demand for rare earth metals, such as lithium, as inputs into the EV
   battery production process are of increasing importance.
       In response to growing demand from commodity producers and end users
   as well as investors, the London Metal Exchange (LME) introduced a lithium
   futures contract in 2021. The LME lithium contract is cash settled in USD against
   a weekly published spot price for battery-grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate
   deliverable in China, Japan, and Korea based upon a lot size of one metric ton
   per contract.



Investor Scenarios
The following scenarios consider the specific goals of two parties and review the most
appropriate derivative contract for each.

Scenario 1: Hightest Capital
Hightest Capital is a US-based investment fund with a well-diversified domestic equity
portfolio. Hightest’s senior portfolio manager believes that health care stocks will
significantly outperform the overall index over the next six months. Ace Limited is a
financial intermediary and member of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
    Hightest purchases an option based upon a standardized contract on the S&P 500
Health Care Select Sector Index (SIXV) with Ace as the financial intermediary and
the spot SIXV price as the underlying. SIXV is comprised of approximately 60 health
care equities included in the S&P 500 Index. The contract is a contingent claim, which
grants Hightest the right to purchase SIXV at a 5% premium to the current market
price (spot SIXV × 1.05) in six months.

Scenario 2: Esterr Inc.
Esterr Inc. is a Toronto-based public company with a CAD250 million floating-rate
term loan. The loan has a remaining maturity of three and a half years and is priced
at three-month MRR (which is CORRA, or the Canadian Overnight Reference Rate
Average) plus 150 bps. Esterr’s treasurer is concerned about higher Canadian interest
rates over the remaining life of the loan and would like to fix Esterr’s interest expense.
    Esterr enters into a CAD250 million interest rate swap contract with a financial
intermediary with MRR as the underlying. Under the swap, Esterr agrees to pay a
fixed interest rate and receive three-month MRR on a notional principal of CAD250
million for three and a half years based upon payment dates that match the term loan.
The swap contract is a firm commitment.

                          Derivative Underlyings

                          1. Describe how and why an underlying may be used in employee
                             compensation.
                             Solution:
                             Derivatives with an equity underlying, in particular the stock of a particular
                             issuer, may be included in the compensation of that company’s employees.
                             Stock options are granted to provide incentives to work toward stronger
                             corporate performance in the expectation of a higher stock price, which will
                             cause the options to increase in value.

                          2. Explain how a UK-based importer of goods from the euro zone might use a
                             derivative with a currency underlying to mitigate risk.
                             Solution:
                             A UK-based importer of goods from the euro zone will likely pay EUR for
                             goods that she intends to sell for GBP. To address this currency mismatch,
                             she may consider entering a firm commitment to purchase EUR in exchange
                             for GBP at a pre-determined price in the future based upon terms matching
                             the import contract to offset risk to changes in the underlying spot exchange
                             rate (i.e., GBP depreciation against EUR).

      Solution:
      1. B is correct. Aluminum futures are an example of a metals contract,
      which is a derivative with a hard commodity underlying.
      2. C is correct. SOFR futures are an example of an interest rate contract, not
      a commodity-based derivative contract.
      3. A is correct. Soybean options are an example of a derivative contract with
      an agricultural, or soft, commodity underlying.

             4           DERIVATIVE MARKETS

                                            describe the basic features of derivative markets, and contrast
                                            over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets

                         Derivatives usage was historically dominated by exchange-traded futures markets in
                         soft and hard commodities. Derivatives were expanded to over-the-counter (OTC)
                         financial derivatives in interest rates and currencies in the 1980s, then credit deriv-
                         atives in the 1990s.


                         Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivative Markets
                         OTC markets can be formal organizations, such as NASDAQ, or informal networks
                         of parties that buy from and sell to one another, as in the US fixed-income markets.
                         OTC derivative markets involve contracts entered between derivatives end users
                         and dealers, or financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks or investment
                         banks. OTC dealers, known as market makers, typically enter into offsetting bilateral
                         transactions with one another to transfer risk to other parties. The terms of OTC
                         contracts can be customized to match a desired risk exposure profile. This flexibility
                         is important to end users seeking to hedge a specific existing or anticipated underly-
                         ing exposure based upon non-standard terms. The structure of the OTC derivative
                         markets is shown in Exhibit 4.

                         Exchange-Traded Derivative (ETD) Markets
                         An exchange-traded derivative (ETD) includes futures, options, and other financial
                         contracts available on exchanges, such as the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India
                         or the Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão (B3) exchange in Brazil. ETD contracts are more formal
                         and standardized, which facilitates a more liquid and transparent market. Terms and
                         conditions—such as the size of each contract, type, quality, and location of underlying
                         for commodities and maturity date—are set by the exchange. Exhibit 5 shows the key
                         terms of the London Metals Exchange (LME) lithium futures contract described earlier.

Exchange memberships are held by market makers (or dealers) that stand ready to buy
at one price and sell at a higher price. With standard terms and an active market, they
are often able to buy and sell simultaneously, earning a small bid–offer spread. When
dealers cannot find a counterparty, risk takers (sometimes referred to as speculators)
are often willing to take on exposure to changes in the underlying price.
     Standardization also leads to an efficient clearing and settlement process. Clearing
is the exchange’s process of verifying the execution of a transaction, exchange of pay-
ments, and recording the participants. Settlement involves the payment of final amounts
and/or delivery of securities or physical commodities between the counterparties
based upon exchange rules. Derivative exchanges require collateral on deposit upon
inception and during the life of a trade in order to minimize counterparty credit risk.
This deposit is paid by each counterparty via a financial intermediary to the exchange,
which then provides a guarantee against counterparty default. Finally, ETD markets
have transparency, which means that full information on all transactions is disclosed
to exchanges and national regulators.
     OTC and ETD markets differ in several ways. OTC derivatives offer greater flex-
ibility and customization than ETD. However, OTC instruments have less transpar-
ency, usually involve more counterparty risk, and may be less liquid. ETD contracts
are more standardized, have lower trading and transaction costs, and may be more
liquid than those in OTC markets, but their greater transparency and reduced flexi-
bility may be a disadvantage to some market participants. The structure of the ETD
markets is shown in Exhibit 5.

                         Central Clearing
                         Following the 2008 global financial crisis, global regulatory authorities instituted a
                         central clearing mandate for most OTC derivatives. This mandate requires that a
                         central counterparty (CCP) assume the credit risk between derivative counterparties,
                         one of which is typically a financial intermediary. CCPs provide clearing and settlement
                         for most derivative contracts. Issuers and investors are able to maintain the flexibility
                         and customization available in the OTC markets when facing a financial intermediary,
                         while the management of credit risk, clearing, and settlement of transactions between
                         financial intermediaries occurs in a way similar to ETD markets. This arrangement
                         seeks to benefit from the transparency, standardization, and risk reduction features of
                         ETD markets. However, the systemic credit risk transfer from financial intermediaries
                         to CCPs also leads to centralization and concentration of risks. Proper safeguards
                         must be in place to avoid excessive risk being held in CCPs.
                             Exhibit 6 shows the central clearing process for interest rate swaps which also
                         applies to other swaps and derivative instruments. Under central clearing, a derivatives
                         trade is executed in Step 1 on a swap execution facility (SEF), a swap trading platform
                         accessed by multiple dealers. The original SEF transaction details are shared with
                         the CCP in Step 2, and the CCP replaces the existing trade in Step 3. This novation
                         process substitutes the initial SEF contract with identical trades facing the CCP. The
                         CCP serves as counterparty for both financial intermediaries, eliminating bilateral
                         counterparty credit risk and providing clearing and settlement services.

Investor Scenarios
In this section, we assess the most appropriate derivative markets for the scenarios
presented in the previous lesson.

Scenario 1. Hightest Capital.
Hightest’s index option contract would most likely be traded on the ETD derivative
market. The trade has a standard size, exercise price, and maturity date.

Scenario 2. Esterr Inc.
Esterr’s interest rate swap is likely to be traded in the OTC market. The swap contract
terms are tailored to match the payment dates and remaining maturity of Esterr’s term
loan. Esterr’s counterparty will be a financial intermediary that executes the offsetting
hedge on an SEF and then novates the original SEF trade to face a CCP, which serves
as the credit risk intermediary between dealers.

                            commodities, while __________ is the process of verifying the execution of a
                            transaction, exchange of payments, and recording the participants.
                           Solution:
                           Settlement involves the payment of final amounts and/or delivery of secu-
                           rities or physical commodities, while clearing is the process of verifying
                           the execution of a transaction, exchange of payments, and recording the
                           participants.

                         4. Identify one potential risk concern about the central clearing of derivatives.
                           Solution:
                           The central clearing mandate transfers the systemic risk of derivatives
                           transactions from the counterparties, typically financial intermediaries, to
                           the CCPs. One concern is the centralization and concentration of risks in
                           CCPs. Careful oversight must occur to ensure that these risks are properly
                           managed.

                         5. Describe the steps for clearing a credit default swap.
                           Solution:
                           The counterparties are financial intermediaries that first execute the trade
                           on an SEF (swap execution facility). Then, trade details are shared with a
                           CCP; the novation process substitutes the original contract with another
                           where the CCP steps into the trade and acts as the new counterparty for
                           each original party. The CCP clears and settles the trade.

   Montau AG’s Treasury manager is tasked with addressing the financial risk of
   this prospective transaction.

1. Which of the following statements best describes why Montau AG should con-
   sider a derivative rather than a spot market transaction to manage the financial
   risk of this commercial contract?
   A. Montau AG is selling a machine at a contract price in KRW and incurs costs
      based in EUR.

   B. Montau AG faces a 75-day timing difference between the commercial con-
      tract date and the delivery date when Montau AG is paid for the machine in
      KRW.

   C. Montau AG is unable to sell KRW today in order to offset the contract price
      of machinery delivered to Jeon Inc.

2. Which of the following types of derivative and underlyings are best suited to
   hedge Montau’s financial risk under the commercial transaction?
   A. Montau AG should consider a firm commitment derivative with currency as
      an underlying, specifically the sale of KRW at a fixed EUR price.

   B. Montau AG should consider a contingent claim derivative with the price of
      the machine as its underlying, specifically an A-series laser cutting machine.

                            C. Montau AG should consider a contingent claim derivative with currency as
                               an underlying, specifically the sale of EUR at a fixed KRW price.

                         3. Identify A, B, and C in the correct order in the following diagram, as in Exhib-
                            it 1, for the derivative to hedge Montau's financial risk under the commercial
                            transaction.



                           Exhibit 1


                                                                  Montau AG




                                                           C                  B




                                                                      A




                            A. A: Financial intermediary, B: KRW650,000,000, C: Fixed EUR amount

                            B. A: Jeon Inc., B: KRW650,000,000, C: Fixed EUR amount

                            C. A: Financial intermediary, B: Fixed EUR amount, C: KRW650,000,000.

                         4. Which of the following statements about the most appropriate derivative mar-
                            ket to hedge Montau AG’s financial risk under the commercial contract is most
                            accurate?
                            A. The OTC market is most appropriate for Montau, as it is able to customize
                               the contract to match its desired risk exposure profile.

                            B. The ETD market is most appropriate for Montau, as it offers a standardized
                               and transparent contract to match its desired risk exposure profile.

                            C. Both the ETD and OTC markets are appropriate for Montau AG to hedge
                               its financial risk under the transaction, so it should choose the market with
                               the best price.

                         5. If Montau enters into a centrally cleared derivative contract on the OTC market,
                            which of the following statements about credit risk associated with the derivative
                            is most likely correct?
                            A. Montau faces credit risk associated with the possibility that its counterparty
                               to the contract may not fulfill its contractual obligation.

                            B. Montau poses a credit risk to its counterparty because it may fail to fulfill its
                               contractual obligation.

                            C. Montau poses a credit risk to a derivative contract end user holding a con-
                               tract with the opposite features of Montau’s.
Solutions                                                                                    21




   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. A 75-day timing difference exists between the commercial contract
   date and the delivery date when Montau AG is paid for the machine in KRW. A is
   true but does not explain why the use of a derivative is preferable to a spot mar-
   ket transaction. If as in C Montau were to sell the KRW it receives and buy EUR
   in a spot market transaction on the delivery date, it would be exposed to unfavor-
   able changes in the KRW/EUR exchange rate over the 75-day period. A derivative
   contract in which the underlying KRW/EUR forward rate is agreed today and
   exchanged on the delivery date allows Montau to hedge or offset the EUR value
   of the future KRW payment. The derivative is therefore a more suitable contract
   to address the financial risk of the commercial transaction than a spot market
   sale of KRW.

2. A is correct. The derivative best suited to hedge Montau’s financial risk is a firm
   commitment derivative in which a pre-determined amount is exchanged at
   settlement. The derivative underlying should be currencies, specifically the sale of
   KRW at a fixed EUR price in the future to offset or hedge the financial risk of the
   commercial contract. The machine price referenced under B is not considered an
   underlying, and C hedges the opposite of Montau’s underlying exposure.

3. C is correct as per the following diagram:



  Exhibit 2


                                            Montau AG


                                                          Fixed EUR
                                                           amount
                          KRW 650,000,000                 [KRW/EUR
                                                        forward rate]


                                           Financial
                                         intermediary




4. A is correct. The OTC market is most appropriate for Montau, as OTC contracts
   may be customized to match Montau’s desired risk exposure profile. This is im-
   portant to end users seeking to hedge a specific underlying exposure based upon
   non-standard terms. Montau would be unlikely to find an ETD contract under
   B that matches the exact size and maturity date of its desired hedge, which also
   makes C incorrect.

5. B is correct. In a centrally cleared OTC derivative contract, the central counter-
   party becomes the counterparty in all contracts and assumes the credit risk asso-
   ciated with individual derivative contracts. A is likely incorrect because the CCP
   takes actions to ensure that it can fulfill its obligations to its counterparties. C is
   incorrect because the CCP inserts itself between parties with opposite positions.

INTRODUCTION
An earlier lesson established a derivative as a financial instrument that derives its
                                                                                        1
performance from an underlying asset, index, or other financial variable, such as
equity price volatility. Primary derivative types include a firm commitment in which
a predetermined amount is agreed to be exchanged between counterparties at settle-
ment and a contingent claim in which one of the counterparties determines whether
and when the trade will settle. The following lessons define and compare the basic
features of forward commitments and contingent claims and explain how to calculate
their values at maturity.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Forwards, futures, and swaps represent firm commitments, or
          derivative contracts that require counterparties to exchange an
          underlying in the future based on an agreed-on price.
      ■   Forwards are a flexible over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instrument,

                             ■   Option contracts are contingent claims in which one of the counter-
                                 parties determines whether and when a trade will settle. The option

                             ■   Option contract payoff and profit profiles are non-linear as the
                                 underlying price changes, as opposed to firm commitments, such as
                                 forwards, futures, and swaps, which are linear in underlying price
                                 changes.
                             ■   Market participants often create similar exposures to an underlying

                         LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                          These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                          of understanding of this learning module.

                          1. Which of the following statements correctly describes a difference between
                             a forward contract and a futures contract?
                             A. A forward contract sets an agreed-on price for buyer and seller, while
                                a futures contract does not.
                             B. A forward contract sets an agreed-on transaction date for the seller to
                                deliver the underlying to the buyer, while a futures contract does not.
                             C. A forward contract does not require daily settlement of gains and
                                losses, while a futures contract does.
                            Solution:
                            C is correct. Futures contracts require daily settlement through the ex-
                            change clearinghouse mark-to-market process. Forward contracts are
                            settled at their maturity date, although the two parties to the contract may
                            customize alternative settlement procedures. A is incorrect because both
                            forward and futures contracts set an agreed-on price for a future transac-
                            tion. B is incorrect because both forwards and futures contracts include a
                            maturity date when the underlying will be exchanged.

                          2. Identify which example fits each of the following firm commitments:
                                                                     ​

                                                                         future based on standardized terms
                                                                         set by an exchange
                           C. Fixed-rate payer on an interest rate       3. Agrees to a series of exchanges
                           swap                                          of interest fixed for floating interest
                                                                         payments
                                                                     ​




                            Solution:
                            1. B is correct. A forward contract seller agrees to make a single exchange in
                            the future at a pre-agreed price under an OTC contract.
                            2. A is correct. A futures contract purchaser agrees to a single exchange in
                            the future based on standardized terms set by an exchange.
Introduction                                                                                25


     3. C is correct. A fixed-rate payer on an interest rate swap agrees to a series
     of exchanges of fixed for floating interest payments.

  3. Identify which example fits each of the following contingent claims:
                                            ​

    B. Call option purchaser                    2. Allows the option to expire at matu-
                                                rity of the underlying price is above the
                                                exercise price
    C. Both a put option purchaser and a        3. Pays an option premium to the option
    call option purchaser                       seller when the contract is agreed on
                                            ​




     Solution:
     1. B is correct. A call option purchaser seeks to gain from an increase in the
     underlying price.
     2. A is correct. A put option purchaser will allow an option to expire at ma-
     turity without exercise if the underlying price is above the exercise price.
     3. C is correct. Both a put option purchaser and a call option purchaser will
     pay a premium to the option seller when the option contract is executed.

  4. An option to buy an underlying security at an exercise price of USD45 in
     three months trades at a premium of USD6. After three months, the under-
     lying trades at USD50. Which of the following responses correctly describes
     the profit/loss position of the option buyer and seller?
      A. Option buyer earns USD5 profit, and option seller earns USD5 loss.
      B. Option buyer earns USD1 loss, and option seller earns USD1 profit.
      C. Option buyer earns USD5 profit, and option seller earns USD0.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The option buyer’s position generates a payoff of USD5, equal
     to max(0, 50 – 45). The option buyer paid USD6 to buy the option position,
     and this cash flow more than offsets the positive payoff. Thus, the option
     buyer’s overall profit is a loss of USD1 (i.e., 5 – 6). For the option seller, the
     option position creates a negative payoff of –USD5, equal to –max(0, 50 –
     45). However, the option seller received the option premium of USD6, so the
     overall profit is USD1 (i.e., 6 – 5). A is incorrect because the USD5 amount
     reflects the option payoff only, not profits and losses accounting for the op-
     tion premium. C is incorrect because the buyer’s profit incorrectly states the
     payoff only to the option position, not the profit. The seller’s profit would be
     correct only if the underlying traded at 51, not 50.

  5. A put option buyer earns a positive profit in which of the following
     conditions?
      A. The price of the underlying at option expiration is less than the
         option’s exercise price.
      B. The price of the underlying at option expiration is greater than the
         option’s exercise price.

                                  C. The price of the underlying is less than the option’s exercise price
                                     minus the option’s premium.
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. For a put option buyer to earn a positive profit, the underlying
                                 price must be sufficiently below the put option’s exercise price such that (1)
                                 the put option can be exercised with a positive payoff and (2) the positive
                                 payoff is greater than the option premium paid. Thus, only if the underlying
                                 price falls below the exercise price minus the premium can this occur. A is
                                 incorrect because this condition only implies a positive payoff on the option
                                 but would include prices at which the payoff is not greater than the premi-
                                 um. B is incorrect because the put option would be out of the money and
                                 would generate zero payoff.

                            6. Which of the following positions on the same underlying benefit from oppo-
                               site price movements in an underlying?
                                 A. Long forward contract, short put option
                                 B. Short forward contract, long put option
                                  C. Short forward contract, short put option
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. A short forward position benefits as the underlying price
                                 declines, while a short put benefits only when the underlying price increas-
                                 es. A is incorrect because both a long forward and a short put benefit from
                                 underlying price increases. B is incorrect because both a short forward and
                                 a long put option benefit from underlying price decreases.




             2           FORWARDS, FUTURES, AND SWAPS

                                         define forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, options (calls and
                                         puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics

                         Forwards, futures, and swaps are the most common derivative contracts which repre-
                         sent a firm commitment. This firm commitment is an obligation of both counterparties
                         to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. Key common features of this
                         type of derivative include the following:
                             ■    A specific contract size
                             ■    A specific underlying
                             ■    One or more exchanges of cash flows or underlying on a specific future date
                                  or dates
                             ■    Exchange(s) based on a pre-agreed price
                             Despite their similarities, forwards, futures, and swaps each have different features,
                         which are the subject of this lesson.
                             A forward contract is an over-the-counter (OTC) derivative in which two coun-
                         terparties agree that one counterparty, the buyer, will purchase an underlying from
                         the other counterparty, the seller, in the future at a pre-agreed fixed price. As noted
                         earlier, OTC derivatives offer greater flexibility and customization than exchange-traded
                         derivatives (ETD), but also usually involve more counterparty risk. Forward contracts
Forwards, Futures, and Swaps                                                                 27


are advantageous for derivative end users seeking to hedge an existing or forecasted
underlying exposure based on specific terms. For example, an importer may enter a
forward contract to buy the foreign currency needed to satisfy the commercial terms
of a future goods delivery contract. Forward contracts are more flexible as to the
size, underlying details, maturity, and/or credit terms than a similar ETD. A forward
contract buyer has a long position and will therefore benefit from price appreciation
of the underlying over the life of the contract.
    To gain a better understanding of forwards, we must examine their payoff profile.
Assume a forward contract is agreed at time t = 0 and matures at time T. At time t =
0, the counterparties do not exchange a payment upfront but, rather, agree on delivery
of the underlying at time T for a forward price of F0(T). The subscript refers to the
date on which the underlying price in the future is set (t = 0), and the T in parentheses
refers to the date of exchange (t = T). The spot price of the underlying at time T is ST.
Exhibit 1 shows the payoff from the forward buyer’s perspective, which is a long for-
ward position. Note that the payoff equals the profit, as no upfront payment is made.

                                                               F0(T)

ST < F0(T)                      [ST – F0(T)] < 0                  [F0(T) - ST] > 0


    The symmetric payoff profile shown in Exhibit 1 is a common feature of firm
commitments. Since the derivative price is a linear function of the underlying, firm
commitments are also referred to as linear derivatives. At time T, the transaction is
settled based on the difference between the forward price, F0(T), and the underlying
price of ST, or [ST – F0(T)] from the buyer’s perspective. That is, the buyer realizes a
gain if she is able to take delivery of the underlying at a market value, ST, that exceeds
the pre-agreed price, F0(T). If the forward price exceeds the current market value
[F0(T) > ST], the buyer realizes a loss and must either take delivery of an asset at a
loss of [F0(T) – ST] or pay the seller this amount in cash. Forward contracts usually
involve a single exchange in the future, as in Example 1.

                           Forward Gold Purchase
                           An investor, Procam Investments, enters a cash-settled forward contract with
                           a financial intermediary to buy 100 ounces of gold at a forward price, F0(T), of
                           $1,792.13 per ounce in three months.

                               1. Today’s spot gold price (S0) is $1,770 per ounce.
                               2. At contract maturity, the gold price (ST) is $1,780.50 per ounce.
                               3. The payoff, ST – F0(T), is –$11.63 = $1,780.50 – $1,792.13 per ounce.
                               4. Procam (the buyer) must pay the financial intermediary (the seller)

                         have to pay S0 at t = 0 and realize a return of (ST – S0) at time T in order to create a
                         similar exposure to the long forward position in the cash market.

                           Forwards

                           1. Describe a scenario in which a forward contract has cash settlement of zero
                              at maturity and neither counterparty has defaulted.
                              Solution:
                              A forward contract will have a cash settlement of zero at maturity if ST =
                              F0(T) or the payoff from the buyer’s perspective is [ST – F0(T)] = 0. This is
                              often referred to as the breakeven point for the forward contract for both
                              buyer and seller in the absence of transaction costs and is visually represent-

                              ters a derivative contract with an investor to sell 1,000 barrels of oil in two
                              months at a forward price of $64 per barrel. If the spot oil price at maturity
Futures                                                                                              29


     is $58.50 per barrel, the investor realizes a __________ at maturity equal to
     __________.
     Solution:
     An oil producer enters a derivative contract with an investor to sell 1,000
     barrels of oil in two months at a forward price of $64 per barrel. If the spot
     oil price at maturity is $58.50 per barrel, the investor realizes a loss at matu-
     rity equal to $5,500.
     The oil forward price, F0(T), under the contract equals $64 per barrel.
     At contract maturity, the spot oil price (ST) is $58.50 per barrel.
     • Investor payoff per barrel:
     [ST – F0(T)] = $58.50 – $64.00 = –$5.50 per barrel.
     • Total amount the investor pays the oil producer to settle the forward con-
     tract for 1,000 barrels at maturity:
     1,000 × $5.50 = $5,500.

  3. Identify the most likely forward contract participants that correspond to the
     following statements:
                                              ​




    A. forward contract purchaser                 1. Seeks to benefit from underlying price
                                                  depreciation
    B. Forward contract seller                    2. Realizes a gain if the initial spot price
                                                  of the underlying, S0, exceelds the for-
                                                  ward price of F0(T)
    C. Neither a forward contract purchaser       3. Receives a positive payoff at maturity
    nor a seller                                  if the spot price, ST, exceeds the forward
                                                  price of F0(T)
                                              ​




     Solution:
     1. The correct answer is B. A forward seller pays [F0(T) – ST] to the forward
     contract buyer at maturity and therefore benefits as the underlying spot
     price ST declines over time.
     2. The correct answer is C. Neither the buyer nor the seller of a forward
     contract realizes a gain if the initial spot price, S0, exceeds the forward price
     of F0(T), as settlement is based on the future spot price, ST.
     3. The correct answer is A. The forward contract buyer realizes a gain at
     maturity if ST > F0(T).

              puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics

Futures contracts are forward contracts with standardized sizes, dates, and underly-
ings that trade on futures exchanges. Futures markets offer both greater liquidity and
protection against loss by default by combining contract uniformity with an organized
market with rules, regulations, and a central clearing facility.
    The futures contract buyer creates a long exposure to the underlying by agreeing
to purchase the underlying at a later date at a pre-agreed price. The seller makes the
opposite commitment, creating a short exposure to the underlying by agreeing to sell

                         the underlying asset in the future at an agreed-on price. This agreed-on price is called
                         the futures price, f0(T). The frequency of futures contract maturities, contract sizes,
                         and other details are established by the exchange based on buyer and seller interest.
                             The most important feature of futures contracts is the daily settlement of gains
                         and losses and the associated credit guarantee provided by the exchange through its
                         clearinghouse. At the end of each day, the clearinghouse engages in a practice called
                         mark to market (MTM), also known as the daily settlement. The clearinghouse
                         determines an average of the final futures trading price of the day and designates that
                         price as the end-of-day settlement price. All contracts are then said to be marked to
                         the end-of-day settlement price.
                             As with forward contracts, no cash is exchanged when a futures contract is initiated
                         by a buyer or seller. However, each counterparty must deposit a required minimum
                         sum (or initial margin) into a futures margin account held at the exchange that is
                         used by the clearinghouse to settle the daily mark to market. Futures contracts must
                         be executed with specialized financial intermediaries that clear and settle payments
                         at the exchange on behalf of counterparties, as shown in Example 2.

                         EXAMPLE 2

                           Purchase of a Gold Futures Contract
                                Trade initiation:
                                                    100 ounces of gold                   100 ounces of gold

                           As in Example 1, Procam Investments enters a cash-settled contract to buy 100
                           ounces of gold at a price of $1,792.13 per ounce in three months. Instead of the
                           forward in Example 1, Procam purchases a futures contract [f0(T) = $1,792.13]
                           on the exchange via a financial intermediary. London Metals Exchange rules
                           require an initial cash margin of $4,950 per gold contract (100 ounces) sold or
                           purchased:
                               ■     Procam deposits $4,950 in required initial margin with the exchange.
                               ■     Today’s spot gold price (S0) is $1,770 per ounce, and the opening gold
                                     futures price, f0(T), is $1,792.13 per ounce.
                               ■     At today’s close, the gold futures price, f1(T), settles at $1,797.13 per
                                     ounce.
                               ■     Procam realizes a $500 MTM gain, or $5 per ounce × 100 ounces.
                                     It receives a $500 futures margin account deposit from the
                                     clearinghouse.
                               ■     Procam’s futures margin account has an ending balance for the day of
                                     $5,450, or $4,950 initial margin plus the $500 MTM gain.

                             Each futures contract specifies a maintenance margin, or minimum balance
                         set below the initial margin, that each contract buyer and seller must hold in the
                         futures margin account from trade initiation until final settlement at maturity. The
                         clearinghouse moves funds daily between the buyer and seller margin accounts,
                         crediting the accounts of those with mark to market gains and charging those with
                         mark-to-market losses.
Futures                                                                                     31


    For example, London Metals Exchange rules require a maintenance margin of
$4,500 per 100-ounce gold contract sold or purchased. Now consider the seller of a
futures contract with a position that offsets that of Procam in Example 2.
   ■      Seller deposits $4,950 in required initial margin with the exchange.
   ■      Today’s opening gold futures price, f0(T), is $1,792.13 per ounce.
   ■      At the close, the gold futures price, f1(T), settles at $1,797.13 per ounce.
   ■      Seller realizes a $500 MTM loss, or $5 per ounce × 100 ounces; $500 is
          deducted from its futures margin account by the clearinghouse.
   ■      Seller’s futures margin account has an ending balance of $4,450, or $4,950
          initial margin less the $500 MTM loss.
   ■      Seller’s margin account is $50 below the required maintenance margin
          ($4,450 – $4,500) = –$50
     The seller receives a margin call, or request to immediately deposit funds to return
the account balance to the initial margin. The seller must deposit $500 in order to
bring the margin account back to the $4,950 initial margin. The amount required to
replenish the futures margin account is sometimes referred to as variation margin.
If a counterparty fails to meet the margin call, it must close out the contract as soon
as possible and cover any additional losses. If the counterparty cannot meet its obli-
gations, the clearinghouse provides a guarantee that it will cover the loss itself by
maintaining an insurance fund. Exhibit 2 shows the futures margining and settlement
process, where f0(T) is the futures price at inception and ft(T) represents the futures
price on day t.

Exchanges reserve the right to impose more strict requirements than standard futures
margin account rules to limit potential losses from counterparty default. For example,
for large positions or a significant increase in price volatility of the underlying, an
exchange may increase required margins and/or make margin calls on an intraday
basis. Some futures contracts also limit daily price changes. These rules, called price
limits, establish a band relative to the previous day’s settlement price within which all
trades must occur. If market participants wish to trade at a price outside these bands,

                         trading stops until two parties agree on a trade at a price within the prescribed range.
                         In other cases, exchanges use what is called a circuit breaker to pause intraday trading
                         for a brief period if a price limit is reached.
                             Similar to forward contracts, final settlement at maturity for futures contracts is
                         based on the difference between the futures price, f0(T), and the underlying price of ST,
                         or [ST – f0(T)] from the buyer’s perspective. Because Procam has agreed to purchase
                         gold now (at t = T) valued at $1,780.50 per ounce at a price of $1,792.13 per ounce, it
                         owes $11.63 per ounce, or $1,163 [($1,780.50 – $1,792.13) × 100 oz.] under both the
                         forward from Example 1 and this futures contract. The net payoff profile shown in
                         Exhibit 1 is the same for a futures contract as for a forward assuming they have the
                         same maturity date, with the difference being the timing of the cash flows due to the
                         daily futures contract mark-to-market settlement, as shown in Example 3.

  As the gold futures price, f0(t), falls and the margin balance drops below the
  $4,500 maintenance margin minimum over time, Procam must immediately
  replenish its balance to the $4,950 initial margin each time this occurs:
      ■   On Day T – 4, gold futures fall $10.88 per ounce ($1,797.13 –
          $1,786.25). Procam’s balance falls $1,088 (100 × $10.88) to $4,362
          ($5,450 – $1,088). Procam faces a margin call of $588 ($4,950
          – $4,362).
      ■   On Day T – 2, gold futures fall $4.74 per ounce ($1,782.19 –
          $1,777.45). Procam’s balance falls $474 (100 × $4.74) to $4,070 ($4,544
          – $474). Procam faces a margin call of $880 ($4,950 – $4,070).
      On the final trading day, Procam has paid a total of $1,468 ($588 + $880) in
  margin calls and its futures margin account balance is $5,155, or $205 in excess
  of the $4,950 initial margin. Procam has a cumulative MTM loss of $1,263
  ($1,468 – $205) at the start of the last trading day.
      ■   The prior day’s gold futures settlement price, fT–1(T), is $1,779.50.
      ■   Gold futures rise $1 per ounce on the final trading day to settle at
          fT(T) = $1,780.50 per ounce, the same as for the forward in Example 1.
      ■   The daily change in Procam’s margin account is an increase of $100
          ($1 per ounce × 100 ounces), bringing the margin account to $5,255.
      ■   Procam’s futures margin balance of $5,255 is returned at settlement for
          a net return of $305 ($5,255 – $4,950) in margin.
      ■   Procam receives a net return of $305 in margin at settlement for a
          cumulative loss upon settlement of $1,163 ($305 – $1,468).

    Both the forward and futures contracts involve a $1,163 settlement loss, but the
forward is fully settled at maturity while the futures contract is settled based on
the daily MTM. The time value of money principle suggests that these forward and
futures settlements are not equivalent amounts of money, but the differences are
small for shorter maturities and low interest rates. Also note that under the forward
contract in Example 1, the financial intermediary bears counterparty risk to Procam
for the forward settlement. In practice, financial intermediaries often use collateral
arrangements similar to futures margining for forwards or other derivatives to reduce
counterparty credit risk.
    At maturity, the number of outstanding contracts, or open interest, is settled
via cash or physical delivery. A counterparty may instead choose to enter an offset-
ting futures contract before expiration to close out a position; for example, a futures

                         contract buyer may simply sell the open contract. The clearinghouse marks the con-
                         tract to the current price relative to the previous settlement price and closes out the
                         participant’s position.
                             Futures contracts specify whether physical delivery of an underlying or cash set-
                         tlement occurs at expiration. For example, a commodity futures contract with physical
                         delivery obligates the seller to deliver an underlying asset of a specific type, amount,
                         and quality to a designated location. The buyer must accept and pay for delivery, which
                         ensures that the futures price converges with the spot price at expiration.

               puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics

A swap is a firm commitment under which two counterparties exchange a series of
cash flows in the future. One set of cash flows is typically variable, or floating, and
determined by a market reference rate that resets each period. The other cash flow
stream is usually fixed or may vary based on a different underlying asset or rate. In this
case, we refer to the counterparty paying the variable cash flows as the floating-rate
payer (or fixed-rate receiver) and the counterparty paying fixed cash flows as the
fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver), as shown in Exhibit 4.

Swaps and forwards have similar features, such as a start date, a maturity date, and
an underlying that are negotiated between counterparties and specified in a contract.
Interest rate swaps in which a fixed rate is exchanged for a floating rate are the most
common swap contract. For each period in the future, the market reference rate
(MRR) paid by the floating-rate payer resets, while the fixed rate (referred to as the
swap rate) is constant, as shown in Exhibit 5.

                            Fyleton Investments Swap
                            Fyleton Investments has entered a five-year, receive-fixed GBP200 million
                            interest rate swap with a financial intermediary to increase the duration of its
                            fixed-income portfolio. Under terms of the swap, Fyleton has agreed to receive
                            a semiannual GBP fixed rate of 2.25% and pay six-month MRR.
                                                                         6-Month MRR
                                                       Fyleton                                   Financial

                                                                      2.25% Semiannual
                                Calculate the first swap cash flow exchange if six-month MRR is set at 1.95%.
                                ■    The financial intermediary owes Fyleton a fixed cash flow payment of
                                     GBP2,250,000 (= GBP200 million × 0.0225/2).
                                ■    Fyleton owes the financial intermediary a floating cash flow payment
                                     of GBP1,950,000 (= GBP 200 million × 0.0195/2).
                                ■    The fixed and floating payments are netted against one another,
                                     and the net result is that the financial intermediary pays Fyleton
                                     GBP300,000 (= GBP2,250,000 – GBP1,950,000).

                             The notional principal is usually not exchanged but, rather, is used for fixed and
                         floating interest payment calculations, as in Example 4. The example demonstrates
                         how an investment manager might use an interest rate swap to change portfolio
                         duration without trading bonds. Issuers often use swaps to alter the exposure profile
                         of a liability, such as a term loan.
                             As with futures and forward contracts, no money is exchanged when a swap con-
                         tract is initiated. The value of a swap at inception is therefore effectively zero, ignoring
                         transaction costs. In an earlier fixed-income lesson, it was shown that implied forward
                         rates may be derived from spot rates. Forward MRRs may be used to determine the
                         expected future cash flows for the floating leg of an interest rate swap. The swap rate
                         for the fixed leg payments is determined by solving for a constant fixed yield that
                         equates the present value of the fixed and floating leg payments.
Swaps                                                                                       37


    As market conditions change and time passes, the mark-to-market value of a
swap will deviate from zero, resulting in a positive MTM to one counterparty and
an offsetting negative MTM to the other. Swap credit terms are privately negotiated
between counterparties in an over-the-counter agreement and may range from
uncollateralized exposure, where each counterparty bears the full default risk of the
other, to terms similar to futures margining for one or both counterparties. An event
of counterparty default usually triggers swap termination and MTM settlement as for
any other debt claim. Centrally cleared swaps between financial intermediaries and a
central counterparty (CCP) include margin provisions similar to futures in order to
standardize and reduce counterparty risk.

QUESTION SET

  Swaps

  1. Describe a similarity of and a difference between forward and swap
     contracts.
     Solution:
     Similarities: Both forwards and swaps represent firm commitments with an
     initial value of zero where cash flows are exchanged in the future at a pre-
     agreed price.
     Difference: Forwards usually involve one future exchange of cash flows,
     while a swap contract involves more than one exchange of future cash flows.

  2. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: Under a swap contract,
     we refer to the counterparty paying the variable cash flows as the ___-___
     ___ and the counterparty paying fixed cash flows as the ___-___ ___.
     Solution:
     Under a swap contract, we refer to the counterparty paying the variable cash
     flows as the floating-rate payer (or fixed-rate receiver) and the counterparty
     paying fixed cash flows as the fixed-rate payer (or floating-rate receiver).

  3. Identify the interest rate swap participants that correspond to the following
     statements:
                                          ​




    A. Fixed-rate payer                       1. Makes a payment each interest period
                                              based on a market reference rate
    B. Floating-rate payer                    2. May face a positive or a negative mark
                                              to market over the life of an interest rate
                                              swap contract
    C. Both a fixed-rate payer and a          3. Receives a net payment on the swap
    floating-rate payer                       for any interest period for which the
                                              market reference rate exceeds the fixed
                                              rate
                                          ​




     Solution:
     1. The correct answer is B. A floating-rate payer on a swap makes a payment
     each period based on a market reference rate.
     2. The correct answer is C. Both a fixed-rate payer and a floating-rate payer
     may face a positive MTM or negative MTM on a swap contract.

                                3. The correct answer is A. A fixed-rate payer (also known as the float-
                                ing-rate receiver) receives a net payment if the market reference rate exceeds
                                the fixed rate for a given period.




             5           OPTIONS

                                        define forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, options (calls and
                                        puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics
                                        determine the value at expiration and profit from a long or a short
                                        position in a call or put option
                                        contrast forward commitments with contingent claims


                         Contingent claims are a type of ETD or OTC derivative contract in which one of the
                         counterparties has the right to determine whether a trade will settle based on the
                         underlying value. Option contracts are the most common contingent claim. Similar
                         to forwards and futures, options are derivative contracts between a buyer and a seller
                         that specify an underlying, contract size, a pre-agreed execution price, and a maturity
                         date. The option buyer has the right but not the obligation to transact the trade, and
                         the option seller has the obligation to fulfill the transaction as chosen by the option
                         buyer. As a consequence, the payoff to an option buyer is always zero or positive. It
                         can never be negative.
                             Assume an option buyer pays a premium (c0) of $5 at t = 0 for the right—but not
                         the obligation—to buy stock S at time T at a pre-agreed price (X) of $30. The option
                         buyer’s decision at maturity depends on the stock price at maturity (ST), as shown in
                         the following two scenarios:


                         Scenario 1: Transact (ST > X)
                            ■    If ST = $40, the option buyer chooses to exercise the option and buy the
                                 stock for X = $30.
                            ■    The option buyer gains $10 [(ST – X) = $40 – $30] on the transaction.
                            ■    The option buyer realizes a $5 profit [(ST – X) – c0 = ($40 – $30) – $5].


                         Scenario 2: Do Not Transact (ST < X)
                            ■    If ST = $25, the option buyer chooses not to exercise the option and buy the
                                 stock for X = $30.
                            ■    The option buyer realizes a $5 loss (c0 = $5).
                         Exhibit 6 shows the option mechanics for the case where the option buyer pays for
                         the right to purchase an underlying stock S at a pre-agreed execution price of X in
                         the future (t = T).

The decision to transact the underlying is referred to as an exercise, and the pre-agreed
execution price is called the exercise price (or strike price). Option buyers may transact
the underlying in the future at their sole discretion at the exercise price, a pre-agreed
future spot price that may be above, at, or below the forward price, as shown in an
earlier lesson. This right to exercise in the future has a value that is paid upfront to
the option seller in the form of an option premium.
    Option contract terms, such as the right to buy or sell, exercise price, maturity,
and size, may either be agreed on between the counterparties in an over-the-counter
transaction or executed on an exchange based on standardized terms. This lesson
focuses on European options, or options that may be exercised only at maturity,
although other option styles exist. American options, for example, may be exercised
at any time from contract inception until maturity. Note the labels “European” and
“American” refer not to where these options are used but, rather, to the difference in
when they can be exercised.
    Two primary option types exist—namely, (1) the right to buy an underlying known as
a call option and (2) the right to sell the underlying, or a put option. An option buyer
will exercise a call or put option only if it returns a positive payoff. If not exercised,
the option expires worthless, and the option buyer’s loss equals the premium paid.
    One factor in an option’s value prior to maturity (t < T) is the option’s exercise
value at time t, which is referred to as an option’s intrinsic value.
    We can say a call option is in-the-money at time t if the spot price, St, exceeds X,
with an intrinsic value equal to (St – X). Both out-of-the-money options (where St
< X) and at-the-money options (St = X) have zero intrinsic value, so their price, ct,
consists solely of time value.
    Call option buyers will gain from a rise in the price of the underlying. Exhibit 7
shows the payoff and profit at maturity for a call option buyer.

                         The option buyer pays a call option premium, c0, at time t = 0 to the option seller and
                         has the right to purchase the underlying, ST, at an exercise price of X at time t = T.
                         The exercise payoff (ST – X) is positive if ST > X and zero if ST ≤ X. The call option
                         value at maturity, cT, may be expressed as follows:
                            cT = max(0, ST – X).                                                               (1)
                         The call option buyer’s profit equals the payoff minus the call premium, c0 (ignoring
                         the time value of money in this lesson):
                            Π = max(0, ST – X) – c0.                                                           (2)
                         This asymmetric payoff profile is a common feature of contingent claims, which are
                         sometimes referred to as non-linear derivatives.

                         EXAMPLE 5

                           Hightest Capital—Call Option Purchase
                           Hightest Capital purchases a call option on the S&P 500 Health Care Select
                           Sector Index (SIXV). This six-month exchange-traded option contract has a
                           size of 100 index units and an exercise price of $1,240 per unit versus the ini-
                           tial SIXV spot price of $1,180.95. The option premium paid upfront is $24.85
                           per unit, or $2,485 (= $24.85 × 100). As the option nears maturity, a Hightest
                           analyst is asked to determine the expected option payoff and profit per unit at
                           maturity under different scenarios for the SIXV spot price on the exercise date.
                                She compiles the following table:

                                c0 = Call option premium = $24.85 per unit.

                                = Exercise price at time T = $1,240 per unit.

                                ST = Spot price per unit at time T.

    Example 5 raises another question regarding an option’s value prior to maturity
(t < T). The longer the time to option maturity, the more likely it is that a favorable
change in the underlying price will increase both the likelihood and profitability of
exercise. This time value of an option is always positive and declines to zero as an
option reaches maturity.
    In contrast to the call option buyer with unlimited upside potential and a loss limited
to the premium paid, the call option seller receives a maximum of the premium and
faces unlimited downside risk as the underlying appreciates above the exercise price.
The short call payoff profile in Exhibit 8 is a mirror image of Exhibit 7.

The option buyer and seller payoff profiles demonstrate the one-sided nature of
counterparty credit risk for contingent claims. That is, the option seller has no credit
exposure to the option buyer once the premium is paid. However, the option buyer faces
the counterparty credit risk of the option seller equal to the option payoff at maturity.
    Put option buyers benefit from a lower underlying price by selling the underlying
at a pre-agreed exercise price. A put option buyer exercises when the underlying price
is below the exercise price (ST < X), as shown in Exhibit 9.

                         The put option buyer pays a premium of p0 at inception to the option seller and will
                         exercise the option only if (X – ST) > 0. As in Equations 1 and 2, we may show the
                         long put option payoff and profit, Π, as follows:
                            pT = max(0, X – ST).                                                            (3)

                            Π = max(0, X – ST) – p0.                                                        (4)
                         The payoff or profit from a put option seller’s perspective is the opposite of the put
                         option buyer’s gain or loss for a given underlying price at expiration. As in the case of
                         the call option seller, the put option seller has a maximum gain equal to the premium.
                         However, although a call option seller faces unlimited potential loss as the underlying
                         appreciates beyond the exercise price, the put option seller’s loss is usually limited
                         because the underlying price cannot fall below zero. The short put option payoff and

                            1. Calculate the SIXV spot price at maturity from Example 5 at which Hightest
                               Capital will reach a breakeven point and earn zero profit.
                               Solution:
                               The call purchaser has a profit equal to max(0, ST – X) – c0. In the case of
                               Hightest in Example 5, the SIXV exercise price is $1,240 and the initial call
                               premium is $24.85. The breakeven or zero profit point is therefore equal to
                               $1,240 + $24.85, or $1,264.85.

   2. A put option seller receives a $5 premium for a put option sold on an un-
      derlying with an exercise price of $30. What is the option seller’s maximum
      profit under the contract? What is the maximum loss under the contract?
      Solution:
      A put option seller receives a $5 premium (p0) for a put option sold on an
      underlying with an exercise price (X) of $30. The put option seller’s profit is
      Π = –max(0, X – ST) + p0. If the option is unexercised, –max(0, X – ST) = 0
      and the put seller earns p0 = $5. If the option is exercised and ST = 0, then Π
      = –max(0, 30 – 0) + 5 = –$25. Therefore, the option seller’s maximum profit
      under the contract is $5 and the maximum loss under the contract is $25.

      Solution:
      1. The correct answer is C. An option seller has no counterparty credit risk
      to the option buyer once the upfront premium has been paid.
      2. The correct answer is B. A call option seller earns a profit equal to the pre-
      mium if the underlying price at maturity is less than the exercise price.
      3. The correct answer is A. A put option seller earns a profit equal to the
      premium if the underlying price at maturity is greater than the exercise
      price.




CREDIT DERIVATIVES

               define forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, options (calls and
               puts), and credit derivatives and compare their basic characteristics

Credit derivative contracts are based on a credit underlying, or the default risk of a
single debt issuer or a group of debt issuers in an index. The most common credit
derivative contract is a credit default swap. CDS contracts allow an investor to manage
the risk of loss from issuer default separately from a cash bond. CDS contracts trade
based on a credit spread (CDS credit spread) similar to that of a cash bond. Credit
spreads depend on the probability of default (POD) and the loss given default (LGD),
as shown in an earlier lesson. A higher credit spread (or higher likelihood of issuer
financial distress) corresponds to a lower cash bond price, and vice versa.
    Despite their name, CDS contracts are contingent claims that share some features
of firm commitments. Unlike the call and put options discussed earlier, both the
timing of exercise and payment upon exercise under a CDS contract vary depending

                         on the underlying issuer(s). As in the case of a standard interest rate swap, a CDS
                         contract priced at a par spread has a zero net present value, and the notional amount
                         is not exchanged but, rather, serves as a basis for spread and settlement calculations.
                             In a CDS contract, the credit protection buyer pays the credit protection seller
                         to assume the risk of loss from the default of an underlying third-party issuer. If an
                         issuer credit event occurs—usually defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay an obliga-
                         tion, or an involuntary debt restructuring—the credit protection seller pays the credit
                         protection buyer to settle the contract. This contingent payment equals the issuer loss
                         given default for the CDS contract notional amount. Exhibit 10 shows the periodic
                         cash flows under a CDS contract.

                         The underlying may be a corporate or sovereign issuer, an index of issuers, or a special
                         purpose entity with a portfolio of loans, mortgages, or bonds.
                             A buyer can use a CDS contract as a hedge of existing credit exposure to the
                         underlying issuer. The credit protection afforded by a CDS is similar to insurance for
                         a buyer with an existing fixed-income exposure to the third-party issuer. The buyer
                         may suffer a loss in value on its fixed-income exposure from the credit event but will
                         receive a payment from the CDS contract that will offset that loss.
                             A credit protection buyer without the corresponding fixed-income exposure who
                         buys a CDS is seeking to gain from higher credit spreads (which correspond to lower
                         cash bond prices) for an underlying issuer and is therefore short credit risk.
                             The credit protection seller receives a periodic fixed spread payment in exchange
                         for assuming the contingent risk of paying the credit protection buyer to offset the loss
                         under a credit event. The contract structure is similar to insurance, with the periodic
                         premium over the life of the contract agreed to upfront and with the timing and size
                         of the loss under the credit event being unknown. The seller’s position is therefore
                         similar to that of a long risk position in the issuer’s underlying bond.
                             For example, Exhibit 11 shows the CDS contract for an underlying issuer that
                         experiences credit migration (t = 1) followed by a credit event (t = 2).

The protection buyer agrees to pay a fixed spread of 100 bps p.a. at t = 0 for the con-
tract term. As the issuer’s CDS spread widens to 250 bps p.a. at t = 1, the buyer gains
on the CDS contract due to the low fixed spread paid while the seller loses due to the
low fixed spread received relative to the current higher CDS market spread. As for
any fixed-income instrument, the effective duration of the remaining contract may
be used to approximate the MTM change. An issuer credit event at t = 2 causes the
contract to terminate, and the seller must make a payment to the buyer equal to the
percentage of loss (LGD) multiplied by the CDS contract notional.

   1. Determine the correct answer to fill in the blanks: The contingent payment
      under a credit default swap equals the ____ ____ ____ for the CDS notional
      amount specified in the contract.
      Solution:
      The contingent payment under a credit default swap equals the loss given
      default for the CDS notional amount specified in the contract.

   2. Describe how a credit protection seller’s position is similar to that of an
      underlying cash bond investment.
      Solution:
      A credit protection seller receives a periodic CDS spread payment in ex-
      change for the contingent risk of payment to the buyer under an issuer cred-
      it event. A cash bond investor receives a periodic coupon that incorporates
46   Learning Module 2                        Forward Commitment and Contingent Claim Features and Instruments


                              an issuer’s credit spread in exchange for a potential loss if the issuer defaults.
                              Under the CDS contract and the cash bond, this potential payment or loss
                              equals the LGD. The credit protection seller’s position is therefore similar to
                              that of a long risk position in the issuer’s underlying bond.

                              Solution:

                              higher issuer credit spreads.
                              2. The correct answer is C. Both the credit protection buyer and credit pro-
                              tection seller enter into a derivative contract that transfers the risk of loss
                              from a credit event of an underlying third-party issuer.
                              3. The correct answer is B. A credit protection seller faces an MTM gain
                              on the CDS contract if the CDS spread of the underlying issuer falls. The
                              decline in the issuer’s CDS spread versus the original fixed spread on the
                              CDS contract means that the protection seller is receiving an above-market
                              spread. This above-market CDS spread more than compensates the seller for
                              the new, lower level of credit risk and results in an MTM gain.




             7           FORWARD COMMITMENTS VS. CONTINGENT CLAIMS

                                       contrast forward commitments with contingent claims

                         A firm commitment requires both counterparties to perform under a derivative
                         contract, while an option buyer can decide whether to perform under the contract
                         at maturity depending on the underlying price relative to the exercise price. Market
                         participants often create similar exposures to an underlying using these different
                         derivative instrument types. For example, both a long forward position and a long
                         call option position will gain from an increase in the underlying price. Exhibit 12
                         contrasts the payoff and profit of these two derivative contracts, where the exercise
                         price, X, equals the forward price, F0(T).

As shown earlier, both the long forward and the call option payoffs increase as ST
rises. In the case of a forward, this linear relationship is equal to [ST – F0(T)], with
the payoff equal to profit because no cash is exchanged at inception. For the buyer of
a call option with an exercise price of F0(T), Equation 2 changes to
   Π = max[0, ST – F0(T)] – c0.
Setting the forward payoff/profit [ST – F0(T)] equal to the call option profit, Π, gives
us the following relative profit profile between the forward and option:
    ■   ST – F0(T) > –c0 Forward profit exceeds option profit
    ■   ST – F0(T) = –c0 Forward profit equals call option profit
    ■   ST – F0(T) < –c0 Option profit exceeds forward profit
    The side-by-side comparison in Exhibit 12 between the forward and call option
profit diagrams shows the long call option’s similarity to a long position in the under-
lying with downside protection in exchange for paying a premium.
    Another contingent claim that benefits from a rise in the underlying price is the
sold put option. While the long call option and long forward payoffs both rise when
the underlying price is above the exercise price, the put option seller’s profit is limited
to the upfront premium. Exhibit 13 contrasts the short put payoff and profit with a
long forward if the exercise price, X, equals F0(T).

                         We can compare the long forward payoff/profit of [ST – F0(T)] to a modified version
                         of Equation 6:
                            Π = –max[0, F0(T) – ST] + p0.
                         Setting the forward profit [ST – F0(T)] equal to the put option profit, Π, gives us the
                         following relative profit profile between the forward and option:
                            ■    ST – F0(T) > p0 Forward profit exceeds option profit
                            ■    ST – F0(T) = p0 Forward profit equals option profit)
                            ■    ST – F0(T) < p0 Option profit exceeds forward profit
                            The side-by-side comparison in Exhibit 13 of the forward and sold put option profit
                         diagrams shows the sold put option’s similarity to a long position in the underlying,
                         with gains from price appreciation forgone in exchange for receiving a premium. The
                         apparent symmetry between long call and short put positions and the long forward
                         position will be examined in greater detail in a later lesson.

     price (X) equal to the forward price, F0(T) have the same profit.
     Solution:
     The short forward and long put positions will have the same profit when
     F0(T) – ST = –p0. A short forward position gains from a decline in the
     underlying price with a payoff/profit of [F0(T) – ST], and a long put position
     has a profit of Π = max[0, F0(T) – ST] – p0, from Equation 4, with an exer-
     cise price equal to the forward price, X = F0(T).

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                         The following information relates to questions
                         1-4
                            Biomian Limited is a Mumbai-based biotech company with common stock and
                            listed futures and options on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Viswan
                            Family Office (VFO) currently owns 10,000 Biomian common shares. VFO would
                            like to reduce its long Biomian position and diversify its equity market exposure
                            but will delay a cash sale of shares for tax reasons for six months.

                         1. Which of the following derivative contracts available to VFO’s chief investment
                            officer is best suited to reduce exposure to a decline in Biomian’s stock price in
                            the next six months?
                            A. A short put position on Biomian stock that expires in six months

                            B. A long call position on Biomian stock that expires in six months

                            C. A short futures position in Biomian stock that settles in six months

                         2. VFO’s market strategist believes that Biomian’s share price will rise over the next
                            six months but would like to protect against a decline in Biomian’s share price
                            over the period. Which of the following positions is best suited for VFO to man-
                            age its existing Biomian exposure based on this view?
                            A. A long put position on Biomian stock that expires in six months

                            B. A short call position on Biomian stock that expires in six months

                            C. A long futures position in Biomian stock that settles in six months

                         3. Assume that Biomian shares rise over the next six months. Which of the fol-
                            lowing statements about VFO’s derivative strategies under this scenario is most
                            accurate?
                            A. A forward sale of Biomian shares in six months would be more profitable
                               than purchasing the right to sell Biomian shares in six months.

                            B. Purchasing the right to sell Biomian shares in six months would be more
                               profitable than a forward sale of Biomian shares in six months.

                            C. We do not have enough information to determine whether a forward sale or
                               the right to sell Biomian shares will be more profitable in six months.

                         4. VFO’s market strategist is considering a six-month call option strategy on the
                            NIFTY 50 benchmark Indian stock market index to increase broad market equity
                            exposure. The NIFTY 50 price today is INR15,200, and the strategist observes
                            that a call option with a INR16,000 exercise price (X) is trading at a premium of
                            INR1,500. Which of the following represents the payoff and profit of this strategy
                            just prior to maturity if the NIFTY 50 is trading at INR16,500?
                            A. Payoff is INR500; profit is –INR1,000.

                            B. Payoff is INR1,300; profit is INR800.
Practice Problems                             51


   C. Payoff is INR1,300; profit is INR500.

                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. C is correct. VFO may consider either a short futures position in (or a forward
                            sale of ) Biomian shares in six months to achieve its objective. This firm commit-
                            ment allows VFO to offset its long position with a short position in six months
                            at a pre-agreed price. The futures contract is an exchange-traded derivative with
                            standardized terms set by the exchange and requires initial margin and daily
                            settlement. Answers A and B are contingent claims that can both potentially
                            increase, not decrease, VFO’s exposure to Biomian stock in six months.

                         2. A is correct. VFO should purchase a six-month put option on Biomian shares to
                            manage its exposure based on the market strategist’s view. This contingent claim
                            grants VFO the right but not the obligation to sell Biomian shares at a pre-agreed
                            exercise price in exchange for a premium. A put option buyer exercises the op-
                            tion at maturity when the underlying price is below the exercise price. This allows
                            VFO to continue to benefit from a rise in Biomian’s share price over the next six
                            months with a limited downside. Neither B nor C provides VFO with downside
                            protection if Biomian stock declines in six months.

                         3. C is correct. Under a forward sale of Biomian shares, the profit is [F0(T) – ST]. If
                            the shares rise significantly over the next six months—that is, ST > F0(T)—then
                            VFO’s loss on the derivative is the difference between the Biomian forward price,
                            F0(T), and the spot price, ST. Under the long put option on Biomian shares,
                            VFO’s profit is max(0, X – ST) – p0. If Biomian shares rise significantly over the
                            next six months (i.e., ST > X), then the option expires worthless and VFO’s loss is
                            limited to the put premium paid, p0. If [F0(T) – ST] > –p0, then VFO’s loss would
                            be greater under the firm commitment than under the contingent claim.

                         4. A is correct. The profit is equal to Π = max(0, ST – X) – c0, and the payoff is equal
                            to max(0, ST – X). The exercise price is INR16,000, and the spot price just prior
                            to maturity is INR16,500, so Π = –1,000 [= (16,500 – 16,000) – 1,500], and the
                            payoff is equal to INR500 [= (16,500 – 16,000)].

INTRODUCTION
Earlier lessons described how derivatives expand the set of opportunities available to
                                                                                         1
market participants to create or modify exposure or to hedge the price of an under-
lying. This learning module describes the benefits and risks of using derivatives and
compares their use among issuers and investors.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   Derivatives allow market participants to allocate, manage, or
          trade exposure without exchanging an underlying in the cash
          market.
      ■   Derivatives also offer greater operational and market efficiency than
          cash markets and allow users to create exposures unavailable in cash
          markets.
      ■   Derivative instruments can involve risks such as a high degree of
          implicit leverage and less transparency in some cases than cash
          instruments, as well as basis, liquidity, and counterparty credit risks.
          Excessive risk taking in the past by market participants through the
          use of derivatives has contributed to market destabilization and sys-
          temic risk.
      ■   Issuers typically use derivative instruments to offset or hedge mar-
          ket-based underlying exposures that impact their assets, liabilities, and
          earnings.
      ■   Issuers usually seek hedge accounting treatment for derivatives to
          minimize income statement and cash flow volatility.

                             ■   Investors use derivatives to modify investment portfolio cash flows,
                                 replicate investment strategy returns in cash markets, and/or create
                                 exposures unavailable to cash market participants.



                         LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                          These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                          of understanding of this learning module.

                             A. It is easier to take a short position in the futures market than in the
                                cash market.
                             B. There is greater liquidity in the futures market than in the cash
                                market.
                              C. Cash requirements to buy in the cash market are lower than margin
                                 requirements to buy in the futures market.
                             Solution:
                             C is correct. The opposite is true: Margin requirements of a futures contract
                             are typically only a small percentage of the cash requirement to buy the
                             same amount of underlying in the cash market. A and B are both incorrect
                             because both of these statements describe operational advantages of futures
                             markets over cash markets.

                          2. Identify which derivative risk fits each of the following statements:
                                                                   ​

                                                           hedged transaction

                                                           agreement
                                                                   ​




                             Solution

                             1. B is correct. Liquidity risk is the potential divergence between the cash
                                flow timing of a derivative versus an underlying or hedged transaction.
                             2. A is correct. Basis risk is the potential divergence between the
                                expected value of a derivative versus an underlying or hedged
                                transaction.
                             3. C is correct. Counterparty credit risk is the potential for a deriva-
                                tives contract participant to fail to meet their obligations under an
                                agreement.

   3. Identify which benefit of derivatives use fits each of the following examples:
                                               ​




    A. Price discovery function      1. Equity market participants monitor index futures
                                     prior to the market open for an indication of the
                                     direction of cash market prices in early trading.
    B. Operational advantages        2. An issuer may wish to lock in its future debt
                                     costs in advance of the maturity of an outstanding
                                     debt issuance.
    C. Ability to allocate, trans-   3. Futures contracts in physical commodities
    fer, and manage risk             eliminate the need to directly transport, insure, and
                                     store a physical asset in order to take a position in
                                     its underlying price.
                                               ​




      Solution

      1. A is correct. Equity market participants monitoring index futures prior
         to the market open for an indication of the direction of cash market
         prices in early trading is an example of the derivatives price discovery
         function.
      2. C is correct. An issuer locking in its future debt costs in advance of the
         maturity of an outstanding debt issuance is an example of the ability to
         allocate, transfer, and manage risk.
      3. B is correct. Futures contracts in physical commodities eliminating the
         need to directly transport, insure, and store a physical asset in order to
         take a position in its underlying price is an example of the operational
         advantages of a derivative.

   4. Which of the following hedge accounting designations is appropriate for
      categorizing a corporate issuer’s use of an interest swap converting a float-
      ing-rate debt into a fixed-rate debt?
      A. Fair value hedge
      B. Cash flow hedge
       C. Net investment hedge
      Solution:
      B is correct. Cash flow hedge treatment is appropriate for instances in which
      a variable cash flow is converted to a fixed cash flow through the use of a de-
      rivative. A is incorrect because a fair value hedge is appropriate accounting
      treatment for derivative contracts that offset fluctuations in the fair value
      of the underlying. C is incorrect because a net investment hedge offsets the
      foreign currency risk of the value of a foreign subsidiary.




DERIVATIVE BENEFITS
                                                                                             2

56   Learning Module 3                                      Derivative Benefits, Risks, and Issuer and Investor Uses


                         Earlier lessons demonstrated how market participants use derivative instruments as
                         an alternative to cash markets to hedge or offset commercial risk as well as create or
                         modify exposure to the price of an underlying. We now take a more detailed look at
                         these and other benefits of the use of derivatives, while also considering several risks
                         unique to derivative instruments.
                             Derivative instruments provide users the opportunity to allocate, transfer, and/or
                         manage risk without trading an underlying. Cash or spot market prices for financial
                         instruments and commercial goods and services are a critical source of information
                         for the decision to buy or sell. However, in many instances, issuers and investors
                         face a timing difference between an economic decision and the ability to transact in
                         a cash market.
                             For example, issuers face the following timing differences when making operational
                         and financing decisions:
                            ■   A manufacturer may need to order commodity inputs for its production
                                process in advance of receiving finished-goods orders.
                            ■   A retailer may await a shipment of goods priced in a foreign currency before
                                selling domestic currency to make payment.
                            ■   An issuer may wish to lock in its future debt costs in advance of the matu-
                                rity of an outstanding debt issuance.
                            Investors may face similar timing issues when making portfolio decisions that are
                         separate from cash market transactions, as in the following cases:
                            ■   An investor may seek to capitalize on a market view but lack the necessary
                                cash on hand to transact in the spot market.
                            ■   In anticipation of a future stock dividend, debt coupon, or principal repay-
                                ment, an investor may decide today how it will reinvest the proceeds in the
                                future.
                             The ability to buy or sell a derivative instrument today at a pre-agreed price at a
                         future date can bridge the timing gap between an economic decision and the ability
                         to transact in underlying price risk under these scenarios. The use of forward com-
                         mitments or contingent claims to allocate or transfer risk across time and among
                         market participants able and willing to accept those exposures is a consistent theme
                         in derivative markets. Example 1 builds on an earlier illustration of how an issuer may
                         benefit from the use of a derivative associated with a commercial contract.

                         EXAMPLE 1

                           Foreign Exchange Risk Transfer of an Export Contract
                           Recall Montau AG, the German capital goods producer introduced earlier, which
                           signs a commercial contract with Jeon, Inc., a Korean manufacturer, to deliver
                           a laser cutting machine at a price of KRW650,000,000 in 75 days. Montau has
                           fixed domestic currency (EUR) costs and therefore faces a timing mismatch
                           between EUR costs incurred and EUR revenue realized upon the delivery of the
                           machine and sale of KRW received in exchange for EUR in the spot FX market.
                               Describe Montau’s currency exposure and how an FX forward contract may
                           be used to mitigate its FX price risk.
                               Montau will receive KRW in 75 days, which it must sell to cover its EUR
                           costs. This exposes the firm to KRW/EUR exchange rate changes for 75 days.
                           Specifically, if the KRW depreciates versus the EUR, Montau will be able to
Derivative Benefits                                                                       57


   purchase fewer EUR than expected with the KRW proceeds, resulting in a loss
   due to the FX timing mismatch. Montau’s exposure profile due to the mismatch
   is as follows:
                         Payoff/
                          Profit
                                                     Export contract
                                                        exposure
                                +

                                0                             (KRW/EUR)T

                                –



       In order to mitigate its export contract exposure, Montau enters an FX
   forward to sell KRW and purchase EUR at a fixed price [F0(T)] in 75 days to
   eliminate the KRW/EUR exchange rate mismatch arising from the export con-
   tract. The FX forward payoff and profit profile is as follows:
                         Payoff/
                          Profit
                                                            FX forward
                                                              profit
                                +

                                0                             (KRW/EUR)T

                                –            F0(T)



      The FX forward payoff and profit profile offsets Montau’s export contract
   exposure as a hedge, as shown in the following combined diagram:
                      Payoff/

    The ability to trade and/or manage risk using derivatives extends to the creation
of exposure profiles, which are unavailable in cash markets. The following example
combines a long cash position with a sold derivative to increase an investor’s expected
return, based on a specific market view.

EXAMPLE 2

   Covered Call Option Strategy
   South China Sprintwyck Investments (SCSI) has a Chinese equity portfolio that
   has outperformed in the first half of the year due to an overweight position in
   health care industry shares. SCSI holds a long position in the Shenzhen China
   Securities Index (CSI) 300 Health Care Index (CSI 300) traded on the China
   Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX). SCSI’s CIO expects volatility in the CSI

                         300 to decline and the CSI 300 price at year-end to be at or slightly above the
                         current spot price. Rather than sell the CSI 300 position today in the cash mar-
                         ket, she decides to sell a CSI 300 call option at an exercise price 5% above the
                         current spot market price for the remaining six months of the year.
                             Describe the difference in SCSI’s CSI 300 payoff profile between 1.) the long

                                    unexercised. SCSI’s profit equals the long CSI 300 position plus the
                                    call premium.

                                    cised. SCSI must pay the option buyer an amount equal to the gain
                                    on its long CSI 300 position above the exercise price. The option
                                    payoff is said to be “covered” by the long cash position. SCSI
                                    retains the call premium.

    Derivative instrument prices serve a price discovery function beyond the under-
lying cash or spot market. For example, futures prices are often seen as revealing
information about the direction of cash markets in the future, although they cannot
be strictly considered an unbiased forecast of future spot prices.
    Market participants often use futures prices to gauge the direction of cash markets
in the future in the following ways:
    ■    Equity market participants frequently monitor equity index futures prices
         prior to the stock market open for an indication of the direction of cash
         market prices in early trading.
    ■    Analysts often use interest rate futures markets to extract investor expec-
         tations of a central bank benchmark interest rate increase or decrease at a
         future meeting.
    ■    Commodity futures prices are a gauge of supply and demand dynamics
         between producers, consumers, and investors across maturities.
   Example 3 provides a case of supply and demand effects on futures prices.

EXAMPLE 3

   Negative Oil Futures Prices in 2020
   In April 2020, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures price fell
   below zero for the first time ever. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)
   WTI crude oil futures contract has an underlying of 1,000 barrels of crude oil
   delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, where energy companies store nearly 80 million
   barrels of oil. Widespread lockdowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic
   caused demand to plummet, while producers could not cut oil production
   quickly enough in anticipation of the severe decline. Oil inventory in Cushing
   skyrocketed as a result.

   As the May futures contract approached expiration in late April 2020, investors
   assuming the financial risk of oil prices were surprised as oil refiners avoided phys-
   ical delivery of oil upon contract settlement due to a sharp rise in storage costs.
   This forced the May futures price sharply lower, to a closing price of −USD37.63
   on 20 April 2020. Oil producers and refiners used this futures pricing information
   to adjust supply more quickly and reduce pressure on storage facilities.

                             The price discovery function of derivatives extends to contingent claims. As we
                         will see in a later lesson, option prices reflect several characteristics of the underlying,
                         including the expected price risk of the underlying, known as implied volatility. The
                         implied volatility of an option may be derived from its current price and other option
                         features and provides a measure of the general level of uncertainty in the price of the
                         underlying.
                             Derivative transactions offer a number of operational advantages to cash or spot
                         markets in many instances.
                            1. Transaction Costs: Commodity derivatives eliminate the need to transport,
                               insure, and store a physical asset in order to take a position in its underlying
                               price.
                            2. Increased Liquidity: Derivative markets typically have greater liquidity as a
                               result of the reduced capital required to trade derivatives versus an equiva-
                               lent cash position in an underlying.
                            3. Upfront Cash Requirements: Initial futures margin requirements and
                               option premiums are low relative to the cost of a cash market purchase.
                            4. Short Positions: In the absence of a liquid derivative market, taking a short
                               position involves the costly process of locating a cash owner willing to lend
                               the underlying for a period sufficient to facilitate a short sale.
                            Example 4 contrasts the cash outlay of a spot trade with a futures contract based
                         on transaction details familiar from an earlier lesson.

                         EXAMPLE 4

                            Purchase of Spot Gold versus a Gold Futures Contract
                            In an earlier example, Procam Investments enters a futures contract to buy 100
                            ounces of gold at a futures price [f0(T)] of USD1,792.13 per ounce that expires
                            in three months and must post USD4,950 in initial margin as required by the
                            exchange. The spot gold price (S0) at the time Procam enters the futures contract
                            is USD1,770 per ounce. Assume that Procam is able to borrow funds from a
                            financial intermediary at a rate of 5% per year. Contrast the expected opportu-
                            nity cost of the initial margin for the three-month futures contract with a cash
                            purchase of 100 ounces of gold for the same three-month period.

                                                      per ounce (S0)

      1. Procam borrows the USD4,950 initial margin from a financial interme-
         diary at 5% for three months.
      Opportunity (interest) cost of the initial margin:

      = (USD4,950 × .05)/4 = USD61.88

      2. Procam borrows USD177,000 (USD1,770 × 100 ounces) for the spot
         gold purchase from a financial intermediary at 5% for three months.
      Opportunity (interest) cost of the cash gold purchase price:

      = (USD177,000 × .05)/4 = USD2,212.50
       Procam gains exposure to the underlying price of 100 ounces of gold in the
   futures market at a fraction of the spot market cost. This comparison ignores
   three points about the futures contract and spot gold transactions:

      1. Procam’s margin requirements change as the futures price fluctuates
         between t = 0 and t = T. Specifically, Procam faces margin calls if a
         lower futures price causes its margin account balance to fall below
         the maintenance margin. However, as the underlying price is usually
         bounded by zero, it is unlikely that Procam’s borrowing cost for mar-
         gin will exceed that of the spot cash purchase.
      2. Procam’s spot gold purchase involves physical gold. It must therefore
         cover the cost of delivery, storage, and insurance for three months.
      3. The spot gold purchase takes place at a price of S0 = USD1,770 per
         ounce, while the pre-agreed futures price [f0(T)] = USD1,792.13 per
         ounce. At time T in three months, both the futures contract and the
         spot purchase result in a long position for Procam at a price of ST. The
         expected cost and return for these two transactions should therefore
         be equal, but the prices agreed at t = 0 are not. In a later lesson, we
         will explore the relationship between the spot gold price (S0) and the
         gold futures price [f0(T)] and the effect of both borrowing and storage
         costs.

    The operational efficiency of derivative markets also leads to greater market
efficiency. When prices deviate from fundamental values, derivative markets offer
less costly ways to exploit the mispricing. As noted earlier, less capital is required,

                         transaction costs are lower, and short selling is easier. As a result of these market fea-
                         tures, fundamental value is often reflected in derivative markets before it is restored
                         in the underlying cash market. The existence of derivative markets therefore often
                         causes financial markets in general to function more effectively. Exhibit 1 summarizes
                         derivative market benefits for market participants.

                            1. Describe a scenario in which an issuer faces a timing difference between
                               an economic decision and an ability to transact in cash markets to manage
                               price risk.
                               Solution:
                               An issuer may need to 1.) order commodity inputs for its production
                               process in advance of receiving finished-goods orders, 2.) await a shipment
                               of goods in a foreign currency before selling domestic currency to make
                               payment, or 3.) lock in its future debt costs in advance of the maturity of an
                               outstanding debt issuance.

                            2. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: Derivative markets typ-
                               ically have greater _________ than the underlying spot markets, a result of
                               the reduced _______ required to trade derivatives versus an equivalent cash
                               position in an underlying.
                               Solution:
                               Derivative markets typically have greater liquidity than the underlying spot
                               markets, a result of the reduced capital required to trade derivatives versus
                               an equivalent cash position in an underlying.

   3. Identify the proper derivative market benefits that correspond to the follow-
      ing statements:
                                             ​




    A. Price discovery function    1. Futures margin requirements are quite low versus
                                   the cost of a cash market purchase.
    B. Operational advantages      2. The ability to buy or sell a derivative today elim-
                                   inates the timing mismatch between an economic
                                   decision and the ability to transact.
    C. Risk transfer               3. Investors track an equity index futures price to
                                   gauge sentiment before the market opens.
                                             ​




      Solution:

       1. The correct answer is B. The low level of futures margin requirements
          versus the cost of a cash market purchase is an example of the opera-
          tional advantage of using derivatives.
       2. The correct answer is C. The ability to buy or sell a derivative contract
          today eliminates the timing mismatch between an economic decision
          and the ability to transact, which is an example of the risk transfer
          function of derivatives.
       3. The correct answer is A. Investors use derivatives in a price discovery

DERIVATIVE RISKS
                                                                                             3
               describe benefits and risks of derivative instruments

While derivatives offer benefits such as the ability to efficiently hedge, allocate, and/
or transfer risk as well as greater operational and market efficiency, the greater com-
plexity of derivative instruments and positions also gives rise to greater potential risks
associated with their use.
    The greater operational efficiency of derivative strategies that limit an investor’s
initial cash outlay translates to a high degree of implicit leverage versus a similar cash
market position. To illustrate this effect, we return to an earlier example to measure
and compare the leverage between a futures contract and a cash market purchase
with and without the use of borrowing.

EXAMPLE 5

   Implicit Leverage of Spot versus Futures Purchases
   In Example 4, we compared a spot purchase and a three-month futures contract
   purchase of 100 ounces of gold by Procam Investments.
       ■   Procam’s spot market purchase at S0 = USD1,770 per ounce results in
           a purchase price of USD177,000 (USD1,770 × 100) paid in cash.
64   Learning Module 3                                      Derivative Benefits, Risks, and Issuer and Investor Uses


                               ■   Procam’s three-month futures contract purchase at f0(T) =
                                   USD1,792.13 per ounce results in a purchase price of USD179,213
                                   (USD1,792.13 × 100). This purchase requires a USD4,950 initial mar-
                                   gin deposit at the exchange.
                               In three months, the spot gold price (ST) is USD1,780.50 per ounce, and
                           both the long cash position and the long futures contract position are valued
                           at USD178,050 (USD1,780.50 × 100). We divide the value change by the initial
                           cash outlay for each transaction to compare implicit leverages:
                               ■   Spot value change: 0.593% gain [(USD178,050 − USD177,000)/
                                   USD177,000].
                               ■   Futures value change: 23.5% loss [(USD178,050 − USD179,213)/
                                   USD4,950].
                               Note the large order-of-magnitude difference between the cash and futures
                           transactions. As mentioned earlier, we will explore the relationship between
                           borrowing costs, gold storage costs (ignored in this example), the spot gold
                           price (S0), and the gold futures price [f0(T)] in a later lesson.
                               Implicit leverage is further magnified in an extreme case where only borrowed
                           funds are used to enter the cash and futures transactions, as in Example 4:
                               ■   Spot value change versus borrowing cost: 47.5% gain [(USD178,050 −
                                   USD177,000)/ USD2,212.50].
                               ■   Futures value change versus borrowing cost: 1,879% loss [(USD178,050
                                   − USD179,213)/ USD61.88].
                               This example emphasizes a very important point about derivatives: their
                           inherent leverage magnifies the realized returns and risks and contributes to
                           the severity of derivative-related losses.
                               Procam gains exposure to USD177,000 in underlying gold price risk with just
                           USD61.88, implying a leverage ratio of 2,860. Procam benefits from this high
                           leverage as gold prices rise, but its losses are rapidly magnified as gold prices
                           decline. For example, as the futures price falls from USD179,213 to USD178,050,
                           the modest −0.649% gold price change translates to a loss of USD1,163. Procam’s
                           actual loss on this transaction is both the interest payment (USD61.88) and the
                           loss on the trade (USD1,163), for a total loss of USD1,224.88, nearly 20 times
                           (USD1,224.88/ USD61.88) the cost of financing.
                               The same principle holds for non-linear derivatives such as sold options,
                           where an option seller may face unlimited downside risk as underlying price
                           changes make it more favorable for an option buyer to exercise for a gain far in
                           excess of the premium paid.
                               Leverage in derivatives creates significant exposures for the counterparties
                           involved. These risks are mitigated through a combination of trading and exposure
                           risk management, daily marking to market, the use of collateral arrangements,
                           transaction and exposure limits, and centralized counterparties.

                             Derivatives offer the flexibility to create exposures beyond cash markets, which can
                         add significant portfolio complexity and involve risks that are not well understood by
                         stakeholders. This risk increases when a combination of derivatives and/or embedded
                         derivatives is involved. For example, structured notes are a broad category of secu-
                         rities that incorporate the features of debt instruments and one or more embedded
                         derivatives designed to achieve a particular issuer or investor objective. For instance,
Derivative Risks                                                                              65


structured notes designed to create a derivative-based payoff profile for individual
investors may involve greater cost, lower liquidity, and less transparency than an
equivalent stand-alone derivative instrument.
    Derivative users hedging commercial or financial exposure usually assume that a
derivative will be highly effective in offsetting the price risk of an underlying. However,
in some instances, the expected value of a derivative differs unexpectedly from that
of the underlying, in what is known as basis risk. Basis risk may arise if a derivative
instrument references a price or index that is similar to, but does not exactly match,
an underlying exposure such as a different market reference rate or an issuer CDS
spread versus that of an actual bond. Basis risk is affected by supply and demand
dynamics in derivative markets, among other factors.
    A related risk that can arise for both hedgers and risk takers is liquidity risk,
or a divergence in the cash flow timing of a derivative versus that of an underlying
transaction. The daily settlement of gains and losses in the futures market can give
rise to liquidity risk. If an investor or issuer using a futures contract to hedge an
underlying transaction is unable to meet a margin call due to a lack of funds, the
counterparty’s position is closed out and the investor or issuer must cover any losses
on the derivative trade.
    Counterparty credit risk is of critical importance to derivative market participants.
Unlike loan and bond markets, where credit exposures are predictably based on notional
outstanding plus accrued interest, daily swings in the price of an underlying, among
other factors affecting derivative prices, require more frequent exposure monitoring
and management. Counterparty credit exposure varies by the derivative type and
market in which a derivative is transacted. Exhibit 2 contrasts the counterparty credit
risk of a contingent claim with that of a forward commitment, using the example of
a purchased call option and a long forward position.

                         markets, credit terms privately arranged between counterparties vary from uncollat-

                             Broader derivatives use among market participants has increased the focus of
                         financial market supervisory authorities on the potential market-wide impact, or
                         systemic risk, associated with these instruments. Regulators continue to specifi-

                         financial intermediaries and a central counterparty (CCP), outlined earlier, include
                         margin provisions similar to futures in order to standardize and reduce counterparty

   2. Describe the counterparty credit risk faced by the seller of a call option.
      Solution:
      The seller of a call option receives an upfront premium in exchange for the
      right to purchase the underlying at the exercise price at maturity. Once the
      seller of a call option receives the premium from the option buyer, it has no
      further counterparty credit risk to the option buyer.

   3. Match these derivative market risks to the following statements:
                                                ​




    A. Liquidity risk       1. The risk that excessive risk taking and use of leverage in
                            derivative markets contribute to market stress
    B. Basis risk           2. The risk of a divergence in the cash flow timing of a deriv-
                            ative versus that of an underlying transaction
    C. Systemic risk        3. The risk that the expected value of a derivative differs
                            unexpectedly from that of the underlying
                                                ​




      Solution:

       1. The correct answer is C. Systemic risk involves excessive risk taking
          and use of leverage in derivative markets that contribute to market
          stress.
       2. The correct answer is A. Liquidity risk is the divergence in the cash
          flow timing of a derivative versus that of an underlying transaction.
       3. The correct answer is B. Basis risk involves the risk that the expected
          value of a derivative differs unexpectedly from that of an underlying.




ISSUER USE OF DERIVATIVES
                                                                                              4
               compare the use of derivatives among issuers and investors

Issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries use derivative instruments to increase,
decrease, or modify exposure to an underlying to meet their financial objectives.
Financial analysts must gain a deeper understanding of the various uses of deriva-
tives among market participants in order to interpret and replicate the wide range of
strategies encountered in practice.
     Non-financial corporate issuers often face risks to their assets, liabilities, and
earnings as a result of changes in the price of an underlying. For example, a corporate
issuer that uses a traded commodity in its operations will face greater earnings vola-
tility due to input price changes. The additional earnings volatility has the potential
to increase the corporate issuer’s cost of borrowing as well as to create difficulties for
investors to estimate its future corporate earnings. The impact of foreign exchange
volatility on corporate issuer earnings is illustrated by extending an earlier example.

                                Montau agrees to a KRW/EUR forward exchange rate [F0(T)] of 1,350 (i.e.,
                            1,350 KRW = 1 EUR), at which it will sell 650,000,000 KRW and receive 481,481

                                If Montau does not hedge its KRW/EUR exposure, its profit margin will
                            fluctuate based on the KRW/EUR spot rate when the machine is delivered. A
                            weaker KRW versus EUR results in a lower profit margin, while KRW appreci-
                            ation results in a higher profit margin.

                             Example 6 illustrates one of the most common derivative strategies used by cor-
                         porate issuers. The FX forward payoff offsets Montau’s income statement and cash
                         flow volatility due to currency changes.
                             Derivatives accounting has evolved from off-balance-sheet treatment to the
                         reporting of these instruments on the balance sheet at their fair market value. This
                         change aligns the recognition of derivative gains and losses with their designated risk
                         management purpose, increasing transparency and disclosure of derivatives use. Many
                         corporate issuers also establish risk management policies governing the objectives,
                         guidelines, risk limits, and internal approval processes associated with derivatives use.
                             Derivatives accounting standards specify that any derivative purchased or sold must
                         be marked to market through the income statement via earnings unless it is embedded
                         in an asset or liability or qualifies for hedge accounting. Hedge accounting allows an
                         issuer to offset a hedging instrument (usually a derivative) against a hedged transaction
                         or balance sheet item to reduce financial statement volatility. Categorizing derivatives
                         by hedge designation type sheds further light on both their intent and their expected
                         financial statement impact, to the benefit of financial analysts and stakeholders.
Issuer Use of Derivatives                                                                        69


    For example, derivatives designated as absorbing the variable cash flow of a
floating-rate asset or liability such as foreign exchange, interest rates, or commodities
are referred to as cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges may be either forward com-
mitments or contingent claims. For instance, the FX forward in Example 6 is a cash
flow hedge that offsets the variability of Montau’s functional currency (EUR) proceeds
from its commercial transaction in KRW. A swap to a fixed rate for a floating-rate
debt liability is another example of a cash flow hedge.
    A fair value hedge designation applies when a derivative is deemed to offset the
fluctuation in fair value of an asset or liability. For example, an issuer might convert
a fixed-rate bond issuance to a floating-rate obligation by entering into an interest
rate swap to receive a fixed rate and pay a market reference rate through the bond’s
maturity. Alternatively, a commodities producer might sell its inventory forward in
anticipation of lower future prices.
    Net investment hedges occur when either a foreign currency bond or a derivative
such as an FX swap or forward is used to offset the exchange rate risk of the equity of
a foreign operation. Exhibit 4 summarizes these hedge designations.

                       operation

Hedge accounting treatment for derivatives is highly desirable for corporate issuers,
as it allows them to recognize derivative gains and losses at the same time as the
associated underlying hedged transaction. Derivative mark-to-market changes are
held within an equity account (Other Comprehensive Income) and released at the
same time the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.
    In order to qualify for this treatment, the dates, notional amounts, and other con-
tract features of a derivative must closely match those of the underlying transaction.
For this reason, issuers are far more likely to use OTC markets to create customized
hedges to meet their specific needs. For example, Montau AG would face earnings
volatility from the derivative position if it were to use a standardized two-month for-
eign exchange futures contract rather than the 75-day over-the-counter FX forward
contract with a financial intermediary, as in Example 6.

                              Hedge accounting allows an issuer to offset a hedging instrument (usually
                              a derivative) against a hedged transaction or balance sheet item to reduce
                              financial statement volatility.

             5           INVESTOR USE OF DERIVATIVES

                                       compare the use of derivatives among issuers and investors

                         Issuers predominantly use derivatives to offset or hedge market-based underlying
                         exposures incidental to their commercial operations and financing activities. In
                         contrast, investors use derivatives to replicate a cash market strategy, hedge a fund’s
                         value against adverse movements in underlyings, or modify or add exposures using
                         derivatives, which in some cases are unavailable in cash markets.
Investor Use of Derivatives                                                                    71


    The greater liquidity and reduced capital required to trade derivatives may lead an
investor to replicate a desired position using a derivative rather than cash. Alternatively,
derivative hedges enable investors to isolate certain underlying exposures in the
investment process while retaining a position in others. One example is the use of FX
hedges when investing overseas in order to minimize the volatility of return due to
currency fluctuations. Finally, the flexibility to take short positions or to increase or
otherwise modify exposure using derivatives beyond cash alternatives is an attractive
feature for portfolio managers targeting excess returns by using a variety of strategies.
    An investment fund’s prospectus typically specifies which derivative instruments
may be used within a fund and for which purpose.
    Several examples in earlier lessons illustrated the use of derivatives from an investor
perspective using both forward commitments and contingent claims.

Forward Commitments

    ■    Recall an earlier example in which Procam Investments purchased a three-
         month gold forward or futures contract. The derivatives contract increased
         Procam’s exposure to the underlying price of gold in the future with no
         initial cash outlay and no requirement to take immediate delivery of the
         physical asset, as in the case of a cash purchase.
    ■    In the example of Fyleton Investments, the fund entered into a GBP interest
         rate swap to increase the duration of its assets with no initial cash outlay.


Contingent Claims

    ■    One example had Hightest Capital purchasing a call option to benefit from
         an expected increase in a health care stock index price above the exercise in
         exchange for an upfront premium.
    ■    The SCSI long equity and short call (or covered call) example created an
         exposure profile under which SCSI realized a higher return than in its orig-
         inal long cash position if the underlying index price at the end of the year
         was stable to slightly higher, in accordance with the CIO’s view.
    In these and other instances throughout the curriculum, we find investors to be
less focused than issuers on hedge accounting treatment, as an investment fund’s
derivative position is typically marked to market each day and included in the daily
net asset value (NAV) of the portfolio or fund. This also explains why investors tend to
transact more frequently in standardized and highly liquid exchange-traded derivative
markets than do issuers.

                           The purpose of investor derivatives use within a fund is usually to modify
                           the fund’s exposure to increase the return of the fund under specific market
                           conditions and/or to offset or hedge the fund’s value against adverse move-
                           ments in underlyings, such as exchange rates, interest rates, and securities
                           markets.

   As a financial analyst for a wealth management advisory firm, you have been
   tasked with comparing the features of the Baywhite Financial LLC Structured
   Note with those of a similar exchange-traded, stand-alone derivative instrument
   alternative in order to make a recommendation to the firm’s clients.

1. Which of the following statements best describes the derivative instrument that
   is embedded in the Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note?
   A. The Structured Note has an embedded long futures contract with the S&P
      500 Health Care Select Sector Index (SIXV) as an underlying.

   B. The Structured Note has an embedded long call option contract with the
      S&P 500 Health Care Select Sector Index (SIXV) as an underlying.

   C. The Structured Note has an embedded short put option contract with the
      S&P 500 Health Care Select Sector Index (SIXV) as an underlying.

2. Which of the following statements best contrasts the credit risk of the Baywhite
   Financial LLC Structured Note with the counterparty credit risk of an investor

                            entering into the embedded exchange-traded derivative on a stand-alone basis?
                            A. An investor in the Baywhite Structured Note assumes the credit risk of
                               Baywhite Financial LLC for 20% of the note’s face value, as the remaining
                               80% is principal protected. An investor entering into the SIXV derivative
                               on a stand-alone basis assumes the counterparty credit risk of a financial
                               intermediary.

                            B. An investor in the Baywhite Structured Note assumes the credit risk of
                               Baywhite Financial LLC for 80% of the note’s face value, as the remaining
                               20% is associated with the embedded derivative. An investor entering into
                               the SIXV derivative on a stand-alone basis assumes the counterparty credit
                               risk of a financial intermediary.

                            C. An investor in the Baywhite Structured Note assumes the credit risk of
                               Baywhite Financial LLC for 100% of the note’s face value, while an investor
                               entering into the SIXV derivative on a stand-alone basis assumes the coun-
                               terparty credit risk of an exchange and its clearinghouse.

                         3. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the liquidity of
                            the Baywhite Structured Note versus that of the embedded exchange-traded
                            derivative?
                            A. The Baywhite Structured Note is likely to be more liquid than the
                               stand-alone SIXV call option, as the Note has 80% principal protection
                               while an investor in the stand-alone derivative may lose the entire option
                               premium if it expires worthless at maturity.

                            B. The Baywhite Structured Note is likely to be more liquid than the
                               stand-alone SIXV call option, as the Note is priced at a stated 2% premium
                               above par while an investor in the stand-alone derivative faces the lack of
                               transparency as well as basis, liquidity, and counterparty credit risks associ-
                               ated with derivative transactions.

                            C. Structured notes such as the Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note
                               often involve greater cost, lower liquidity, and less transparency than an
                               equivalent stand-alone derivative instrument, while the exchange-traded
                               SIXV derivative contract is standardized and trades in a liquid, transparent
                               market.

                         4. Which of the following statements best describes how an investor should evalu-
                            ate the terms of the Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note as compared with
                            the stand-alone derivative price in order to make a recommendation?
                            A. The Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note issuance price of 2% above par
                               value should be compared with the upfront premium for a six-month SIXV
                               call option with an exercise price at 5% above the current SIXV spot price.

                            B. The Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note 20% Principal at Risk should
                               be compared with the upfront premium for a six-month SIXV call option
                               with an exercise price at 5% above the current SIXV spot price.

                            C. The Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note issuance price of 2% above par
                               value plus the 20% Principal at Risk should be compared with the upfront
                               premium for a six-month SIXV call option with an exercise price at 5%
                               above the current SIXV spot price.
Solutions                                                                                   75




   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. The Structured Note is linked to the performance of the S&P 500
   Health Care Select Sector Index (SIXV). Note that the SIXV derivative is similar
   to that in the earlier SCSI CSI 300 example. The “Additional Amount” paid at
   maturity is equal to the greater of 100% of the returns on the S&P 500 Health
   Care Select Sector Index (SIXV) in excess of 5% above the current spot price of
   the SIXV or zero. This payoff profile [Max (0, ST – X)] is identical to that of a pur-
   chased six-month SIXV call option with an exercise price (X) at 5% above today’s
   SIXV spot price.

2. C is correct. The investor assumes the credit risk of Baywhite Financial LLC
   for the full value of the structured note as the structured note issuer. Under the
   purchased exchange-traded SIXV call option, the investor faces the risk of the ex-
   change and its clearinghouse, which provides a guarantee of contract settlement
   backed by the exchange insurance fund.

3. C is correct. The Structured Note is likely to be far less liquid than the
   stand-alone SIXV call option, which is traded on a derivatives exchange. Re-
   call from an earlier lesson that exchange-traded contracts are more formal and
   standardized, which facilitates a more liquid and transparent market. Note also
   that the Baywhite Financial LLC Structured Note is issued at 102% of face value,
   suggesting that an investor will likely forgo this premium if selling the note prior
   to maturity.

4. C is correct. The 20% Principal at Risk, or USD200 of Face Value for each
   USD1,000 (the minimum denomination), combined with the 2% (or USD20)
   issue premium, should be compared with the upfront premium for a six-month
   SIXV call option with an exercise price at 5% above the current SIXV spot price.
   The comparison should also consider the additional credit risk and liquidity risk
   of the Structured Note versus the exchange-traded option.

INTRODUCTION
Earlier derivative lessons established the features of derivative instruments and markets
                                                                                            1
and addressed both the benefits and risks associated with their use. Forward com-
mitments and contingent claims were distinguished by their different payoff profiles
and other characteristics. We now turn our attention to the pricing and valuation of
these instruments. As a first step, we explore how the price of a forward commitment
is related to the spot price of an underlying asset in a way that does not allow for
arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, the strategy of replication shows that identical
payoffs to a forward commitment can be achieved from spot market transactions
combined with borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, the second lesson
demonstrates how costs or benefits associated with owning an underlying asset affect
the forward commitment price.

                             ■   The risk-free rate provides a fundamental link between spot and for-
                                 ward prices for underlying assets with no additional costs or benefits
                                 of ownership.
                             ■   The cost of carry is the net of the costs and benefits related to owning
                                 an underlying asset for a specific period and must be factored into
                                 the difference between the spot price and a forward price of a specific
                                 underlying asset.
                             ■   The cost of carry may include costs, such as storage and insurance for
                                 physical commodities, or benefits of ownership, such as dividends for
                                 stocks and interest for bonds. Foreign exchange represents a special
                                 case in which the cost of carry is the interest rate differential between
                                 two currencies.
                             ■   Forward prices may be greater than or less than the underlying spot
                                 price, depending on the specific cost of carry associated with owning
                                 the underlying asset.



                         LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                          These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                          of understanding of this learning module.

                          1. Which of the following statements correctly describes how to replicate a
                             long forward position?
                             A. Sell a risk-free bond, and buy a cash market position in the underlying.
                             B. Buy a risk-free bond, and buy a cash market position in the
                                underlying.
                             C. Buy a risk-free bond, and sell a cash market position in the underlying.
                            Solution:
                            A is correct. Selling a risk-free bond provides the necessary cash to buy the
                            underlying in the cash market. At the bond’s maturity, the underlying is
                            sold at the future spot price, and the proceeds are used to pay off the bond.
                            The profit on this transaction is dependent on the future spot price of the
                            underlying compared to the underlying cash market price multiplied by one
                            plus the risk-free rate, and this profit position is identical to that of a long
                            forward position in the underlying. B is incorrect because buying the risk-
                            free bond creates a need for cash in addition to buying the underlying in the
                            cash market. C is incorrect because this combination would replicate a short
                            forward position.

                          2. Which of the following is closest to the arbitrage profit available to an
                             investor who is able to buy an asset for a spot price of GBP50 at t = 0 and
                             simultaneously sell a six-month forward commitment on the same asset at a
                             forward price of GBP52.50? The risk-free rate of interest is 4%, and the asset
                             has no additional costs or benefits.
                             A. GBP0.99
                             B. GBP0.48
Introduction                                                                           79


      C. GBP1.51
     Solution:
     C is correct. The investor borrows at 4% for six months to buy the asset to-
     day for GBP50. After six months, the investor pays the lender S0(1 + r)T, or
     GBP50.99 [= GBP50(1.04)0.5] in principal and interest and delivers the asset
     to satisfy the forward commitment to sell at GBP52.50. The investor’s ar-
     bitrage profit is GBP1.51 (= GBP52.50 – GBP50.99). A is incorrect because
     this answer reflects the difference between the no-arbitrage forward price
     and the current spot price. B is incorrect because this answer reflects the
     difference between the forward price discounted back one year (rather than
     six months) and the current spot price.

  3. Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship be-
     tween a forward commitment price compared to the underlying spot price
     when the benefits of owning the underlying are greater than the costs of
     owning the underlying (including the opportunity interest costs)?
      A. Forward commitment price > spot price.
      B. Forward commitment price < spot price.
      C. Forward commitment price = spot price.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Greater benefits associated with the underlying will be associat-
     ed with a higher spot price relative to the forward commitment price, and if
     these benefits are greater than the costs of owning the underlying, then the
     spot price will be greater than the forward commitment price. A is incorrect
     because this inequality would be true in the case of the costs exceeding the
     benefits. C is incorrect because an equality between the two prices describes
     the rare circumstance in which costs and benefits are exactly equal.

  4. Which of the following statements best defines a convenience yield?
      A. Convenience yield reflects the preference that market participants
         exhibit for buying forward contracts to avoid having to pay cash up
         front.
      B. Convenience yield reflects the preference that market participants
         exhibit for buying in the spot market to avoid having to pay for
         storage.
      C. Convenience yield reflects the preference that market participants
         exhibit for buying in the spot market for non-cash reasons, including
         low inventories in the underlying cash market.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The convenience yield is a non-cash benefit associated with
     owning an underlying physical commodity that arises under certain eco-
     nomic conditions, including low inventories of the underlying. A is incorrect
     because the statement suggests convenience yield is a cost of owning the
     underlying. B is incorrect because the statement is contradictory in that it
     states that convenience yield causes market participants to prefer spot mar-
     kets but incorrectly attributes this to a cost of owning the underlying.

             2           ARBITRAGE

                                              explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in
                                              pricing derivatives

                         An earlier lesson on market efficiency established that market prices should not allow
                         for the possibility of riskless profit or arbitrage in the absence of transaction costs. In
                         its simplest form, an arbitrage opportunity arises if the “law of one price” does not
                         hold, or an identical asset trades at the same time at different prices in different places.
                              In the case of a derivative contract whose value is derived from future cash flows
                         associated with the price of an underlying asset, arbitrage opportunities arise either if
                         two assets with identical future cash flows trade at different prices or if an asset with a
                         known future price does not trade at the present value of its future price determined
                         using an appropriate discount rate.
                              The first case of assets with identical future cash flows trading at different prices
                         is illustrated in Exhibit 1.



                           Exhibit 1: Assets with Identical Future Cash Flows Trade at

                         For example, assume the two assets are zero-coupon bonds with identical features
                         and the same issuer. Both bonds mature on the same future date with a payoff of par
                         and have the same risk of default between now and the maturity date.
                            1. Bond A has a price of EUR99 at time t = 0 (S0A = EUR99).
                            2. Bond B has a price of EUR99.15 at time t = 0 (S0B = EUR99.15).
                            3. Both bonds have an expected future price of EUR100 (STA = STB = EUR100).
                            This scenario represents an arbitrage opportunity for an investor.
                             ■   At time t = 0, the investor can:

                                 ●       Sell Bond B short to receive proceeds of EUR99.15 and purchase Bond A
                                         for EUR99;
                                 ●       Realize a net cash inflow at t = 0 of EUR0.15.
                             ■   At time t = T, when both bonds mature, the investor:

                                 ●       Receives EUR100 for Bond A and uses this to buy Bond B for EUR100 to
                                         cover the short position.
                                 ●       The offsetting cash flows at time T leave the investor with a riskless
                                         profit of the EUR0.15 price difference between Bonds A and B at time 0.
Arbitrage                                                                                                                         81


    Other investors taking note of this discrepancy will also seek to earn a riskless
profit at time t = 0 by selling Bond B, driving its price down, and buying Bond A,
driving its price up, until the prices converge. The arbitrage opportunity disappears
once the bonds have the same price (S0A = S0B).
    A second type of derivative-related arbitrage opportunity arises when an asset with
a known future price does not trade at the present value (PV) of its future price. An
earlier time-value-of-money lesson distinguished between discrete and continuous
compounding in calculating present versus future value. The future value of a single
cash flow based on a discrete number of uniform periods follows the general formula
in Equation 1:
   FVN = PV(1 + r)N,                                                                                                        (1)
    where r is the stated interest rate per period and N is the number of compound-
ing periods. Continuous compounding is the case in which the length of the uniform
periods approaches zero, so the number of periods per year approaches infinity and
is calculated using the natural logarithm, as shown in Equation 2:
   FVT = PVerT.                                                                                                             (2)
While derivatives may be priced with either approach, for purposes of this and later
lessons, we will use the discrete compounding method for individual underlying
assets. However, for underlying assets that represent a portfolio, such as an equity,
fixed-income, commodity, or credit index, or where the underlying involves foreign
exchange where interest rates are denominated in two currencies, continuous com-
pounding will be the preferred method. Ignoring additional costs or benefits asso-
ciated with asset ownership, the appropriate discount rate, r, is the risk-free rate, as
demonstrated in Example 1.

EXAMPLE 1

  Spot vs. Discounted Known Future Price of Gold
  In an earlier lesson, Procam Investments entered into a contract to buy 100
  ounces of gold at an agreed-upon price of USD1,792.13 per ounce in three
  months. In this example, Procam does the opposite trade, given a discrepancy
  between spot and discounted known future gold prices. Assume that today’s
  spot gold price (S0) is USD1,770 per ounce, and the annualized risk-free interest
  rate (r) is 2%. For purposes of this example, we assume that Procam can borrow
  at the risk-free rate and gold may be stored at no cost. Under these conditions,
  we demonstrate how Procam can generate a riskless profit:
      ■     At time t = 0:
      ■     Procam borrows USD177,000 at 2.0% interest for three months and
            purchases 100 ounces of gold at today’s spot price.
      ■     Procam enters into a forward contract today to sell 100 ounces of gold
            at a price of USD1,792.13 per ounce in three months.
                     S0 < ST (1 + r)–T                                              S0(1 + r)T < ST
      Borrow S0 at r and Buy S0, Agree to sell at ST                        Sell at ST and Repay S0(1 + r)T
       Borrow USD1,770 at 2% and Buy gold (S0)                Sell at USD1,792.13 (ST) and Repay S0(1 + r)T = USD1,778.78
     Contract to sell at ST = USD1,792.13 per ounce                     Riskless profit of USD13.35 per ounce
                         CF0 = 0                                           CFT = (USD1,792.13 – USD1,778.78) > 0

      ■     At time t = T (in three months):
82   Learning Module 4                                 Arbitrage, Replication, and the Cost of Carry in Pricing Derivatives


                                     ■   Procam delivers 100 ounces of gold under the forward contract and
                                         receives USD179,213 (= 100 × USD1,792.13).
                                     ■   Procam repays the loan principal with interest:

                                     USD177,878.44 = USD177,000(1.02)0.25.

                                     ■   Procam’s riskless profit at time T is equal to the difference between
                                         the forward sale proceeds and the loan principal and interest:
                                         USD1,334.56 = USD179,213 – USD177,878.44.

                              In Example 1, the spot price of gold, S0, is below the present value of the known
                         future price of gold in three months’ time (S0 < ST(1 + r) –T, since USD1,770 <
                         USD1,783.28). Procam earns a riskless profit of USD13.35 per ounce by borrowing
                         and purchasing gold in the cash market and simultaneously selling gold in the forward
                         market at an agreed-upon price. We would expect that as other investors recognize
                         and pursue this opportunity, the spot price will increase (and the forward price will
                         fall) until the spot price is equal to the discounted value of the known future price
                         (S0 = ST(1 + r)–T) to eliminate this arbitrage opportunity.
                              The two key arbitrage concepts used to price derivatives for an underlying with
                         no additional cash flows may be summarized as follows:
                             ■       Identical assets or assets with identical cash flows traded at the same time
                                     must have the same price (S0A = S0B).
                             ■       Assets with a known future price must have a spot price that equals the
                                     future price discounted at the risk-free rate (S0 = ST(1 + r)–T).
                            These arbitrage conditions establish the relationship between spot prices, forward
                         commitment prices, and the risk-free rate shown in Exhibit 2.

                         Exhibit 2 shows the case of r > 0 for an asset with no additional income or costs under
                         discrete compounding. Note that for a given time T, the forward price will be higher
                         relative to the spot price with a higher risk-free rate r. Also, for a given risk-free
                         rate r, as T increases, the forward price will increase relative to the spot price. It is
                         important to note that the relevant risk-free rate for most market participants is the
                         repo rate, introduced in an earlier lesson, where borrowed funds are collateralized
                         by highly liquid securities.
                             Recall from an earlier lesson that a forward commitment has a symmetric payoff
                         profile. That is, at time T, the transaction is settled on the basis of the difference
                         between the forward price F0(T) and the underlying price of ST, or F0(T) – ST from
                         the seller’s perspective, as in Exhibit 3.

The forward seller realizes a gain if the seller is able to deliver the underlying at a
market value (ST) below the pre-agreed price, F0(T). In Example 1, Procam borrows
to buy the underlying at a spot price below the present value of ST to lock in a risk-
less gain. So far, we have taken the forward price, F0(T), as given. In what follows, we
demonstrate how no-arbitrage conditions may be used to establish the relationship
between spot and forward prices by replicating or recreating an exact offsetting posi-
tion for a forward commitment.




REPLICATION
                                                                                           3
              explain how the concepts of arbitrage and replication are used in
              pricing derivatives

Replication is a strategy in which a derivative’s cash flow stream may be recreated
using a combination of long or short positions in an underlying asset and borrowing
or lending cash. In contrast to the earlier arbitrage examples, replication is typically
used to mirror or offset a derivative position when the law of one price holds and no
riskless arbitrage profit opportunities exist. For example, Exhibit 4 compares a long
forward commitment to the alternative of borrowing funds at the risk-free rate, r, to
buy the underlying asset at today’s spot price, S0.

                          Replication of a Forward Commitment
                          In Example 1, we reintroduced Procam Investments, which borrowed and
                          purchased gold in the spot market and simultaneously sold gold in the forward
                          market to earn a riskless profit. Here we change the assumption about today’s
                          spot gold price (S0). Specifically, the spot gold price has risen to USD1,783.28
                          (= USD1,792.13(1.02)–0.25) to eliminate the earlier arbitrage opportunity when
                          the spot price was USD1,770. Assume again that the risk-free interest rate (r)
                          is 2% and gold can be stored at no cost.

                              1. Long forward commitment (agree to buy at F0(T) at t = T)
                                    ●   Procam enters a forward commitment to buy 100 ounces of gold in
                                        three months at a forward price, F0(T), of USD1,792.13 per ounce.
                                    ●   If ST = USD1,900 per ounce,
                                    ■   Profit = USD10,787 = 100 × (USD1,900 – USD1,792.13).
                                    ●   If ST = USD1,700 per ounce,
                                    ■   Profit = –USD9,213 = 100 × (USD1,700 –USD1,792.13).
                              2. Borrow and purchase (borrow S0 and buy asset at S0 at t = 0):
                                    ●   Procam borrows USD178,328 at 2% and buys 100 ounces of gold at
                                        today’s spot price, S0.
                                    ●   Procam sells the gold in three months at spot price ST.
                                    ●   Procam repays the loan principal and interest: USD179,213 =

                                    ■   Profit = USD10,787 = 100 × (USD1,900 – USD1,792.13).
                                    ●   If ST = USD1,700,
                                    ■   Profit = –USD9,213 = 100 × (USD1,700 – USD1,792.13).

       Note that the same profits are observed under Scenarios 1 and 2, which are
   equal to ST – F0(T). If we set the forward price, F0(T), equal to the future value
   of the spot rate using the risk-free rate (F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T), the no-arbitrage
   condition demonstrates that Procam generates the same cash flow at time T
   regardless of the direction of gold prices whether the company

      1. enters into a long forward commitment settled at time T or
      2. borrows at the risk-free rate, buys the underlying asset, and holds it
         until time T.

    A separate but related form of replication pairing a long asset with a short forward
is shown in Exhibit 5. The top half shows the profit/loss profile of the long asset, and
the bottom half shows that of the short forward position. The long asset position
produces a profit (loss) when ST > S0 (ST < S0). The short forward position produces
a profit (loss) when ST < F0 (ST > F0).

                         EXAMPLE 3

                            Risk-Free Trade Replication: Long Asset, Short Forward
                            Procam Investments buys 100 ounces of gold at today’s spot price (S0) of
                            USD1,783.28 and simultaneously enters a forward commitment to sell gold at
                            the forward price, F0(T), of USD1,792.13. Again, we assume that gold can be
                            stored at no cost, and here we solve for Procam’s rate of return.
                                ■   At t = 0, Procam’s cash flow is –S0 = –USD178,328.
                                ■   At t = T, Procam’s cash flow is F0(T) = USD179,213.
                                ■   Solve for the rate of return on Procam’s strategy, as follows:

                                    ●   USD179,213 = USD178,328(1 + r)0.25.
                                    ● r = 2.0%, which is equal to the risk-free rate.
                                This example demonstrates that Procam can hedge its long gold cash position
                            with a short derivative (i.e., selling the forward contract) and earn the risk-free
                            rate of return as long as the no-arbitrage condition (F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T) holds.
                            The combined return is shown in Exhibit 6. Note that if Procam borrows at the
                            risk-free rate to purchase the underlying asset at S0, it will earn zero.

                         Because the forward price is assumed to be greater than the spot price in this example
                         and r is positive, the risk-free profit is a positive amount and is the same (i.e., risk free)
                         regardless of the price of the underlying (i.e., ST). As we will see in the next lesson,
                         there may be benefits or costs to owning an underlying asset that cause the risk-free
                         return in Exhibit 6 to differ from F0(T) – S0 and possibly even be negative.

QUESTION SET

   Arbitrage and Replication

   1. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: If the law of one price
      does not hold, a(n) _________ asset trades at the same time at _________
      prices in different places.
      Solution:
      If the law of one price does not hold, a(n) identical asset trades at the same
      time at different prices in different places.

   2. An investor observes that the spot price, S0, of an underlying asset with no
      additional costs or benefits exceeds its known future price discounted at
      the risk-free rate, ST(1 + r)–T. Describe and justify an arbitrage strategy that
      generates a riskless profit for the investor.
      Solution:
      Since the spot price of the underlying asset exceeds the known future price
      discounted at the risk-free rate (S0 > F0(T)(1 + r)–T), at t = 0, the investor:
      • Sells the underlying asset short in the spot market at S0
      • Simultaneously enters a long forward contract at F0(T)
      • Lends S0 at the risk-free rate r to receive S0(1 + r)T at time T.
      At time t = T, the investor:
      • Settles the long forward position and receives ST – F0(T)
      • Offsets the short underlying asset position at ST, and
      • Retains S0(1 + r)T – F0(T) as a riskless profit regardless of the underlying
      spot price at time T.

   3. Formulate a replication strategy for a three-month short forward commit-
      ment for 1,000 shares of a non-dividend-paying stock.
      Solution:
      The replication strategy for a three-month short forward commitment on a
      non-dividend-paying stock involves the short sale of 1,000 shares of stock
      at t = 0 and investment of proceeds at the risk-free rate, r. At time t = T, the
      short sale is covered at ST, and under the no-arbitrage condition of F0(T) =
      S0(1 + r)T, the return is equal to F0(T) – ST for both the short forward and
      the replication strategy.

   4. Calculate the arbitrage profit if a spot asset with no additional costs or
      benefits trades at a spot price of 100, the three-month forward price for the
      underlying asset is 102, and the risk-free rate is 5%.
      Solution:
      The forward price, F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T, at which no-arbitrage opportunities
      would exist is 101.23 (= 100(1.05)0.25). With an observed forward price of
      102, the arbitrage opportunity would be to sell the forward contract and buy
      the underlying, borrowing at the risk-free rate to fund the purchase. The
      arbitrage profit is the difference between the observed forward price and the
      no-arbitrage forward price of 0.77 (= 102 – 101.23).

                           5. Describe the relationship between the spot and forward price for an under-
                              lying asset if the risk-free rate is negative.
                              Solution:
                              The relationship between the spot and forward rate for an asset with no
                              additional costs or benefits of ownership other than the opportunity cost
                              (risk-free rate) is equal to F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T. In a case where r < 0, (1 + r)T
                              < 1 and therefore the forward price, F0(T), is below the spot price, S0, if the
                              risk-free rate is negative.




             4           COSTS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNING
                         THE UNDERLYING

                                       explain the difference between the spot and expected future price
                                       of an underlying and the cost of carry associated with holding the
                                       underlying asset

                         In the prior lesson, replication was used to illustrate the basic relationship between
                         entering into a spot transaction versus a forward commitment. The linkage between
                         the spot price of an asset with no associated cash flows and a forward commitment
                         on the same asset was shown to be the risk-free rate of interest, r. In this lesson, we
                         discuss cost of carry as the net of the costs and benefits related to owning an under-
                         lying asset for a specific period.
                             In the forward commitment example from the prior lesson, where no costs or
                         benefits were associated with the underlying asset, the following relationship between
                         the spot and forward prices was established:
                            F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T.                                                                 (3)
                         This relationship is shown under continuous compounding in Equation 4:
                            F0(T) = S0erT.                                                                      (4)
                         The risk-free rate, r, denotes the opportunity cost of holding (“carrying”) the asset,
                         whether or not the long investor borrows to finance the asset. This opportunity cost
                         is present for all asset classes discussed below.
                             Equations 3 and 4 represent the special case of an underlying asset with no addi-
                         tional associated cash flows. However, many assets have additional costs or benefits
                         of ownership that must be reflected in the forward commitment price in order to
                         prevent riskless arbitrage opportunities from arising between underlying spot and
                         derivative prices. Exhibit 7 demonstrates the effect of costs and benefits (usually div-
                         idend or interest income) on the spot price, forward commitment price, and risk-free
                         rate relationships.

                                                                               Benefit > Cost

                                                                           F0–(T)

If an underlying asset owner incurs costs in addition to the opportunity cost, she
should expect to be compensated for these added costs through a higher forward price,
F0+(T). Income or other benefits accrue to the underlying asset owner and therefore
should reduce the forward price to F0–(T).
    For underlying assets with ownership benefits or income (I) or costs (C) expressed
as a known amount in present value terms at t = 0—shown as PV0()—the relationship
between spot and forward prices in discrete compounding terms can be shown as
   F0(T) = [S0 – PV0(I) + PV0(C)](1 + r)T.                                                (5)
In other instances, the additional costs or benefits are expressed as a rate of return
over the life of the contract. For income (i) and cost (c) expressed as rates of return,
the relationship between spot and forward prices under continuous compounding is
   F0(T) = S0e(r+c–i)T.                                                                   (6)
Whether expressed as a known amount in present value terms or as a rate of return,
the forward price must incorporate the net effect of all costs and benefits associated
with owning the underlying asset, including the following.
   ■       Opportunity cost (risk-free interest rate, r): A positive risk-free rate
           causes a forward price to be greater than the underlying spot price, all else
           equal, and the higher the risk-free rate, the greater the positive difference
           between the two. This opportunity cost applies to any asset.
   ■       Other costs of ownership (C, c): Owners of some underlying assets, such as
           physical commodities, must incur storage, transportation, insurance, and/or
           spoilage costs. An owner entering a contract for future delivery will expect
           to be compensated for these costs, resulting in a forward price that is there-
           fore greater than the underlying spot price, all else equal.
   ■       Benefits of ownership (I, i): Alternatively, the owners of some underlying
           assets enjoy cash flow or other benefits associated with owning the under-
           lying asset as opposed to a derivative on the asset. A counterparty entering
           a derivative contract for future delivery of an underlying asset forgoes these
           benefits and will therefore reduce the forward price by this amount. Stock
           dividends or bond coupons are examples of cash flow benefits.
    Exhibit 8 illustrates the relationship between forward and spot prices in the pres-
ence of costs and benefits. For example, when the opportunity cost and other costs
of ownership exceed the benefits, the forward price will be above the underlying spot
asset price.

                         Opportunity and Other Cost < Benefit                                 F0(T) < S0

                         Each underlying asset type has different costs and benefits, which may vary over time
                         and across markets. For example, owners of some individual equity securities receive
                         the benefit of regular stock dividends, as in Example 4, while others do not. For equity
                         indexes, the benefit is usually expressed as a rate of return, as shown in Example 5.

                            (I = 0), and assume a risk-free rate (r) of 5%. We may use Equation 3 to solve

                               F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T.

                               EUR51.23 = EUR50(1.05)0.5.
                            Now assume instead that Unilever pays a quarterly dividend of EUR0.30, which
                            occurs in exactly three months and again at time T, with other details unchanged.
                            Use Equation 5 with PV0(C) = 0 to solve for F0(T) in six months:
                               F0(T) = [S0 – PV0(I)](1 + r)T.
                            First, solve for the present value of the dividend per share, PV0(I), as follows:
                               PV0(I) = EUR0.30(1.05)–0.25 + EUR0.30(1.05)–0.5.

                               EUR0.5892 = 0.2964 + 0.2928.

                               Substitute PV0(I) = EUR0.5892 into Equation 5 to solve for F0(T):

                               F0(T) = (EUR50 – EUR0.5892)(1.05)0.5

                               = EUR50.6310.
                            Hightest’s forward contract for 1,000 UL shares would therefore be priced at
                            EUR50,631.00 (= 1,000 × EUR50.6310). The opportunity cost of borrowing at the
                            risk-free rate is EUR1.23 per share for six months and equals F0(T) – S0 when
                            Unilever pays no dividend. A EUR0.30 quarterly dividend reduces the difference
                            between the forward and spot price to approximately EUR0.63.

EXAMPLE 5

   Stock Index Futures with Dividend Yield
   The Viswan Family Office (VFO) would like to enter into a three-month forward
   commitment contract to purchase the NIFTY 50 benchmark Indian stock market
   index traded on the National Stock Exchange. The spot NIFTY 50 index price is
   INR15,200, the index dividend yield is 2.2%, and the Indian rupee risk-free rate
   is 4%. Use Equation 6 (with c = 0) to solve for the forward price:
      F0(T) = S0e(r+c–i)T

      = 15,200e(0.04 – 0.022)0.25

      = INR15,268.55.

    Foreign exchange requires some adjustments to establish the no-arbitrage condition
between spot and forward prices, as shown in the prior lesson. First, it is important
to distinguish the “price” of the underlying asset, which for equities, fixed income,
or commodities refers to units of currency for each asset—for example, one share of
stock or the principal amount for a bond. In contrast, the foreign exchange rate is
expressed as a spot rate (S0,f/d) specifying the number of units of a price currency (here
denoted as f or foreign currency) in the numerator per single unit of a base currency
(here shown as d or domestic currency) in the denominator. For example, for a USD/
EUR spot rate (S0,f/d) of 1.20, the US dollar is the price currency (f), and the euro is
the base currency (d), with USD1.20 equal to EUR1.
    An FX (foreign exchange) forward contract involves the sale of one currency and
purchase of the other on a future date at a forward price (F0,f/d) agreed on at inception.
A long FX forward position involves the purchase of the base currency and the sale
of the price currency. For example, a long USD/EUR FX forward position is the sale
of US dollars and purchase of euros at a forward rate.
    In the prior replication example, the derivative cash flow stream was recreated by
combining a long or short position in an underlying asset and borrowing or lending
cash. Here the foreign and domestic currency each has an opportunity cost—namely,
the foreign risk-free rate (rf) and the domestic risk-free rate (rd), respectively.

EXAMPLE 6

   AUD/USD Foreign Exchange Forward Replication
   In order to replicate one currency’s return in terms of the other for a given spot
   price today of S0,f/d, we may solve for a forward rate F0,f/d(T) using the earlier
   arbitrage concept that assets with a known future price must have a spot price
   (S0,f/d) equal to the future price discounted at the risk-free rate.
       Assume the current AUD/USD spot price is 1.3335. The Australian dollar is
   the price currency or foreign currency, and the US dollar is the base or domestic
   currency (AUD1.3335 = USD1). The six-month Australian dollar risk-free rate
   is 0.05%, and the six-month US dollar risk-free rate is 0.20%.
       ■   At time t = 0:
           1. Borrow USD1,000 at the 0.20% US dollar risk-free rate for six
              months.
           2. Purchase AUD1,333.50 at the AUD/USD spot rate (S0,f/d = 1.3335).
           3. Lend the AUD1,333.50 received at the 0.05% Australian dollar risk-
              free rate for six months.

                                    5. Exchange Australian dollar proceeds for US dollars at ST,f/d to
                                       repay the US dollar loan.
                                    6. Repay the US dollar loan (with interest) of 1,001 (= 1,000e(0.002 ×
                                        0.5)).
                                If the exchange in Step 5 at time T is at a spot price, ST,f/d, at which the
                            Australian dollar loan proceeds (Step 4) exactly offset the US dollar loan (Step 6),
                            no riskless arbitrage opportunity exists. Solve for ST,f/d by dividing the Australian
                            dollars in Step 4 by the US dollars in Step 6:
                                ST,f/d = 1.3325 (= AUD1,333.83/USD1,001).

                             For the no-arbitrage condition to hold between the FX spot and forward price, the
                         amount of Australian dollars necessary to purchase USD1 at time T (F0,f/d(T)) must
                         have a spot price (S0,f/d) equal to the discounted future price. The relevant discount
                         rate here involves the difference between the foreign and domestic risk-free rates, as
                         shown in the following modified version of Equation 4:
                            F0,f/d(T) = S0,f/de(rf–rd)T.                                                                                    (7)
                         Solve for F0,AUD/USD(T) in Example 6 as follows:
                            F0,f/d(T) = 1.3325 (= 1.3335e(–0.0015 × 0.5)).
                         From Equation 7, we see that it is the risk-free interest rate differential (rf – rd), rather
                         than the absolute level of interest rates, that determines the spot versus forward FX
                         price relationship. For example, in Example 6, the Australian dollar risk-free rate is
                         0.15% below the US dollar rate (rf – rd < 0). Borrowing at the higher US dollar rate
                         and lending at the lower Australian dollar rate results in a no-arbitrage forward price
                         at which fewer Australian dollars are required to purchase USD1 in the future, so the
                         Australian dollar is said to trade at a premium in the forward market versus the US
                         dollar. Exhibit 9 summarizes the relationship between forward and spot FX prices.

We now examine this FX spot versus forward relationship in the case of the Montau
AG example from an earlier lesson.

EXAMPLE 7

   Montau AG’s FX Forward Rate
   An earlier lesson introduced Montau AG, a German capital goods producer.
   Montau signs a commercial contract with Jeon, Inc., a South Korean manu-
   facturer, to deliver a laser cutting machine at a price of KRW650 million in 75
   days. Montau faces a timing mismatch between domestic euro costs incurred
   and euro revenue realized upon the delivery of the machine and sale of South
   Korean won received in exchange for euros in the spot FX market. Montau enters
   a long KRW/EUR FX forward contract. That is, Montau agrees to sell South
   Korean won and purchase euros at a fixed price, F0(T), in 75 days to eliminate
   the KRW/EUR exchange rate mismatch arising from the export contract.
       In this version of the Montau AG example, we use today’s spot exchange rate
   and the domestic (rd) and foreign (rf) risk-free rates to solve for the KRW/EUR
   forward rate. As seen in Equation 7, the difference between spot and forward
   FX rates involves the difference in risk-free rates. In the KRW/EUR case, the
   South Korean won is the price currency or foreign currency and rf is therefore
   the South Korean won interest rate. The euro is the base or domestic currency.
   We may therefore rewrite Equation 7 as follows:
        F0,KRW/EUR(T) = S0,KRW/EURe(rKRW–rEUR)T.
   Assume a spot KRW/EUR rate (S0) of 1,300 (that is, KRW1,300 = EUR1), a South
   Korean won risk-free rate of 0.75%, and a euro risk-free rate of –0.25% (rd).
   Calculate the KRW/EUR forward rate in 75 days consistent with no arbitrage.
        F0,KRW/EUR(T) = 1,300 × e(0.0075 + 0.0025) × (75/365).
   Solving for the KRW/EUR forward rate gives us F0(T) = 1,302.67. Notice that
   the 1% difference between South Korean won and euro interest rates leads to
   a forward price that is above the spot price (F0,f/d(T) > S0,f/d). That is, in six
   months’ time, more South Korean won will be required to purchase a euro, and
   the South Korean won is said to trade at a forward discount versus the euro.
       To demonstrate the no-arbitrage condition between the forward and spot
   rates, assume that Montau converts the KRW650 million into euros at the 1,300
   KRW/EUR spot rate to receive EUR500,000 (= KRW650,000,000/1,300) and
   invests this for 75 days at a continuously compounded rf = –0.25%:
        EUR499,743.22 = EUR500,000 × e[–0.0025 × (75/365)].
       Assume that Jeon Inc. invests the KRW650 million at the South Korean won
   risk-free rate (rd = 0.75%) for 75 days to receive
        KRW651,002,484.59 = KRW650,000,000 × e[0.0075 × (75/365)].
94   Learning Module 4                            Arbitrage, Replication, and the Cost of Carry in Pricing Derivatives


                            An arbitrage-free forward commitment price should therefore allow Montau to
                            convert KRW651,002,484.59 into EUR499,743.22 after 75 days.
                               F0(T) = 651,002,484.59/499,743.22 = 1,302.67.
                            This confirms that the two prices (spot and forward exchange rates) are consis-
                            tent with the risk-free interest rate differential in the two different currencies.

                              In contrast to securities or cash stored electronically, commodities usually involve
                         known costs associated with the storage, insurance, transportation, and potential
                         spoilage (in the case of soft commodities) of these physical assets. A non-cash ben-
                         efit of holding a physical commodity versus a derivative is known as a convenience
                         yield. In physical goods markets, economic conditions may arise that cause market
                         participants to prefer to own the physical commodity. As a simple example, if crude
                         oil inventories are very low, refineries may bid up the spot oil price so that forward
                         prices do not fully reflect storage costs and interest rates. The following example illus-
                         trates the impact of these carry costs on the relationship between spot and forward
                         commitment prices for a commodity, as well as the possibility of a convenience yield.

                         EXAMPLE 8

                            Procam’s Gold Forward Contract with Storage Costs
                            Recall from earlier examples that Procam borrowed and purchased gold in
                            the spot market and simultaneously sold gold in the forward market for three
                            months to earn a riskless profit. Under the assumption of a 2% risk-free rate, we
                            demonstrated that the spot gold price (S0) would need to rise to USD1,783.28 (=
                            USD1,792.13(1.02)–0.25) in order to eliminate the earlier arbitrage opportunity
                            for a given USD1,792.13 forward price where gold may be stored at no cost.
                                Given the spot price of USD1,783.28, how would the forward gold price
                            change to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition if we were to introduce a USD2
                            per ounce cost of gold storage and insurance payable at the end of the contract?
                                The forward commitment price for a commodity with known storage cost
                            amounts may be determined using Equation 5, where PV0(I) = 0:
                               F0(T) = [S0 + PV0(C)](1 + r)T.
                            First, solve for the present value of the storage cost per ounce PV0(C) as follows:
                               PV0(C) = USD2(1.02)–0.25

                               = USD1.99.
                            Substitute PV0(C) = USD1.99 into Equation 5 to solve for F0(T):
                               F0(T) = (USD1,783.28 + USD1.99)(1.02)0.25

                               = USD1,794.13.
                            Note that the addition of storage and insurance costs increases the difference
                            between the spot and forward price. Finally, note that a forward price, F0(T),
                            significantly below the no-arbitrage price may indicate the presence of a con-
                            venience yield.

                             The additional costs and benefits of underlying asset ownership are summarized

QUESTION SET

   Cost of Carry

   1. Describe the relationship between the spot and forward price for an un-
      derlying asset whose benefits exceed the opportunity and other costs of
      ownership.
      Solution:
      If the benefits for an owner of an underlying asset exceed the opportunity
      and other costs of owning the underlying asset, the spot price will be greater
      than the forward price.

   2. Identify which example corresponds to each of the following relationships
      between the spot and forward rate:
                                                ​




    1. F0(T) > S0                               A. A fixed-coupon bond priced at par
                                                whose coupon is above the risk-free rate
    2. F0(T) < S0                               B. A foreign currency forward where the
                                                domestic risk-free rate is greater than the
                                                foreign risk-free rate
    3. Not enough information to deter-         C. A commodity with a convenience yield
    mine the relationship between F0(T)         as well as storage and insurance costs
    and S0
                                                ​




      Solution:
      1. B is correct. The FX forward rate is greater than the spot rate if the do-
      mestic risk-free rate is greater than the foreign risk-free rate.

                           2. A is correct. A fixed-coupon bond priced at par has an income that ex-
                           ceeds the opportunity cost of the risk-free rate, so F0(T) < S0.
                           3. C is correct. We do not have enough information to fully evaluate the
                           benefit (convenience yield) versus the cost (risk-free rate, storage, and insur-
                           ance) of holding the physical commodity asset in this example.

                         3. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: A positive risk-free rate
                            causes a forward price to be _______ than the underlying spot price, all else
                            equal, and the higher the risk-free rate, the _______ the difference between
                            the two.
                           Solution:
                           A positive risk-free rate causes a forward price to be greater than the under-
                           lying spot price, all else equal, and the higher the risk-free rate, the greater
                           the difference between the two.

                         4. An analyst observes that the current spot MXN/USD exchange rate is 19.50,
                            the Mexican peso six-month risk free rate is 4%, and the six-month US dol-
                            lar risk free rate is 0.25%. Describe the relationship between the MXN/USD
                            spot and six-month forward rate, and justify your answer.
                           Solution:
                           The relationship between the MXN/USD FX spot and forward price de-
                           pends on the risk-free interest rate differential between the Mexican peso
                           and the US dollar (rf – rd > 0, since 3.75% = 4.0% – 0.25%). Since the Mex-
                           ican peso rate is 3.75% above the US dollar rate, we would expect that bor-
                           rowing at a higher Mexican peso rate and lending at a lower US dollar rate
                           would result in a no-arbitrage forward price at which more Mexican pesos
                           are required to purchase USD1 in the future, so the Mexican peso is said to
                           trade at a discount in the forward market versus the US dollar (F0,MXN/US-
                           D(T) > S0,MXN/USD).
                           We can show this using Equation 7 for the case of MXN/USD as follows:
                            F0,MXN/USD(T) = S0,MXN/USDe(rMXN–rUSD)T.
                           Based on the current S0,f/d of 19.50, rf = 4%, rd = 0.25%, and T of 0.5, we may
                           solve for the no-arbitrage forward price, F0,f/d, as
                            F0,MXN/USD(T) = 19.50e[(0.04 – 0.0025) × 0.5]

                            = 19.8691.


                         5. Assume that new, stricter environmental regulations associated with oil
                            storage and insurance cause the cost of these services to increase sharply.
                            Describe the anticipated effect of these increased costs on the relationship
                            between oil spot and forward commitment prices.
                           Solution:
                           Owners of physical commodities who must incur storage and insurance
                           costs over time expect to be compensated by higher forward commitment
                           prices for future delivery of the underlying assets. Assuming other factors
                           are constant, higher storage and insurance costs therefore lead to higher for-
                           ward commitment prices and a greater difference between spot and forward
                           prices. As shown in Equation 5, an increase in C increases F0(T) for a given
                           S0:

INTRODUCTION
Earlier lessons introduced forward commitment features, payoff profiles, and concepts
                                                                                              1
used in pricing these derivative instruments. In particular, the relationship between
spot and forward commitment prices was established as the opportunity cost of own-
ing the underlying asset (represented by the risk-free rate) as well as any additional
cost or benefit associated with holding the underlying asset. This price relationship
both prevents arbitrage and allows a forward commitment to be replicated using spot
market transactions and risk-free borrowing or lending.
    In the first lesson, we explore the pricing and valuation of forward commitments
on a mark-to-market basis from inception through maturity. This analysis is essential
for issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries alike to assess the value of any asset
or liability portfolio that includes these instruments. The second lesson addresses for-
ward pricing for the special case of underlying assets with different maturities such as
interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility. The prices of these forward commitments
across the so-called term structure are an important building block for pricing swaps
and related instruments in later lessons.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   A forward commitment price agreed upon at contract incep-
           tion remains fixed and establishes the basis on which the
           underlying asset (or cash) will be exchanged in the future versus the
           spot price at maturity.

                                                                                                       Maturities

                              ■   For an underlying asset that does not generate cash flows, the value of
                                  a long forward commitment prior to expiration equals the current spot
                                  price of the underlying asset minus the present value of the forward
                                  price discounted at the risk-free rate. The reverse is true for a short
                                  forward commitment. Foreign exchange represents a special case in
                                  which the spot versus forward price is a function of the difference
                                  between risk-free rates across currencies.
                              ■   For an underlying asset with additional costs and benefits, the forward
                                  contract mark-to-market (MTM) value is adjusted by the sum of the
                                  present values of all additional cash flows through maturity.
                              ■   Underlying assets with a term structure, such as interest rates, have
                                  different rates or prices for different times-to-maturity. These zero or
                                  spot and forward rates are derived from coupon bonds and market
                                  reference rates and establish the building blocks of interest rate deriv-
                                  atives pricing.
                              ■   Implied forward rates represent a breakeven reinvestment rate linking
                                  short-dated and long-dated zero-coupon bonds over a specific period.
                              ■   A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract in which counterparties
                                  agree to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. Match the following situations with their corresponding forward contract
                              valuation for an asset with no additional costs or benefits.
                                                                      ​




                             1. At time t = 0, the spot price of     A. The forward contract buyer has an
                             the underlying asset rises instanta-    MTM gain.
                             neously and other market parame-
                             ters remain unchanged.

                             2. At time t, the present value of      B. The forward contract seller has an
                             the forward price discounted at the     MTM gain.
                             risk-free rate (r) equals the current
                             spot price (St).

                             3. At time T, the forward contract      C. The MTM value of the forward con-
                             price, F0(T), is greater than the       tract is zero.
                             current spot price, ST.
                                                                      ​




                             Solution:
                             1. A is correct. In order to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition, the original
                             spot price, S0 at t = 0, must equal the present value of the forward price
                             discounted at the risk-free rate, r. An immediate increase in the spot price to
                             S0+ > S0 results in an MTM gain for the forward buyer.
                             2. C is correct. At any time t, the MTM value, Vt(T), is equal to the differ-
                             ence between the current spot price, St, and the present value of the forward
                             price discounted at the risk-free rate, r, or F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t). When St = F0(T)
                             (1 + r)-(T-t), then Vt(T) = 0.
                             3. B is correct. The MTM value to the forward contract seller upon settle-
                             ment at time T is equal to the settlement value of F0(T) − ST.
Introduction                                                                             101


  2. An increase in the risk-free rate, r, following the inception of a forward con-
     tract will cause which of the following to the forward contract’s MTM value
     to the forward seller if other parameters remain unchanged.
      A. The forward contract’s MTM value to the forward seller will be
         unchanged.
      B. The forward contract’s MTM value to the forward seller will increase.
      C. The forward contract’s MTM value to the forward seller will decrease.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The mark-to-market value from the forward seller’s perspective
     is equal to Vt(T) in the following equation:
     Vt(T) = F0(T)(1 + r)–(T–t) − St.
     An increase in the risk-free rate, r, following the inception of a forward con-
     tract will cause the present value of the forward price, F0(T), to fall, and this
     will reduce the MTM value from the contract seller’s perspective.

  3. Which of the following is closest to the two-year zero rate given a 3% annual
     coupon bond priced at 99 per 100 face value if a one-year annual coupon
     bond from the same issuer has a yield-to-maturity of 2.50%?
      A. 3.5266%
      B. 3.5000%
      C. 3.5422%
     Solution:
     C is correct. The yield-to-maturity and the zero rate for a bond with a
     single cash flow at maturity in one period are identical, so the one-year zero
     rate, z1, equals 2.50%. Solve for the two-year zero rate (z2) in the following
     equation:
     99 = 3/1.025 + 103/(1 + z2)2.
     Solve for z2 to get 3.5422%. A is incorrect because 3.5266% is the internal
     rate of return (IRR) solved for cash flows of –99 at t = 0, 3 at t = 1, and 103
     at t = 2. This response assumes a flat term structure, which is not a correct
     assumption given the question. B is incorrect because this response implies
     that we can find the correct answer by assuming the coupon rate is the sim-
     ple average of the one- and two-year zero rates.

  4. Which of the following is a correct description of a 2y3y forward rate?
      A. The implied two-year rate beginning three years in the future.
      B. The implied three-year rate beginning two years in the future.
      C. The implied one-year rate beginning two years in the future.
     Solution:
     B is correct. In the terminology of forward rates, the first number reflects
     the point in time when a forward rate begins; thus, the forward rate stated
     above reflects a rate starting two years in the future. The second number
     reflects the maturity of the rate. Thus, the 2y3y forward rate reflects a three-
     year rate starting in two years. A is incorrect because this is the description
     of the 3y2y forward rate. C is incorrect because this is the description of the
     2y1y rate.

              2           PRICING AND VALUATION OF FORWARD CONTRACTS

                                        explain how the value and price of a forward contract are determined
                                        at initiation, during the life of the contract, and at expiration



                          Pricing versus Valuation of Forward Contracts
                          When counterparties enter into forward, futures, or swap contracts with one another,
                          these contracts have an initial value of zero (ignoring trading and transaction costs as
                          well as counterparty credit exposure). While forward commitments require no cash
                          outlay at inception, their price incorporates the opportunity cost of a long cash posi-
                          tion as measured by the risk-free rate. The forward price or forward rate established
                          at inception remains fixed and determines the basis on which the underlying asset (or
                          cash) will be exchanged in the future versus the spot price at maturity.
                              As time passes and/or the underlying asset spot price and other parameters change,
                          the value of a forward contract changes. This mark-to-market value of a contract reflects
                          the change in the underlying price and other factors that would result in a gain or loss
                          to a counterparty if the forward contract were to be settled immediately. The MTM
                          gain of the forward seller will equal the MTM loss of the forward buyer and vice versa.
                          Recall that a key difference between exchange-traded futures and over-the-counter
                          forwards is that the futures clearinghouse settles these MTM changes in cash on a
                          daily basis, while forward contract settlement typically occurs at maturity.

                          Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts at Initiation
                          The prior learning module established that a forward contract agreed at time t = 0
                          occurs at a forward price, F0(T), that satisfies no-arbitrage conditions for the underly-
                          ing spot price (S0), the risk-free rate of return (r), and any additional costs or benefits
                          associated with underlying asset ownership until the forward contract matures at time
                          T. In an earlier example, AMY Investments agreed to purchase 1,000 Airbus (AIR)
                          shares trading at the spot price (ST) at maturity at an agreed upon forward price,
                          F0(T), of EUR30 per share, as shown in Exhibit 1.

                                           V0(T) = 0




If we assume S0 = EUR29.70, r = 1.00% and T is one year, F0(T) of EUR30 satisfies the
no-arbitrage condition at t = 0 (ignoring transaction costs). The forward contract is
neither an asset nor a liability to AMY Investments (the buyer) or the financial inter-
mediary (the seller) and therefore has a value of zero to both parties:
   V0(T) = 0                                                                     (1)


Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts at Maturity
Recall from an earlier lesson that a forward commitment has a symmetric payoff pro-
file. That is, at time T a forward contract is settled based on the difference between
the forward price, F0(T), and the underlying spot price, ST, or ST − F0(T), from the
buyer’s perspective, as shown in Exhibit 2.

                              AMY must pay the agreed upon price of F0(T) in exchange for the underlying
                          asset at the current spot price of ST. Since the contract settles at maturity, its value
                          at maturity is equal to the settlement amount from each counterparty’s perspective.
                          For example, at time t = T, the value of the forward contract at maturity, V T(T), from
                          the perspective of AMY (the forward buyer) equals:
                             VT(T) = ST − F0(T)                                                                   (2)

                             The Viswan Family Office (VFO) currently owns 10,000 common non-divi-
                             dend-paying shares of Biomian Limited, a Mumbai-based biotech company, at
                             a spot price of INR 295 per share. VFO agrees to sell forward 1,000 shares of
                             Biomian stock to a financial intermediary for INR300.84 per share in six months.
                             Calculate the contract value at maturity, V T(T), from both the buyer’s and the
                             seller’s perspective if the spot price at maturity (ST) is:
                                 (1) ST = INR 287

                                 (2) ST = INR 312

   Solution:
   At contract inception, VFO enters into a forward contract with a financial inter-
   mediary to sell Biomian for F0(T) = INR 300.84. The forward contract value at
   initiation for both VFO and the financial intermediary, V0(T), is zero.
       (1) ST = INR287 and F0(T) = INR300.84. The contract value per share at
   maturity equals its settlement value from the perspective of both the financial
   intermediary (buyer) and VFO (seller), as follows:
       • Buyer (long forward position): V T(T) = ST − F0(T)
       V T(T) = −INR13.84 = 287 − 300.84
       • Viswan Family Office (short forward position): V T(T) = F0(T) − ST
       V T(T) = INR13.84 = 300.84 − 287
       (2) ST = INR312 and F0(T) = INR300.84. The contract value per share at
   maturity equals its settlement value from the perspective of both the financial
   intermediary (buyer) and VFO (seller), as follows:
       • Buyer (long forward position): V T(T) = ST − F0(T)
       V T(T) = INR11.16 = 312 − 300.84
       • Viswan Family Office (short forward position): V T(T) = F0(T) − ST
       V T(T) = −INR11.16 = 300.84 − 312


Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts during the Life of the Contract
Once a forward contract is initiated between two counterparties, the passage of time
and changes in the underlying asset’s spot price, among other factors, will cause the
forward contract value to change. The mark-to-market value of a contract at any point
in time from inception to maturity, Vt(T), reflects the relationship between the current
spot price at time t (St) and the present value of the forward price at time t discounted
at the current risk-free rate. Exhibit 3 shows this relationship for the Airbus equity
forward example from AMY Investments’ perspective (the long forward position).

                          Recall that under no-arbitrage conditions, the forward price of an underlying asset
                          with no additional cost or benefit of ownership equals the future value of the spot
                          price at the risk-free rate, r:
                             F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T                                                                        (3)
                          At any time t over the life of the contract where t < T, we can show the present value
                          of the forward price, F0(T), at time t as follows:
                             PVt of F0(T) = F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)                                                         (4)
                          If St is the spot price of the underlying asset at time t, Equation 5 shows the forward
                          contract MTM value at time t, Vt(T), from the long forward position’s perspective:
                             Vt(T) = St − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)                                                           (5)
                          Exhibit 4 shows the relationship between the spot price, the forward price, and the

                            As in Example 1, VFO enters into a six-month forward contract with a financial
                            intermediary to sell Biomian shares for F0(T) = INR300.84 per share. The current
                            spot price is INR295 per share.

                                        Biomian’s share price rises instantaneously to INR325 at contract

                                        to solve for the risk-free rate, r:
                                     F0(T) = S0(1 + r)T

                                     300.84 = 295(1 + r)0.5

                                     r = 0.04 or 4%

            2. As the forward contract seller, we must rearrange Equation 5 to solve
               for the contract MTM value from VFO’s perspective as follows:
            Vt(T) = F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t) − St
   Note that if t = 0, F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t) simplifies to F0(T)(1 + r)-T = S0, so the contract
   value from VFO’s perspective can be shown simply as:
            Vt(T) = S0 − St

            −INR30 = INR295 − INR325
   If we consider the new higher Biomian price as S0+ = INR325, we can show this
   MTM change in the following diagram:

   The combination of spot price changes over the life of a forward contract and the
passage of time causes the MTM value of a forward contract to fluctuate over time,
representing a gain or loss to contract participants so long as St ≠ F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t).
Exhibit 5 shows this relationship, assuming a constant risk-free rate over the life of a
contract for long and short forward contract positions.

                          EXAMPLE 3

                             Biomian Forward Contract MTM over Time and Changes in
                             Risk-Free Rate
                             As in earlier examples, VFO enters into a six-month forward contract with a
                             financial intermediary to sell Biomian shares at F0(T) = INR300.84 per share.
                             The spot price at t = 0 is INR295 per share and the risk-free rate is 4%.

                                1. Calculate the forward contract MTM from VFO’s perspective in three
                                   months (t = 0.25) if Biomian’s spot price (St) falls to INR285 per share.
                                2. Show the forward contract MTM from VFO’s perspective in Question
                                   (1) if the risk-free rate doubles from 4% to 8%, and interpret the
                                   results.
                             Solution:
                             (1) From VFO’s perspective as the forward contract seller, rearrange Equation
                             5 to solve for the contract MTM value as follows:
                                 Vt(T) = F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t) − St
                                 Solve for Vt(T) where F0(T) = 300.84, r = 0.04, T = 0.5, t = 0.25, and St = 285:
                                 Vt(T) = 300.84(1.04)-(0.25) − 285
                                 Vt(T) = INR12.90 MTM gain
                                 (2) Solve for Vt(T) using the same equation and inputs as in Question (1)
                             except that r = 0.08:
                                 Vt(T) = F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t) − St
                                 Solve for Vt(T) where F0(T) = 300.84, r = 0.08, T = 0.5, t = 0.25, and St = 285:
                                 Vt(T) = 300.84(1.08)-(0.25) − 285
                                 Vt(T) = INR10.11 MTM gain
                                 VFO’s MTM gain on the contract has declined by INR2.79 (12.90 − 10.11).
                             The higher risk-free rate increases the opportunity cost of a cash position and
                             lowers the present value of the forward price, reducing VFO’s MTM gain, Vt(T),
                             as represented by the present value of F0(T) − St.


                          Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts with Additional Costs or Benefits
                          The pricing and valuation of forward contracts in this lesson have assumed that there
                          are no cash flows associated with the underlying asset. We showed that the contract
                          MTM value at any time t equals the difference between the current spot price and the
                          present value of the forward price discounted at the risk-free rate. Now we turn our
                          attention to how the cost of carry, or the net of all costs and benefits related to owning
                          an underlying asset or index, affects the valuation of a forward contract. Recall the
                          relationship between spot and forward prices for underlying assets with ownership
                          benefits or income (I) or costs (C), which is expressed as a present value at time t =
                          0 in discrete compounding terms:
                             F0(T) = (S0 − PV0(I) + PV0(C)) (1 + r)T                                          (6)
                          Equation 6 incorporates the cost of carry and satisfies the no-arbitrage condition at t
                          = 0 (ignoring transaction costs). A forward contract at a price, F0(T), that incorporates
                          these known costs and benefits is neither an asset nor a liability to the buyer or seller
                          at inception: V0(T) = 0. Also, since the forward price, F0(T), incorporates the cost of
                          carry, the value at maturity, V T(T), is equal to the difference between the spot price
                          (ST) at maturity and the original forward price, F0(T).

    At any time t over the life of the contract, the MTM value of the forward contract,
Vt(T), will depend on the difference between the current spot price adjusted for any
remaining costs or benefits from time t through maturity, St − PVt(I) + PVt(C), and the
present value of the forward price, PVtF0(T) = F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t). This result is shown
in Equation 7 from the long forward counterparty’s perspective:
   Vt(T) = (St − PVt(I) + PVt(C)) − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)                                            (7)


EXAMPLE 4

   Hightest Equity Forward Valuation
   In an earlier example, Hightest Capital agreed to deliver 1,000 Unilever (UL)
   shares to a financial intermediary in six months under a forward contract at a
   price of EUR 50,631.10, or EUR 50.6311 per share. Unilever pays a quarterly
   dividend of EUR 0.30 three months after contract inception and at time T, and
   the risk-free rate (r) is 5%. Calculate the forward contract breakeven price, St,
   where Vt(T) = MTM = 0 four months after contract inception if the risk-free
   rate, r, remains unchanged at 5%.
       Use Equation 7 with PVt(C) = 0 to solve for Vt(T) = 0 four months after
   contract inception:
       Vt(T) = (St − PVt(I)) − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)
       First, solve for the present value of the dividend per share, PVt(I), given that
   the second dividend will be paid in two months:
       PVt(I) = EUR0.30(1.05)-0.167
       = EUR0.2976
      Time
             0                                       t = 4m                        T = 6m

                                                      PV for 2 months: Discount by (1.05)–2/12




                                                      PVt(I) = €0.2976            I = €0.30




                                                    PVt(F0(T)) = €50.2202      F0(T) = €50.6311



                                                  “Breakeven” St= €50.5178

       Substitute PVt(I) = EUR0.2976 into Equation 5 to solve for Vt(T) = 0:
       0 = (St − 0.2976) − 50.6311(1.05)-0.167
       St = EUR50.2202 + EUR0.2976
       = EUR50.5178
       Hightest Capital’s breakeven spot rate, St (i.e., where Vt(T) = 0), four months
   after inception of the forward contract is therefore EUR50.5178 per share.

    Forward commitments on underlying indexes such as equity indexes or commodity
indexes are predominantly exchange-traded index futures contracts. An earlier lesson
used the rate of return over the life of the contract under continuous compounding to
establish the relationship between spot and forward pricing for these instruments. The
valuation of index futures and other futures contracts will be addressed in a later lesson.

                                                                                                          Maturities

                              Recall that for a foreign exchange forward, both spot (S0,f/d) and forward (F0,f/d(T))
                          prices are expressed in terms of units of a price currency (f or foreign currency) per
                          single unit of a base currency (d or domestic currency). The spot price versus forward
                          price relationship reflects the difference between the foreign risk-free rate, rf, and the
                          domestic risk-free rate, rd, as shown in Equation 8:
                             F0,f/d(T) = S0,f/d e(rf–rd)T                                                     (8)
                          At trade inception at t = 0, the currency with the lower risk-free rate for the forward
                          period is said to trade at a forward premium—that is, fewer units of currency are
                          required to purchase one unit of the other—while the currency with the higher risk-free
                          rate trades at a forward discount.
                              At any given time t, the MTM value of the FX forward is the difference between
                          the current spot FX price (St,f/d) and the present value of the forward price discounted
                          by the current difference in risk-free rates (rf − rd) for the remaining period through
                          maturity, as shown in Equation 9:
                             Vt(T) = St,f/d − F0,f/d(T)e-(rf–rd)(T–t)                                         (9)
                          Changes in the interest rate differential (rf − rd) represent a change in the relative
                          opportunity cost between currencies. As described in an earlier lesson, a price change
                          of one currency in terms of another is referred to as appreciation or depreciation. For
                          example, if fewer USD are required to purchase one EUR, then the USD/EUR exchange
                          rate falls and the USD is said to appreciate against the EUR.
                              A greater interest rate differential—that is, an increase in (rf − rd)—causes the
                          price, or foreign, currency to depreciate on a forward basis and the base, or domestic,
                          currency to appreciate. The following example illustrates the effect of an interest rate
                          change on the FX forward contract MTM value.

                          EXAMPLE 5

                             Rook Point Investors LLC has entered into a long one-year USD/EUR forward
                             contract. That is, it has agreed to purchase EUR1,000,000 in exchange for
                             USD1,201,000 in one year. At time t = 0 when the contract is initiated, the USD/
                             EUR spot exchange rate is 1.192 (i.e., USD1.192 = EUR1), the one-year USD
                             risk-free rate is 0.50%, and the one-year EUR risk-free rate is −0.25%.
                                  Describe the MTM impact on the FX forward contract from Rook Point’s
                             perspective if the one-year USD risk-free rate instantaneously rises by 0.25%
                             once the contract is initiated, with other details unchanged.
                                  The instantaneous rise in the USD risk-free rate by 0.25% (from 0.5% to
                             0.75%) increases the difference between the foreign and domestic risk-free rates
                             (rf − rd), increasing the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the
                             forward rate, F0,f/d(T). Since S0,f/d > F0,f/d(T)e-(rf–rd)(T–t), V0(T) > 0 from Rook
                             Point’s perspective and it realizes an MTM gain.
                                  We can solve for the MTM value at time t = 0 by first rewriting Equation 9:
                                  Vt(T) = S0,USD/EUR − F0,USD/EUR (T)e-(rUSD–rEUR)T
                                  Solve for Vt(T) from Rook Point’s perspective, with S0,f/d = 1.192 USD/EUR,
                             F0,f/d = 1.201 USD/EUR, rf = 0.75%, rd = −0.25%, and T = 1.
                                  = 1.192 − 1.201e-(0.0075 + 0.0025)
                                  = 0.00295 USD/EUR
                                  Note that this positive exchange rate difference of 0.00295 USD/EUR can
                             be shown in Equation 9 if we instead substitute the USD needed to purchase
                             EUR1,000,000 to arrive at a USD contract value:

      = USD1,192,000 − USD1,201,000e-(0.0075 + 0.0025)
      = USD2,950.15 MTM gain

risk-free rates both over time and across maturities. In the next lesson, we will
explore how spot and forward prices change for variables, with different prices across
maturities.

QUESTION SET

   Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts

   1. Identify which MTM situation corresponds to which forward price versus
      spot price relationship for an underlying asset with no additional costs or
      benefits.
                                               ​




     1. At time t = 0 once the forward        A. The forward contract seller has an
     price is agreed, the spot price of the   MTM loss.
     underlying asset immediately falls
     and other market parameters remain
     unchanged.
     2. At time T, the forward contract       B. The forward contract seller has an
     price, F0(T), equals the current spot    MTM gain.
     price, ST.
     3. At time T, the forward contract       C. The MTM value of the forward con-
     price, F0(T), is below the current       tract is zero.
     spot price, ST.
                                               ​




      Solution:
      1. B is correct. To satisfy the no-arbitrage condition, the original spot price,
      S0 at t = 0, must equal the present value of the forward price discounted at
      the risk-free rate, r. Therefore, an immediate fall in the spot price to S0- < S0
      results in an MTM gain for the forward contract seller.
      2. C is correct. At time T, the MTM value, Vt(T), is equal to contract settle-
      ment, or the difference between F0(T) and ST, which in this case is zero.
      3. A is correct. The MTM value to the forward seller upon settlement at
      time T equals F0(T) − ST, so the seller has a loss if F0(T) < ST.

   2. Identify the following statement as true or false and justify your answer:

      At time t, a forward contract with no additional cash flows has a value equal
      to the difference between the current spot price and the present value of the
      forward price. Therefore, the MTM value of the forward contract from the
      seller’s perspective is St − PV of F0(T).
      Solution:
      This statement is false. Although the forward contract MTM equals the dif-
      ference between the current spot price and the present value of the forward
      price, the MTM value of the forward contract from the seller’s perspective is
      PV of F0(T) − St.

   3. Assume that Hightest Capital enters into a six-month forward contract to
      purchase Unilever (UL) shares at EUR51.23. UL shares pay no dividend, and
      the risk-free rate across all maturities is 5%. Calculate the forward contract
112   Learning Module 5             Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts and for an Underlying with Varying
                                                                                                       Maturities

                            MTM value from Hightest’s perspective in three months’ time if the current
                            UL spot rate, St, is EUR50.50 and the risk-free rate does not change.
                            Solution:
                            Use Equation 5 to solve for the forward contract value in three months from
                            Hightest’s perspective:
                            Vt(T) = St − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)
                            If St = EUR50.50, F0(T) = EUR51.23, r = 5%, and T − t = 0.25:
                            Vt(T) = EUR50.50 − (EUR51.23)(1.05)-0.25
                            = −EUR0.1089
                            Hightest therefore has an MTM loss of EUR0.11 on the forward contract in
                            three months’ time.

                          4. Match the following statements with their corresponding MTM situation
                             for an underlying asset with additional costs and benefits.
                                                                       ​




                            1. At time t, the present value of the    A. The forward contract has an MTM
                            benefits of owning the underlying         value equal to the difference between the
                            asset is greater than the present         current spot price and the present value
                            value of the costs.                       of the forward price.
                            2. At time t, the present value of the    B. The forward contract has an MTM
                            benefits of owning the underlying         value greater than the difference between
                            asset is equal to the present value of    the current spot price and the present
                            the costs.                                value of the forward price.
                            3. At time t, the present value of the    C. The forward contract has an MTM
                            benefits of owning the underlying         value less than the difference between the
                            asset is less than the present value of   current spot price and the present value
                            the costs.                                of the forward price.
                                                                       ​




                            Solution:
                            Recall the forward contract MTM value, Vt(T), for underlying assets with
                            additional costs and benefits from the long forward counterparty’s perspec-
                            tive in Equation 7:
                            Vt(T) = (St − PVt(I) + PVt(C)) − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)
                            1. C is correct. A higher present value of the benefits of owning the under-
                            lying asset versus the present value of the costs will reduce the MTM below
                            the difference between the current spot price and the present value of the
                            forward price. For Equation 7, if PVt(C) − PVt(I) < 0, then:
                            Vt(T) < St − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)
                            2. A is correct. If the present values of the remaining benefits and costs of
                            owning the underlying asset offset each other, then the forward contract
                            MTM equals the difference between the current spot price and the present
                            value of the forward price. For Equation 7, if PVt(C) − PVt(I) = 0, then:
                            Vt(T) = St − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)
                            3. B is correct. A lower present value of the benefits of owning the underly-
                            ing asset versus the present value of the costs will increase the MTM beyond
                            the difference between the current spot price and the present value of the
                            forward price. For Equation 7, if PVt(C) − PVt(I) > 0, then:
                            Vt(T) > St − F0(T)(1 + r)-(T-t)

                          5. Rook Point Investors LLC has entered into a six-month FX forward con-
                             tract in which it agrees to sell South African rand (ZAR) and buy EUR at a
                             forward ZAR/EUR price of 17.2506 in six months. The ZAR/EUR spot price
                             is 16.909, the six-month South African risk-free rate is 3.5%, and the six-
                             month EUR risk-free rate is −0.5%. Describe the FX forward MTM impact
Pricing and Valuation of Interest Rate Forward Contracts                                         113


      from Rook Point’s perspective of an immediate appreciation in ZAR/EUR to
      16.5 if other parameters are unchanged.
      Solution:
      An immediate appreciation in the ZAR/EUR spot price after contract
      inception will result in an MTM gain from Rook Point’s perspective as the
      forward seller of ZAR/EUR.
      The FX forward MTM from Rook Point’s perspective equals the present val-
      ue of the forward price discounted at the interest rate differential between
      the foreign currency and the domestic currency minus the spot price:
      V0(T) = F0,f/d (T) e-(rf–rd)T − S0,f/d
      Note that ZAR is the price, or foreign, currency and EUR is the base, or
      domestic, currency, so we can rewrite the equation as:
      V0(T) = F0,ZAR/EUR (T) e-(rZAR–rEUR)T − S0,ZAR/EUR
      If the ZAR price (S0,ZAR/EUR) appreciates from 16.909 to 16.5, we can show
      that Rook Point would have a 0.4090 gain, as follows:
      Vt(T) = 17.2506e-(0.035 – -0.005)×(0.5) − 16.5
      = 16.909 − 16.5
      = 0.4090




PRICING AND VALUATION OF INTEREST RATE
FORWARD CONTRACTS                                                                            3
              explain how forward rates are determined for interest rate forward
              contracts and describe the uses of these forward rates.



Interest Rate Forward Contracts
The relationship between spot and forward prices of underlying assets uses a constant
risk-free interest rate as the opportunity cost of owning the underlying asset. Unlike
equities and commodities, addressed earlier, interest rates are characterized by a term
structure—that is, different interest rates exist for different times-to-maturity. While
this lesson focuses on interest rates, similar principles apply to other underlying vari-
ables with a term structure, including credit spreads and implied volatility as well as
foreign exchange, where two interest rate term structures are involved.

Spot Rates and Discount Factors
The relationships between spot and forward interest rates, established in earlier
fixed-income lessons, are key building blocks for interest rate derivatives pricing. These
building blocks are usually based on a government benchmark or market reference
rate. While most fixed-income instruments have coupon cash flows prior to maturity,
interest rate derivatives pricing and valuation are based on the price and yield of single
cash flows on a future date. The transformation of these cash flows from one form
into another is a first step in the process, as in the following example.

                           Note that each bond trades at a discount (PV < FV). As a first step, we solve for each bond’s
                           yield-to-maturity (YTM) using the Excel RATE function (=RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv],[type])). For
                           example, for the three-year bond, we use nper = 3, pmt = 3.25, pv = −98, fv = 100, and type = 0
                           (indicating payment at the end of the period) to solve for the three-year bond YTM of 3.9703%.

                               We can use these government yields-to-maturity to solve for a sequence of
                           yields-to-maturity on zero-coupon bonds, or zero rates (z1, … zN), where zi is
                           the zero rate for period i.
                               Starting with the one-year bond, which consists of a single cash flow at
                           maturity, we can solve for the one-year zero rate (z1) as follows:
                               One-year:
                                               101.5

                               The yield-to-maturity rate and the zero rate for a bond with a single cash
                           flow at maturity in one period are identical. Since all cash flows at time t = 1
                           are discounted at z1, we can substitute z1 into the two-year fixed-coupon bond
                           calculation to solve for the zero-coupon rate at the end of the second period (z2):
                               Two-year:

    This process of deriving zero or spot rates from coupon bonds using forward
substitution, as shown in Example 6, is sometimes referred to as bootstrapping. The
price equivalent of a zero rate is the present value of a currency unit on a future date,
known as a discount factor. The discount factor for period i (DFi) is:

               ​ 1 i ​	
   	​D ​Fi​​ = _                                                                    (10)
             ​(1 + ​z​i​)​​

For each of the zero rates shown in Example 6, an equivalent discount factor can be
derived as follows:

     One-year: DF1 = 1/(1 + z1); DF1 = 0.976601

     Two-year: DF2 = 1/(1 + z2)2; DF2 = 0.934961

   Three-year: DF3 = 1/(1 + z3)3; DF3 = 0.888982
    A discount factor may also be interpreted as the price of a zero-coupon cash flow
or bond. We can use the discount factor for any period to demonstrate the same
no-arbitrage condition from an earlier lesson—namely, that an asset with a known
future price must trade at the present value of its future price as determined by using
an appropriate discount rate.
    For example, assume a two-year GBP risk-free zero rate (z2) of 3.42% and a two-year
zero-coupon bond with a face value of GBP100 trading at a price of GBP92.45. The
no-arbitrage price of the zero-coupon bond is equal to GBP93.4955: GBP100/(1.0342)2.
In order to earn a riskless arbitrage profit, we can take the following steps, as shown
in Exhibit 6.

                          Forward Rates
                          As in the case of other underlying assets, the forward market for interest rates involves
                          a delivery date beyond the usual cash market settlement date. Given the term structures
                          of different interest rates for different maturities, an interest rate forward contract
                          specifies both the length of the forward period and the tenor of the underlying rate.
                              For example, a two-year forward contract that references a three-year underlying
                          interest rate (which starts at the end of year two and matures at the end of year five)
                          is referred to as a “2y3y” forward rate, which we will denote as F2,3. Short-term mar-
                          ket reference rates (MRRs) usually reference a forward rate in months—for instance,
                          F3m,6m references a six-month MRR that begins in three months and matures nine
                          months from today.
                              The breakeven reinvestment rate linking a short-dated and a long-dated zero-coupon
                          bond is an implied forward rate (IFR). That is, the implied forward rate is the interest
                          rate for a period in the future at which an investor earns the same return from:
                             1. investing for a period from today until the forward start date and rolling
                                over the proceeds at the implied forward rate, or
                             2. investing today through the final maturity of the forward rate.
                              The fact that these strategies have equal returns establishes the no-arbitrage con-
                          dition for the implied forward rate. The following example demonstrates how spot
                          rates can be used to derive forward rates.

      Using the one-year and two-year zero rates from the prior example, an
   investor faces the following investment choices over a two-year period:

        1. Invest USD100 for one year today at the zero rate (z1) of 2.396% and
           reinvest the proceeds of USD102.40 at the one-year rate in one year’s
           time, or the “1y1y” implied forward rate (IFR1,1).
        2. Invest USD100 for two years at the two-year zero rate (z2) of 3.4197%
           to receive USD100(1 + z2)2, or USD106.96.

                                      $102.40                                                 102.396 (1 + IFR1,1)

       In order to arrive at the same return for investment choices 1.) and 2.), we
   set them equal to each other and solve for IFR1,1 as follows:
       USD100 × (1 + z1) × (1 + IFR1,1) = USD100 × (1 + z2)2
       USD100 × (1.02396) × (1 + IFR1,1) = USD100 × (1.034197)2
       IFR1,1 = 4.4536%
       We can demonstrate that the IFR1,1 of 4.4536% creates identical returns for
   the first and second strategies by calculating the return on the first strategy as
   follows:
       USD100 × (1.02396) × (1.044536) = USD106.96

     In general, assume a shorter-term bond matures in A periods and a longer-term
bond matures in B periods. The yields-to-maturity per period on these bonds are
denoted as zA and zB. The first bond is an A-period zero-coupon bond trading in the
cash market. The second is a B-period zero-coupon cash market bond. The implied
forward rate between period A and period B is denoted as IFR A,B–A. It is a forward
rate on a bond that starts in period A and ends in period B. Its tenor is B − A periods.
     Equation 11 is a general formula for the relationship between the two spot rates
(zA , zB) and the implied forward rate (IFR A,B–A):

While our examples so far have focused on government benchmark rates, we now
turn our attention to short-term market reference rates. Assume, for example, that
today we observe a current three-month MRR of 1.25% and a current six-month
MRR of 1.75%. How can we solve for the three-month implied forward MRR in three
months’ time (IFR3m, 3m)?
    In order to apply Equation 11 in this case, we must first ensure that the time frames,
or periodicities, of the interest rates are the same. Here, the six-month rate has two
periods per year and the three-month rate has four. Recall from an earlier fixed-income
lesson that we can convert an annual percentage rate for m periods per year, denoted
as APRm, into an annual percentage rate for n periods per year, APRn, as follows:
                    m                           n
   	​(1 + _
          ​ m ​)​ ​ = ​(1 + _
                            ​ n ​)​ ​.​	
          AP ​Rm
               ​​                   AP ​Rn​ ​
                                                                                                (12)
First, we must convert the 1.75% semiannual MRR into a quarterly rate:

   (1 + APR4/4)4 = (1 + 0.0175/2)2

               APR4 = 1.74619%
   We can use this to solve Equation 11 for IFR3m,3m:
   (1 + z3m/4) × (1 + IFR3m,3m/4) = (1 + z6m/4)2

   (1 + 0.0125/4) × (1 + IFR3m,3m/4) = (1 + 0.0174619/4)2

   IFR3m,3m = 2.24299%
Our result can be confirmed by showing that CNY100,000,000 invested at:
   1. 1.25% for three months and reinvested at 2.24299% for the following three
      months, or
   2. 1.75% for six months

                             will both return CNY100,875,000 in six months:
                             1. CNY100,875,000 (= CNY100,000,000 × (1 + 0.0125/4) × (1 + 0.0224299/4))
                             2. CNY100,875,000 (= CNY100,000,000 × (1 + 0.0175/2))
                              As we will see in the next section, this breakeven reinvestment rate between zero
                          rates of different maturities establishes a no-arbitrage price for a one-period interest
                          rate forward contract.

                          Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs)
                          An OTC derivatives contract in which counterparties agree to apply a specific inter-
                          est rate to a future period is a forward rate agreement (FRA). The underlying is a
                          hypothetical deposit of a notional amount in the future at a market reference rate that
                          is fixed at contract inception (t = 0). The FRA buyer, or long position, agrees to pay
                          the deposit interest based on the agreed upon fixed rate and receives deposit interest
                          based on a market reference rate that begins in A periods and ends in B periods (with
                          a tenor of B − A periods) and is determined on or just before the forward settlement
                          date at time t = A.
                               Exhibit 9 shows FRA mechanics at t = 0 and settlement at time A.

                          If Exhibit 9 looks familiar, it is because an FRA is a one-period version of the interest
                          rate swap introduced as a series of exchanges in an earlier lesson. Similar to the swap,
                          fixed versus floating payments on an FRA occur on a net basis and the notional is
                          not exchanged but is used solely for interest calculations. The implied forward rates
                          shown in the previous section represent the FRA fixed rate for a given period where no
                          riskless profit opportunities exist. This no-arbitrage interest rate ensures that, similar
                          to other forward contracts, the forward rate agreement has a value of zero (V0(T) = 0)
                          to both parties at inception. FRA settlement and other details are best demonstrated
                          by extending our earlier implied forward rate example.

EXAMPLE 8

   CNY Forward Rate Agreement
   In a prior example, we solved for a three-month implied forward MRR in three
   months’ time (IFR3m,3m) of 2.24299%. Yangzi Bank enters into an agreement to
   pay the three-month rate in three months’ time and receive MRR as in Exhibit
   9. Yangzi Bank uses the FRA to offset or hedge an underlying liability in three
   months on which it will owe MRR.
       Consider the following FRA term sheet:

       Similar to forward agreements for other underlying assets, the FRA settlement
   amount is a function of the difference between F0(T) (here, a forward interest
   rate, IFR A,B-A) and ST (the market reference rate MRRB-A, or the MRR for B −
   A periods, which ends at time B). In our example, MRR3m is the three-month
   market reference rate, which sets in three months’ time. FRAs are usually cash
   settled at the beginning of the period during which the reference rate applies.
   We calculate the net payment amount from the perspective of Yangzi Bank
   (the FRA buyer or fixed-rate payer) at the end of the interest period as follows:
       Net Payment = (MRRB-A − IFR A,B-A) × Notional Principal × Period
       If MRRB-A in three months’ time sets at 2.15% and we assume a 90-day
   interest period, we calculate the net payment at the end of the period as follows:
       Net Payment = (MRRB-A − IFR A,B-A) × Notional Principal × Period
       (2.15% − 2.24299%) × CNY100,000,000 × 90/360
       = −CNY23,247.50
       This is the net payment amount at the end of six months. However, the FRA
   settles at the beginning rather than the end of the interest period, which is three
   months in our example. We must therefore calculate the present value of the
   settlement amount to the beginning of the period during which the reference
   rate applies, using MRRB-A as the discount rate:
       Cash Settlement (PV): −CNY23,123.21 = −CNY23,247.50/(1 + 0.0215/4)

                                In this case, since MRRB-A sets below the fixed rate, as the fixed-rate payer
                            and floating-rate (MRRB-A) receiver, Yangzi Bank must make a net settlement
                            payment to the financial intermediary. Because Yangzi Bank has used the FRA to
                            offset or hedge an underlying liability on which it owes MRR, the net settlement
                            payment it makes on the FRA is offset by a lower MRR payment on its liability.

                             Forward rate agreements are almost exclusively used by financial intermediaries
                          to manage rate-sensitive assets or liabilities on their balance sheets. The forward rate
                          agreement and its single-period swap equivalent that settles at the end of an interest
                          period form the basic building blocks for interest rate swaps, which are more frequently
                          used by issuers and investors to manage interest rate risk.

                               at maturity in one period are _________. The price equivalent of a zero
                               rate is the present value of a currency unit on a future date, known as a
                               _______________.
                               Solution:
                               The yield-to-maturity rate and the zero rate for a bond with a single cash
                               flow at maturity in one period are identical. The price equivalent of a zero
                               rate is the present value of a currency unit on a future date, known as a
                               discount factor.

                            2. An analyst observes three- and four-year government benchmark zero-cou-
                               pon bonds priced at 93 and 90 per 100 face value, respectively. Calculate
                               IFR3,1 (the implied one-year forward rate in three years’ time).
                               Solution:
                               First, use the three-year (DF3) and four-year (DF4) discount factors provided
                               per unit of currency to derive three-year (z3) and four-year (z4) zero rates,
                               which can be calculated as follows:

      	​D ​Fi​​ = _
               ​(1 + ​z​i​)​​

      Therefore:
      0.93 = 1/(1 + z3)3; z3 = 2.4485%
      0.90 = 1/(1 + z4)4; z4 = 2.6690%
      Solve for IFR3,1 as follows:
      (1 + z3)3 × (1 + IFR3,1) = (1 + z4)4
      (1.024485)3 × (1 + IFR3,1) = (1.02669)4
      IFR3,1 = 3.3333%

   3. Match the following descriptions with their corresponding interest rate
      derivative building block.
                                             ​




    A. Forward rate agreement               1. The breakeven reinvestment rate linking
                                            a short-dated and long-dated zero-coupon
                                            bond
    B. Implied forward rate                 2. The present value of a currency unit on
                                            a future date
    C. Discount factor                      3. A derivative in which counterparties
                                            agree to apply a specific interest rate to a
                                            future time period
                                             ​




      Solution:
      1. B is correct. The breakeven reinvestment rate linking a short-dated and a
      long-dated zero-coupon bond is the implied forward rate.
      2. C is correct. The price equivalent of a zero rate is the present value of a
      currency unit on a future date, known as a discount factor.
      3. A is correct. A forward rate agreement is a derivative in which counter-
      parties agree to apply a specific interest rate to a future period.

   4. A trader observes one-year and two-year zero-coupon bonds that yield 4%
      and 5%, respectively, and would like to protect herself against a rise in one-
      year rates a year from now. Explain the position she should take in the FRA
      contract to achieve this objective and the forward interest rate she should
      expect on the contract.
      Solution:
      A forward rate agreement involves an underlying hypothetical future depos-
      it at a market reference rate fixed at contract inception (t = 0). To protect
      against higher rates, the trader should enter into a fixed-rate payer FRA in
      order to realize a gain if one-year spot rates one year from now exceed the
      current forward rate. A long FRA position, or fixed-rate payer, agrees to
      pay interest based on the fixed rate and receives interest based on a variable
      market reference rate determined at settlement. The FRA is priced based on
      the implied forward rate, or breakeven reinvestment rate between a shorter
      and a longer zero rate. We can solve for IFR1,1 as follows:
      (1 + z1) × (1 + IFR1,1) = (1 + z2)2
      (1.04) × (1 + IFR1,1) = (1.05)2
      IFR1,1 = 6.0096%

   5. A counterparty agrees to be the FRA fixed-rate receiver on a one-month
      AUD MRR in three months’ time based on a AUD150,000,000 notional
      amount. If IFR3m,1m at contract inception is 0.50% and one-month AUD

                                                                                                   Maturities

                          MRR sets at 0.35% for settlement of the contract, calculate the settlement
                          amount and interpret the results.
                          Solution:
                          A short FRA position, or fixed-rate receiver, agrees to pay interest based on
                          a market reference rate determined at settlement and receives interest based
                          on a pre-agreed fixed rate, the implied forward rate (IFR3m,1m). Since AUD
                          MRRB-A at settlement is below the pre-agreed fixed rate, the FRA fixed-rate
                          receiver realizes a gain and receives a net payment based on the following
                          calculation:
                          Net Payment = (IFR A,B-A − MRRB-A) × Notional Principal × Period
                          = (0.50% − 0.35%) × AUD150,000,000 × (1/12)
                          = AUD18,750 at the end of the period
                          Solve for the present value of settlement given the contract is settled at the
                          beginning of the period, using MRRB-A as the discount rate:
                          Cash Settlement (PV) = AUD18,750.00/(1 + 0.35%/12)
                          = AUD18,744.53

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS


The following information relates to questions
1-6
    Baywhite Financial is a broker-dealer and wealth management firm that helps
    its clients manage their portfolios using stand-alone derivative strategies. A new
    Baywhite analyst is asked to evaluate the following client situations.

1. Match the following definitions with their corresponding forward pricing or
   valuation component.

1. Equal to the difference between the           A. Forward contract MTM value at inception,
current spot price (adjusted by remaining        V0(T)
costs and benefits through maturity) and
the present value of the forward price
2. Future value of the underlying asset          B. Forward contract MTM value between
spot price (S0) compounded at the                inception and maturity, Vt(T)
risk-free rate incorporating the present
value of the costs and benefits of asset
ownership
3. Under no-arbitrage conditions for a           C. Forward price, F0(T)
given underlying spot price, S0, adjusted
by the costs and benefits, risk-free rate (r),
and forward price, F0(T), this should be
equal to zero (ignoring transaction costs).


2. A Baywhite client currently owns 5,000 common non-dividend-paying shares
   of Vivivyu Inc. (VIVU), a digital media company, at a spot price of USD173 per
   share. The client enters into a forward commitment to sell half of its VIVU posi-
   tion in six months at a price of USD175.58. Which of the following market events
   is most likely to result in the greatest gain in the VIVU forward contract MTM
   value from the client’s perspective?
    A. An increase in the risk-free rate

    B. An immediate decline in the VIVU spot price following contract inception

    C. A steady rise in the spot price of VIVU stock over time

3. A Baywhite client has entered into a long six-month MXN/USD FX forward
   contract—that is, an agreement to sell MXN and buy USD. The MXN/USD spot
   exchange rate at inception is 19.8248 (MXN19.8248 = USD1), the six-month
   MXN risk-free rate is 4.25%, and the six-month USD risk-free rate is 0.5%.
   Baywhite’s market strategist predicts that the Mexican central bank (Banco de
   Mexico) will surprise the market with a 50 bp short-term rate cut at its upcoming
   meeting. Which of the following statements best describes how the client’s exist-
   ing FX forward contract will be impacted if this prediction is realized and other
   parameters remain unchanged?
    A. The lower interest rate differential between MXN and USD will cause the
       MXN/USD contract forward rate to be adjusted downward.
126   Learning Module 5                Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts and for an Underlying with Varying
                                                                                                          Maturities

                             B. The client will realize an MTM gain on the FX forward contract due to the
                                decline in the MXN versus USD interest rate differential.

                             C. The lower interest rate differential between MXN and USD will cause the
                                client to realize an MTM loss on the MXN/USD forward contract.

                          4. A client seeking advice on her fixed-income portfolio observes the price and
                             yield-to-maturity of one-year (r1) and two-year (r2) annual coupon government
                             benchmark bonds currently available in the market. Which of the following state-
                             ments best describes how the analyst can determine a breakeven reinvestment
                             rate in one year’s time to help decide whether to invest now for one or two years?
                             A. As the two-year rate involves intermediate cash flows, divide the square root
                                of (1 + r2) by (1 + r1) and subtract 1 to arrive at a breakeven reinvestment
                                rate for one year in one year’s time.

                             B. Since the first year’s returns are compounded in the second year, set (1 + r1)
                                multiplied by 1 plus the breakeven reinvestment rate equal to (1 + r2)2 and
                                solve for the breakeven reinvestment rate.

                             C. Since the breakeven reinvestment involves a zero-coupon cash flow, first
                                substitute the one-year rate (r1) into the two-year bond price equation
                                to solve for the two-year spot or zero rate (z2), then set (1 + r1) × (1 +
                                breakeven reinvestment rate) = (1 + z2)2 and solve for the breakeven rein-
                                vestment rate.

                          5. Baywhite Financial seeks to gain a competitive advantage by making margin loans
                             at fixed rates for up to 60 days to its investor clients. Since Baywhite borrows at a
                             variable one-month market reference rate to finance these client loans, the firm
                             enters into one-month FRA contracts on one-month MRR to hedge the interest
                             rate exposure of its margin loan book. Which of the following statements best
                             describes Baywhite’s interest rate exposure and the FRA position it should take to
                             hedge that exposure?
                             A. Baywhite faces exposure to a rise in one-month MRR over the next 30 days,
                                so it should enter into the FRA as a fixed-rate payer in order to benefit from
                                a rise in one-month MRR above the FRA rate and offset its higher borrow-
                                ing cost.

                             B. Baywhite faces exposure to a rise in one-month MRR over the next 30 days,
                                so it should enter into the FRA as a fixed-rate receiver in order to benefit
                                from a rise in one-month MRR above the FRA rate and offset its higher
                                borrowing cost.

                             C.    Baywhite faces exposure to a decline in one-month MRR over the next 30
                                  days, so it should enter into the FRA as a fixed-rate receiver in order to ben-
                                  efit from a rise in one-month MRR above the FRA rate and offset its higher
                                  borrowing cost.

                          6. Baywhite observes that one-month MRR is 1.2% and two-month MRR is 1.5%.
                             Which of the following rates is closest to the forward rate that Baywhite would
                             expect on 1m1m forward rate agreement?
                             A. 1.80%

                             B. 1.35%

                             C. 3.55%
Solutions                                                                                  127




   SOLUTIONS
1. 1. B is correct. The forward contract MTM value between inception and matu-
   rity, Vt(T), is equal to the difference between the current spot price (adjusted by
   costs and benefits through maturity) and the present value of the forward price.
   2. C is correct. The forward price, F0(T), is the future value of the underlying
   asset spot price (S0) compounded at the risk-free rate incorporating the present
   value of the costs and benefits of asset ownership.
   3. A is correct. Under no-arbitrage conditions for a given underlying spot price,
   S0, adjusted by the costs and benefits, risk-free rate (r), and forward price, F0(T),
   the forward contract MTM value at inception, V0(T), should be equal to zero
   (ignoring transaction costs).

2. B is correct. The original VIVU spot price (S0) at t = 0 must equal the present
   value of the forward price discounted at the risk-free rate, so an immediate fall in
   the spot price to S0- < S0 results in an MTM gain for the forward contract seller.
   A is not correct, since a higher risk-free rate will reduce the contract MTM from
   the client’s perspective by reducing the PV of F0(T), while C will also reduce the
   forward contract MTM from the seller’s perspective.

3. C is correct. A decline in the interest rate differential between MXN and USD
   will cause the client to realize an MTM loss on the MXN/USD forward contract,
   while B states that this decline will result in an MTM gain. A is incorrect as the
   forward price, F0(T), is not adjusted during the contract life.
   Specifically, the original MXN/USD forward exchange rate at inception is equal
   to 20.20 (= 19.8248e(.0425 – 0.005) × 0.5). If the MXN rate were to decline by 50
   bps immediately after the contract is agreed, a new MXN/USD forward con-
   tract would be at a forward exchange rate of 20.15 (= 19.8248e(.0375 – 0.005) × 0.5).
   The MXN would weaken or depreciate against the USD. Since the MXN seller
   has locked in a forward sale at the original 20.20 versus the new 20.15 rate, the
   seller’s MTM loss is equal to 0.05, or MXN50,000 per MXN1,000,000 (= 0.05 ×
   1,000,000) notional amount.

4. C is correct. The one-year annual rate equals the one-year zero rate, as it involves
   a single cash flow at maturity (z1 = r1). Since the breakeven reinvestment rate
   involves a single cash flow at maturity, substitute the one-year rate (r1) into the
   two-year bond price equation to solve for z2, then set (1 + r1) × (1 + breakev-
   en reinvestment rate) = (1 + z2)2 and solve for the breakeven reinvestment rate
   (IFR1,1).

5. A is correct. As Baywhite faces exposure to a rise in one-month MRR over the
   next 30 days, it should enter into the FRA as a fixed-rate payer in order to benefit
   from a rise in one-month MRR above the FRA rate and offset its higher borrow-
   ing cost. Both B and C are incorrect, as the fixed-rate receiver in an FRA does not
   benefit but rather must make a higher payment upon settlement if MRR rises.

6. A is correct. The APR of the monthly compounded two-month rate is 1.499%.
   Dividing (1.01499/12)2 by (1.012/12) equals 1.001499. Subtracting 1 and then
   multiplying by 12 gives 1.7982%. Thus, the approximate forward rate is 1.80%. B
   is incorrect because this is a simple average of the two spot rates. C is incorrect
   because this result is derived from simply dividing (1.01499/12) by (1.012/12),
   then subtracting 1, and then multiplying by 12.

Pricing and Valuation of Futures Contracts
 LEARNING OUTCOMES
  Mastery     The candidate should be able to:

              compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts
              explain why forward and futures prices differ




INTRODUCTION
Many of the pricing and valuation principles associated with forward commitments
                                                                                            1
are common to both forward and futures contracts. For example, previous lessons
demonstrated that forward commitments have a price that prevents market partici-
pants from earning riskless profit through arbitrage. It was also shown that long and
short forward commitments may be replicated using a combination of long or short
cash positions and borrowing or lending at the risk-free rate. Finally, both forward
and futures pricing and valuation incorporate the cost of carry, or the benefits and
costs of owning an underlying asset over the life of a derivative contract.
    We now turn our attention to futures contracts. We discuss what distinguishes
them from other forward commitments and how they are used by issuers and investors.
We expand upon the daily settlement of futures contract gains and losses introduced
earlier and explain the differences between forwards and futures. We also address
and distinguish the interest rate futures market and its role in interest rate derivative
contracts.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Futures are standardized, exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs)
           with zero initial value and a futures price f0(T) established at

                              ■   The cumulative realized mark-to-market (MTM) gain or loss on a
                                  futures contract is approximately the same as for a comparable for-
                                  ward contract.
                              ■   Daily settlement and margin requirements give rise to different cash
                                  flow patterns between futures and forwards, resulting in a pricing
                                  difference between the two contract types. The difference depends on
                                  both interest rate volatility and the correlation between interest rates
                                  and futures prices.
                              ■   The futures price for short-term interest rate futures is given by (100
                                  – yield), where yield is expressed in percentage terms. There is a price
                                  difference between interest rate futures and forward rate agreements
                                  (FRAs) due to convexity bias.

                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. Which of the following responses is closest to the one-year futures price of
                              a stock with a spot price (S0) of €125 and an annual dividend of €2.50 paid at
                              maturity if the risk-free rate is 1%?
                              A. €123.75
                              B. €122.50
                              C. €126.25
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. The no arbitrage futures price for an underlying asset with
                             known benefits, such as a dividend, may be determined using the following
                             equation:
                             f 0(T) = [S0 − PV0(I)] (1 + r)T.
                             First, solve for the present value of the dividend PV0(I) as follows:
                             €2.48 = (€2.50 / 1.01).
                             Substitute PV0(I) into the original equation to solve for f0(T):
                             f 0(T) = €123.75 = (€125 − €2.48)(1.01).

                           2. Which of the following statements regarding the gains or losses of a long
                              forward contract position compared to a long futures contract position is
                              most correct? Assume that the underlying is identical on both contracts and
                              that both contracts have the same time until maturity.
                              A. The daily realized gain or loss of the forward contract position and the
                                 futures contract position are equivalent.
                              B. Before the contracts mature, the cumulative realized gains or losses
                                 of the forward contract position and the futures contract position are
                                 equivalent.
Introduction                                                                              131


      C. At contract maturity, the cumulative realized gains or losses of the for-
         ward contract position and the futures contract position are approxi-
         mately equivalent.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The two contracts are similar in all respects except for the
     frequency with which contracts are marked to market. As a result, the cu-
     mulative gain or loss is approximately the same when the contracts mature.
     A is incorrect because the futures contract’s daily mark-to-market (MTM)
     feature creates daily realized gains or losses while the forward contract’s
     gains or losses are realized only at contract maturity. B is incorrect because
     the response refers to realized gains or losses, and the contracts have not
     yet matured. Thus, the forward contract has generated no realized gains or
     losses yet.

  3. Identify which of the following situations leads to which relationship be-
     tween forward and futures prices for forward commitment contracts with
     otherwise identical terms.
                                               ​




    1. Futures prices are positively correlated with   A. Forward prices are above
    interest rates, and interest rates change over     futures prices: F0(T) > f0(T).
    the contract period.
    2. Futures prices are negatively correlated with B. Forward and futures prices are
    interest rates, and interest rates change over   the same: F0(T) = f0(T).
    the contract period.
    3. Interest rates are constant over the forward    C. Futures prices are above for-
    commitment contract period.                        ward prices: f0(T) > F0(T).
                                               ​




     Solution:
     1. C is correct. If futures prices are positively correlated with interest rates,
     then higher prices lead to futures profits reinvested at rising rates, and lower
     prices lead to losses that may be financed at lower rates.
     2. A is correct. If futures prices are negatively correlated with interest rates,
     then higher prices lead to futures profits reinvested at lower rates, and lower
     prices lead to losses that must be financed at higher rates.
     3. B is correct. If interest rates are constant over the forward commitment
     contract period, then forward and futures prices are the same.

  4. Which of the following statements most correctly describes a development
     that has helped reduce the difference in the cash flow impact between for-
     ward and futures contracts?
      A. Futures exchanges have moved away from daily mark-to-market recog-
         nition of gains and losses on futures contracts.
      B. OTC derivatives have become increasingly subject to central clearing
         requirements.
      C. Lower volatility in markets has reduced the magnitude of gains and
         losses in both types of contracts.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Under a central clearing framework for OTC derivatives, finan-
     cial intermediaries that serve as counterparties are required to post daily
     margin or eligible collateral to the central counterparty (CCP) in a process
     very similar to futures margining. Dealers, therefore, often impose simi-
     lar requirements on derivatives end users. A is incorrect because no such

                                   change has occurred in exchange-traded futures markets. C is incorrect be-
                                   cause volatility changes over time are hard to categorize as higher or lower.




              2           PRICING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS AT INCEPTION

                                           compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts

                          When a forward commitment is initiated, no cash is exchanged and the contract
                          is neither an asset nor a liability to the buyer or seller. The value of both a forward
                          contract and a futures contract at initiation is zero:
                             V0(T) = 0.                                                                                (1)
                          An underlying asset with no cost or benefit has a futures price f0(T) at t = 0 of:
                             f0(T) = S0(1 + r)T,                                                                       (2)
                          where r is the risk-free rate and T is the time to maturity. As in the case of a forward
                          contract, the futures price is the spot price compounded at the risk-free rate over the
                          life of the contract. This is shown in Exhibit 1, where the slope of the line is equal to
                          the risk-free rate, r.

                          As for forwards, we use discrete compounding as in Equation 2 for futures on indi-
                          vidual underlying assets. However, for underlying assets that are comprised of a
                          portfolio—such as an equity, fixed-income, commodity, or credit index—or where
                          the underlying involves foreign exchange with interest rates denominated in two cur-
                          rencies, continuous compounding is the preferred method, as shown in Equation 3:
                             f0(T) = S0erT.                                                                            (3)

                             Procam Investments - Gold Futures Contract
                             As shown in a previous lesson, Procam Investments purchases a 100-ounce gold
                             futures contract. The current spot price is $1,770.00 per ounce, the risk-free rate
                             is 2.0%, and we assume gold may be stored at no cost. Calculate the no arbitrage
                             futures price, f0(T), for settlement in 91 days (T = 91/365 or 0.24932).

   Solution
   Using Equation 2: f0(T) = S0(1 + r)T
            $1,778.76 per ounce = $1,770.00 × (1.02)0.24932

            Contract price = $177,876.04 (= 100 × $1,778.76)
   The futures price, f0(T), is identical to the forward price from a previous lesson.

    As in the case of a forward, for underlying assets with ownership benefits or
income (I) or costs (C) expressed as a known amount in present value terms at time t
= 0, the spot versus futures price relationship using discrete compounding is shown
in Equation 4 and Exhibit 2:
   f0(T) = [S0 – PV0(I) + PV0(C)] (1 + r)T.                                               (4)

EXAMPLE 2

   Procam’s Gold Futures Contract with Storage Costs
   Procam purchased a gold futures contract in Example 1 at f0(T) of $177,876.04
   (or $1,778.76 per ounce) with S0 equal to $1,770 per ounce. How would f0(T)
   change to satisfy the no arbitrage condition if a $2 per ounce cost of gold storage
   and insurance were payable at the end of the contract?
       The futures price for a commodity with known storage cost amounts may
   be determined using Equation 4, where PV0(I) = 0:
            f0(T) = [S0 + PV0(C)] (1 + r)T.
   First, solve for the present value of the storage cost per ounce, PV0(C), as follows:
            PV0(C) = $1.99 = [$2(1.02)0.24982].
   Substitute PV0(C) = $1.99 into Equation 4 to solve for f0(T):
            f0(T) = ($1,770.00 + $1.99)(1.02)0.24982

            = $1,780.78 per ounce
   The addition of storage and insurance costs increases the difference between
   the spot price and futures price. Finally, as in the case of forwards, a futures
   price, f0(T), significantly below the no arbitrage price including cash costs and
   benefits may indicate the presence of a convenience yield.

                                        compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts

                          Examples 1 and 2 show the similarities between forward and futures prices at contract
                          inception. Over time, different forward and futures contract features lead to different
                          MTM values for contracts with the same underlying assets and otherwise identical
                          details. Example 3 shows how the daily settlement of gains and losses causes this
                          difference to arise.

                            We extend the earlier example to compare forward and futures pricing and
                            valuation. In both cases, Procam Investments enters a cash-settled forward
                            commitment to buy 100 ounces of gold at a price (f0[T] = F0[T]) of $1,778.76
                            per ounce in 91 days, with a risk-free rate of 2% and no gold storage cost.

                            Forward Contract
                            The forward price is F0(T) = $1,778.76 per ounce. No cash is exchanged or
                            deposited at inception, and the contract value at inception, V0(T), is zero.

                               Over time, the forward price, F0(T), does not change, and the MTM at any
                            time, [Vt(T)], equals the difference between the current spot price, St, and the
                            present value of the forward price, PVt of F0(T), shown from Procam’s (the
                            forward buyer’s) perspective:
                                Vt(T) = St − F0(T)(1 + r)–(T–t).
                            For example, say 71 days have elapsed and 20 days remain to maturity, T − t =
                            20/365 or 0.0548. If the gold spot price, (St), has fallen by $50 since inception
                            to $1,720 per ounce, solve for Vt(T) as follows:
                                Vt(T) = $1,720 − $1,778.76(1.02)–0.0548

                                = –$56.83 per ounce, or a $5,683 MTM loss (= –$56.83 × 100 ounces).
                            Under terms of the forward contract, no settlement of the MTM amount occurs
                            until maturity. This process of resetting the contract value to zero each day makes
                            it very unlikely that the futures contract would reach a similar MTM value.

  Futures Contract
  The futures price, f0(T), is $1,778.76 per ounce. As per futures exchange daily
  settlement rules, the contract buyer and seller must post an initial cash margin
  of $4,950 per gold contract (100 ounces) and maintain a maintenance margin of
  $4,500 per contract. If a margin balance falls below $4,500, a counterparty receives
  a margin call and must immediately replenish its account to the initial $4,950.

     Consider the first day of trading, where the spot gold price, (S0), is $1,770
  per ounce and the opening gold futures price, f0(T), is $1,778.76 per ounce.
      ■   Assume that the gold futures price, f1(T), falls by $5 on the first
          trading day to $1,773.76 and the spot price, S1, ends the day at a no
          arbitrage equivalent of $1,765.12 (= $1,773.76(1.02)–90/365).
      ■   Procam realizes a $500 MTM loss (= $5 per ounce × 100 ounces)
          deducted from its margin account, leaving Procam with $4,450.
      ■   The MTM value of Procam’s futures contract resets to zero at the
          futures closing price of $1,773.76 per ounce.
      ■   Since Procam’s margin account balance has fallen below the $4,500
          maintenance level, it must deposit $500 to return the balance to the
          $4,950 initial margin.

                              Example 3 demonstrates the key differences in the price and value of forward and
                          futures contracts over time. The forward contract price, F0(T), remains fixed until the
                          contract matures. Forward contract MTM value changes are captured by the differ-
                          ence between the current spot price, St, and the present value of the forward price,
                          PVt[F0(T)]. This forward contract MTM is not settled until maturity, giving rise to
                          counterparty credit risk over time since no cash is exchanged from inception of the
                          contract to its maturity or expiration. Futures contract prices fluctuate daily based
                          upon market changes. The daily settlement mechanism resets the futures MTM to
                          zero, and variation margin is exchanged to settle the difference, reducing counter-
                          party credit risk. The cumulative realized MTM gain or loss on a futures contract is
                          approximately the same as for a comparable forward contract. We will explore these
                          differences in the next lesson after first turning our attention to forward and futures
                          contracts on market reference rates.

                                        compare the value and price of forward and futures contracts

                          In an earlier lesson on interest rate forward contracts, zero rates derived from coupon
                          bonds were used to derive a future investment breakeven rate (or implied forward rate).
                          The implied forward rate was shown to equal the no arbitrage fixed rate on a forward
                          rate agreement (FRA) under which counterparties exchange a fixed-for-floating cash
                          flow at a time in the future.
Interest Rate Futures versus Forward Contracts                                                   137


    Futures markets on short-term interest rates offer market participants a highly
liquid, standardized alternative to FRAs. Interest rate futures contracts are available
for monthly or quarterly market reference rates for successive periods out to final
contract maturities of up to ten years in the future. Although the underlying variable
is the market reference rate (MRR) on a hypothetical deposit on a future date as for
forward rate agreements, interest rate futures trade on a price basis as per the fol-
lowing general formula:
   fA,B−A = 100 − (100 × MRRA,B−A),                                                        (5)
   where fA,B−A represents the futures price for a market reference rate for B−A
periods that begins in A periods (MRRA,B−A), as shown in Exhibit 3.

                                                             Underlying MRR

For example, we may solve for the implied three-month MRR rate in three months’
time (where A = 3m, B = 6m, B − A = 3m) if an interest rate futures contract is trading
at a price of 98.25 using Equation 5:
   f3m,3m: 98.25 = 100 − (100 × MRRA,B−A)

   MRR3m,3m = 1.75%.
This (100 − yield) price convention results in an inverse price/yield relationship but is
not the same as the price of a zero-coupon bond at the contract rate. A long futures
position involves earning or receiving MRR in A periods, whereas a short position
involves paying MRR in A periods. The interest rate exposure profile for long and
short futures contracts are as follows:
    ■     Long futures contract (lender): Gains as prices rise, future MRR falls
    ■     Short futures contract (borrower): Gains as prices fall, future MRR rises
    In an earlier lesson, Yangzi Bank enters into an FRA as a fixed-rate payer to hedge
a liability on which it owes MRR in the future, realizing a gain on the FRA contract
as rates rise. Note that this would be equivalent to taking a short position on a CNY
MRR futures contract if one were available. Exhibit 4 summarizes the relationship
between futures and FRAs.

                          Interest rate futures daily settlement occurs based on price changes, which translate
                          into futures contract basis point value (BPV) as follows:
                             Futures Contract BPV = Notional Principal × 0.01% × Period.                                 (6)
                          For example, assuming a $1,000,000 notional for three-month MRR of 2.21% for one
                          quarter (or 90/360 days), the underlying deposit contract value would be:
                             $1,005,525 = $1,000,000 × [1 + (2.21% / 4)].
                          Consider how a one basis point (0.01%) change in MRR affects contract value:
                             1 bp increase (2.22%): $1,005,550 = $1,000,000 × [1 + (2.22% / 4)].

                             1 bp decrease (2.20%): $1,005,500 = $1,000,000 × [1 + (2.20% / 4)].
                          Both the increase and decrease in MRR by one basis point change the contract BPV
                          by $25. Short-term interest rate futures are characterized by a fixed linear relationship
                          between price and yield changes. The following example illustrates their use in practice.

                             time (MRR1,1), which would reduce the return on its fixed margin loans. In the
                             prior example, Baywhite entered an FRA where it agreed to pay fixed one-month
                             MRR and receive floating. If Baywhite were to use an interest rate futures con-
                             tract instead, it would sell a futures contract on one-month MRR. The futures
                             contract BPV for a $50,000,000 notional amount is:
                                Contract BPV = $416.67 (= $50,000,000 × 0.01% × [1/12]).
                             If Baywhite sells f1,1 for $98.75 (or MRR1,1 = 1.25%) and settles at maturity at
                             a price of $97.75 (MRR1,1 = 2.25%), it would expect to have a cumulative gain
                             on the contract through maturity equal to $41,667 (= Contract BPV × 100 bps).

   Valuation and Pricing of Futures Contracts

   1. Identify which of the following features corresponds to which type of for-
      ward commitment contract.
                                              ​




    1. The daily change in contract price is used to A. Forward contract
    determine and settle the MTM.
    2. Inclusion of storage and insurance costs      B. Futures contract
    increases the difference between the spot and
    forward commitment contract price.
    3. The contract price established at inception   C. Both a forward and a futures
    remains unchanged over time.                     contract
                                              ​




        Solution:
        1. B is correct. The futures contract price change at the close of each trading
        day is used to determine the daily MTM settlement via the margin account.
        2. C is correct. Storage and insurance costs increase the forward commit-
        ment price for both forward and futures contracts.
        3. A is correct. The forward contract price, F0(T), established at t = 0 re-
        mains unchanged and is used to calculate the MTM settlement at maturity.

   2. Calculate the correct answer to fill in the blank and justify your response:
      An investor entered a short oil futures contract position three months ago
      on 1,000 barrels at an initial price of $69.00 per barrel. The constant risk-
      free rate is 0.50%. Daily oil spot and futures prices for the final 10 days of
      trading are shown in the following table. The change in the investor’s futures
      contract value on day T – 5 is closest to _______________.

        Solution:
        The answer is $(1,990). The MTM of the investor’s futures position is the

                              VT−5(T) = – [ –fT−5(T) – fT−6(T)– ] × 1,000 = – (68.01 – 66.02) × 1,000

                             Note the negative sign refers to the investor’s short futures position. The
                             investor realizes a loss as the futures price rises due to the short position.

                           3. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentences: The

                              margin is exchanged to settle the difference. The ___________ realized
                              MTM gain or loss on a futures contract is approximately the same as for a
                              comparable forward contract.
                             Solution:
                             The daily settlement mechanism resets the futures MTM to zero, and mar-
                             gin is exchanged to settle the difference. The cumulative realized MTM gain
                             or loss on a futures contract is approximately the same as for a comparable
                             forward contract.

                           4. Identify the following statement as true or false and justify your answer: An
                              FRA fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer) position is equivalent to a long
                              interest rate futures contract on MRR, as both positions realize a gain as
                              MRR falls below the initial fixed rate.
                             Solution:
                             The statement is true. An FRA fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer) posi-
                             tion realizes a gain as MRR falls as the counterparty receives the fixed MRR
                             and owes the floating MRR in the future. A long futures contract price is
                             based on (100 − yield), which rises as yield-to-maturity (MRR) falls.

                              night Index Average) futures contract expiring in June 2021 traded at a price
                              above 100. Describe the interest rate scenario implied by this futures price
                              and justify your response.
                             Solution:
                             The future interest rate scenario implied by the futures price above 100 is a
                             negative SONIA interest rate in June 2021. For example, if we consider the
                             futures price for three-month SONIA one year forward as of June 2020 from
                             Equation 5:
                              f1y,3m = 100 − (100 × MRR1y,3m) .
                             If f1y,3m > 100, this implies that MRR1y,3m < 0.

Despite their similar symmetric payoff profile at maturity, differences exist between
forward and futures valuation and pricing because of different cash flow profiles over
the life of a futures versus a forward contract with otherwise similar characteristics.
The distinguishing features of a futures contract are the posting of initial margin, daily
mark-to-market, and settlement of gains and losses.
    These features limit the MTM value of a futures contract to the daily gain or loss
since the previous day’s settlement. When that value is paid out in the daily settlement
via the margin account, the futures price resets to the current settlement price and
the MTM value goes to zero. Forward contracts, on the other hand, involve privately
negotiated credit terms (which sometimes involve cash or securities collateral) and
do not require daily MTM cash settlement. Forward contract settlement occurs at
maturity in a one-time cash settlement of the cumulative change in contract value.
    The different patterns of cash flows for forwards and futures can lead to a difference
in the pricing of forwards versus futures. Forward and futures prices are identical
under certain conditions, namely:
    ■   if interest rates are constant, or
    ■   if futures prices and interest rates are uncorrelated.
     On the other hand, violations of these assumptions can give rise to differences
in pricing between these two contracts. For example, if futures prices are positively
correlated with interest rates, long futures contracts are more attractive than long
forward positions for the same underlying and maturity. The reason is because rising
prices lead to futures profits that are reinvested in periods of rising interest rates, and
falling prices lead to losses that occur in periods of falling interest rates. The price
differential will also vary with the volatility of interest rates.
     A negative correlation between futures prices and interest rates leads to the opposite
interpretation, with long forward positions being more desirable than long futures
positions. In general, the more desirable contract will tend to have the higher price.

               explain why forward and futures prices differ

The short maturity of most futures contracts and the ability of most market partici-
pants to borrow near risk-free rates for these maturities typically results in little to no
distinction between futures and forward prices. An exception to this is the so-called
convexity bias, which arises given the difference in price changes for interest rate
futures versus forward contracts, as illustrated in the following example.

EXAMPLE 5

   Interest Rate Forwards versus Futures
   Let us return to an example from the prior lesson with an interest rate futures
   contract of $1,000,000 notional for three-month MRR of 2.21% for one quarter
   (or 90/360 days). Recall that the underlying deposit contract value was:
        $1,005,525 = $1,000,000 × [1 + (2.21% / 4)].
   The contract BPV was shown to be $25 (= $1,000,000 × 0.01% × [1/4]).
142   Learning Module 6                                                              Pricing and Valuation of Futures Contracts


                                 Consider in contrast a $1,000,000 notional FRA on three-month MRR in
                             three months’ time with an identical 2.21% rate. The net payment on the FRA
                             is based upon the difference between MRR and the implied forward rate (IFR):
                                 Net Payment = (MRRB−A − IFRA,B−A) × Notional Principal × Period.
                             For example, if the observed MRR in three months is 2.22% (+0.01%), the net
                             payment at maturity would be $25 (= $1,000,000 × 0.01% × [1/4]). However,
                             the settlement of an FRA is based upon the present value of the final cash flow
                             discounted at MRR, so:
                                 Cash Settlement (PV): $24.86 = $25 /(1 + 0.0222 / 4).
                             If we increase the magnitude of the MRR change at settlement and compare these
                             changes between a long interest rate futures position and a short receive-fixed
                             (pay floating) FRA contract, we arrive at the following result:
                                                                               ​

                              MRR3m,3m                        Settlement (PV)                  Long Futures Settlement

                                      2.01%                         $497.50                                $500

                                      2.21%                            $0                                     $0
                                      2.31%                        ($248.56)                              ($250)
                                      2.41%                        ($497.01)                              ($500)

                             Although the settlement values differ due to different conventions across these
                             instruments, note that while the futures contract has a fixed linear payoff profile
                             for a given basis point change, the FRA settlement does not.

                              In the FRA contract in Example 5, we see that the percentage price change is greater
                          (in absolute value) when MRR falls than when it rises. Although the difference here
                          is very small due to the short forward period, note that this non-linear relationship
                          is the convexity property, which characterizes fixed-income instruments from earlier
                          lessons, as shown in Exhibit 5.

                          The discounting feature of the FRA, which is not present in the futures contract, leads
                          to a convexity bias that is greater for longer discounting periods. You will recall from
                          an earlier lesson that a discount factor is the price equivalent of a zero rate and is the
                          present value of a currency unit on a future date, which may also be interpreted as
                          the price of a zero-coupon cash flow or bond. We will show later how this discount
                          factor is used to price interest rate swaps and other derivatives.

                                                                                             7
               explain why forward and futures prices differ

In periods of market and/or counterparty financial stress, large price movements
combined with a derivative counterparty’s inability to meet a margin call may force
the closeout of a futures transaction prior to maturity. An OTC forward contract with
more flexible credit terms, however, may remain outstanding.
    The advent of derivatives central clearing, introduced in an earlier lesson, has
created futures-like margining requirements for OTC derivative dealers who buy
and sell forwards to derivatives end users. Dealers who are required to post cash or
highly liquid securities to a central counterparty often impose similar requirements
on derivatives end users. These dealer margin requirements reduce the difference
in the cash flow impact of exchange-traded and OTC derivatives. This arrangement
between dealers and their counterparties, shown in Exhibit 6, has been added to the
original central clearing diagram from an earlier lesson.

Investors who actively use both exchange-traded futures or OTC forwards must
therefore maintain sufficient cash or eligible collateral to fulfill margin or collateral
requirements. Market participants must also consider the financing, transaction, and
administrative costs of maintaining these positions when using derivatives in a portfolio.

QUESTION SET

   Forward and Futures Prices

   1. Identify the following statement as true or false and justify your answer: If
      futures prices are positively correlated with interest rates, long futures con-
      tracts are more attractive than long forward positions for the same underly-
      ing and maturity.
      Solution:
      The statement is true. If futures contract prices rise as interest rates rise, a
      long futures contract holder can reinvest futures contract profits at higher
      interest rates.

                          2. An investor seeks to hedge its three-month MRR exposure on a ₤25,000,000
                             liability in two months and observes an implied forward rate today (IF-
                             R2m,3m) of 2.95%. Calculate the settlement amounts if the investor enters
                             a long pay-fixed (receive floating) FRA and a short futures contract, and
                             compare and interpret the results if MRR2m,3m settles at 3.25%.
                            Solution:
                            Solve for the pay-fixed FRA Cash Settlement (PV) value as follows:
                             Net Payment = (MRRB−A – IFRA,B−A) × Notional Principal × Period

                             = ₤18,750 (= [3.25% − 2.95%] × ₤25,000,000 × [1/4]).
                            The present value based upon MRR2m,5m of 3.25% is:
                             = ₤18,598.88 (= ₤18,750 / [1 + 0.0325/4]).
                            For the futures contract, contract BPV is equal to:
                             Contract BPV = ₤625 (= ₤25,000,000 × 0.01% × [1/4]).
                            For a 30-basis point increase in MRR (= 3.25% − 2.95%), the short futures
                            contract will realize a price appreciation of ₤18,750 (= ₤625 × 30). Both
                            contracts result in a gain from the investor’s perspective as MRR rises. How-
                            ever, the futures settlement is larger due to the discounting of the FRA final
                            payment to the settlement date.

                          3. Explain why short futures contracts are more attractive than short forward
                             positions if futures prices are negatively correlated with interest rates for
                             positions with the same underlying and maturity.
                            Solution:
                            The reason that short futures contracts are more attractive than short for-
                            ward positions if futures prices are negatively correlated with interest rates
                            is because falling prices lead to futures profits that are reinvested in periods
                            of rising interest rates, and rising prices lead to losses that occur in periods
                            of falling interest rates.

                          4. Identify the following statement as true or false and justify your answer:

                            The convexity bias between interest rate futures and interest rate forwards
                            causes the percentage price change to be greater (in absolute value) when
                            MRR rises than when it falls for a forward than for a futures contract.
                            Solution:
                            The statement is false. The convexity bias between interest rate futures and
                            interest rate forwards causes the percentage price change to be greater (in
                            absolute value) when MRR falls than when it rises for a forward contract, as
                            opposed to a futures contract.

                          5. Explain how central clearing of derivatives reduces the difference in futures
                             and forward prices for the same underlying and maturity periods.
                            Solution:
                            The central clearing of derivatives has created futures-like margining
                            requirements for OTC derivative dealers who buy and sell forwards to
                            derivatives end users. Dealers who are required to post cash or highly liquid
                            securities to a central counterparty often impose similar requirements on
                            derivatives end users. This arrangement between derivative dealers and their

      counterparties will reduce the difference in the cash flow impact of ETD
      and OTC derivatives. Hence, any price difference between ETD futures and
      OTC forwards will be reduced.

                             PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                          The following information relates to questions
                          1-4
                             Ace Limited is a financial intermediary active in both futures and forward mar-
                             kets. You have been hired as an investment consultant and asked to review Ace’s
                             activities and answer the following questions.

                          1. Ace serves as a futures commission merchant to assist several of its commodity
                             trading adviser (CTA) clients to clear and settle their futures margin positions
                             with the futures exchange. Ace is reviewing the copper futures market for a CTA
                             client considering a long copper futures position for the first time. Details of the
                             copper futures market are as follows:



                            CME Copper Futures Contract Specifications

                          Contract Maturities:        Monthly [from 1 month to 15 months]
                          Contract Size:              25,000 pounds
                          Delivery Type:              Cash settled
                          Price Quotation:            $ per pound
                          Initial Margin:             $10,000 per contract
                          Maintenance Margin:         $6,000 per contract
                          Final Maturity:             Last CME business day of contract month
                          Daily Settlement:           CME Trading Operations calculates daily settlement values
                                                      based on its published procedures

                             Today’s copper spot price is $4.25 per pound, and the constant risk-free rate is
                             1.875%. Each contract has a $10 storage cost payable at the end of the month.
                             Which of the following statements best characterizes the margin exposure profile
                             of Ace’s CTA client if it enters a one-month copper futures contract?
                             A. The CTA will be expected to post $10,000 initial margin and would receive a
                                margin call if the copper futures price were to immediately fall below $4.10
                                per pound or below a price of $102,425 per contract.

                             B. The CTA would be expected to post $10,000 in initial margin and would
                                receive a margin call at any time over the life of the contract if the copper
                                futures price were to immediately fall below $3.86 per pound or below a
                                price of $96,425 per contract.

                             C. The CTA will be expected to post $10,000 initial margin, but we cannot
                                determine the exact futures price at which a margin call will occur as the
                                futures MTM is settled each day and the contract value resets to zero.

                          2. One of Ace’s investor clients has entered a long six-month forward transaction
                             with Ace on 100 shares of Xenaliya (XLYA), a non-dividend-paying technolo-
                             gy stock. The stock’s spot price per share, S0, is €85, and the risk-free rate is a
                             constant 1% for all maturities. Ace has hedged the client transaction with a long
Practice Problems                                                                            147


    six-month XLYA futures contract at a price f0(T) of €85.42 and posted initial
    margin of €1,000. Three months after the forward and futures contracts are ini-
    tiated, XYLA announces a strategic partnership with a major global technology
    firm, and its spot share price jumps €15 on the day’s trading to close at €123.
    Which of the following statements best characterizes the impact of the day’s trad-
    ing on the MTM value of the forward versus the futures contract?
    A. Ace’s client realizes an MTM gain of approximately €1,500 (= €15 × 100) on
       its margin account, which Ace must deposit at the end of the day to cover
       its margin call.

    B. Ace’s client benefits from an MTM unrealized gain on its forward contract
       with Ace, and Ace has a corresponding MTM gain of approximately €1,500
       (= €15 × 100) deposited in its margin account by the exchange.

    C. Because Ace has entered a hedge of its client’s long forward position on
       XLYA by executing a futures contract with otherwise identical terms,
       the two contract MTM values exactly offset one another and no cash is
       exchanged on either transaction.

3. Identify which of the following corresponds to which description.

1. Long interest rate futures position         A. Results in a gain when MRR settles above
                                               the initial forward commitment rate at
                                               maturity
2. Pay fixed (receive floating) FRA contract   B. Results in a loss when MRR settles above
                                               the initial forward commitment rate at
                                               maturity
3. Receive fixed (pay floating) FRA contract   C. Has a forward commitment price that will
                                               increase as short-term interest rates fall


4. Ace’s investor clients usually use OTC forward transactions that Ace must clear
   with a central counterparty. Which of the following statements related to the
   impact on Ace from clearing these positions is most accurate?
    A. If Ace’s counterparties enter long forward contracts whose prices are pos-
       itively correlated with interest rates, Ace will have to post more collateral
       to central counterparties than for otherwise similar futures contracts, since
       rising prices will lead to counterparty MTM gains reinvested at higher rates.

    B. If Ace’s counterparties enter short forward contracts whose prices are
       negatively correlated with interest rates, Ace will have to post less collateral
       to central counterparties than for otherwise similar futures contracts, since
       falling prices will lead to counterparty MTM gains reinvested at higher
       rates.

    C. Since Ace is required to post collateral (cash or highly liquid securi-
       ties) to the central counterparty to clear its client forward transactions,
       Ace will face similar margining requirements to those of standardized
       exchange-traded futures markets.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. A is correct. The CTA will face a margin call if the copper contract price falls
                             by more than $4,000, or $0.16 (= $4,000/25,000) per pound. We may solve for
                             the price at which the CTA receives a margin call by first solving for the initial
                             futures contract price, f0(T), at contract inception as follows:
                             f0(T) = [S0 + PV0(C)] (1 + r)T.
                             Solve for PV0(C) per pound as follows:
                             PV0(C) = $9.98 (= $10[1.01875–(1/12)]).
                             Substitute PV0(C) = $9.98 into Equation 4 to solve for f0(T):
                             f0(T) = [($4.25 × 25,000) + $9.98](1.01875 -(1/12))

                             f0(T) = $106,425 per contract (≈ $4.257 per pound).
                             So, $106,425 − $4,000 = $102,425 per contract, and $4.257 − $0.16 = $4.10 per
                             pound.
                             B is incorrect as it assumes there is no maintenance margin, and while C may be
                             true under some circumstances, the change in A is immediate (occurs at trade
                             inception).

                          2. B is correct. The long investor client forward position with Ace benefits from
                             an MTM gain on its forward contract with Ace, but no cash is exchanged until
                             maturity. Ace receives a deposit in its futures margin account equal to the daily
                             MTM futures contract gain, which if spot and futures prices change by approxi-
                             mately the same amount will be equal to €1,500 (€15 × 100).

                          3. 1. C is correct. The futures contract price changes daily based upon a (yield −
                             100) quoting convention, so its price will increase as yields fall and vice versa. The
                             fixed rate on an FRA does not change for the life of the contract.
                             2. A is correct. An FRA fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver) will realize a gain
                             on the contract upon settlement (equal to the present value of the difference be-
                             tween the fixed rate and MRR multiplied by the contract notional over the speci-
                             fied interest period) if MRR settles above the initial fixed rate on the contract.
                             3. B is correct. If the MRR settles above the initial forward commitment rate at
                             maturity, the FRA fixed-rate payer has an MTM loss on the contract.

                          4. C is correct. Mandatory central clearing requirements impose margin re-
                             quirements on financial intermediaries similar to those of standardized
                             exchange-traded futures markets, who often pass these costs and/or require-
                             ments on to their clients. Answers A and B are incorrect, as the MTM gains on
                             the forward contracts are not realized until maturity.

INTRODUCTION
Swap contracts were introduced earlier as a firm commitment to exchange a series of
                                                                                             1
cash flows in the future, with interest rate swaps where fixed cash flows are exchanged
for floating payments being the most common type. Subsequent lessons addressed
the pricing and valuation of forward and futures contracts across the term structure,
which form the building blocks for swap contracts.
    In this lesson, we will explore how swap contracts are related to these other forward
commitment types. While financial intermediaries often use forward rate agreements
or short-term interest rate futures contracts to manage interest rate exposure, issuers
and investors usually prefer swap contracts, since they better match rate-sensitive
assets and liabilities with periodic cash flows, such as fixed-coupon bonds, variable-rate
loans, or known future commitments. It is important for these market participants
not only to be able to match expected future cash flows using swaps but also to ensure
that their change in value is consistent with existing or desired underlying exposures.
The following lessons compare swap contracts with forward contracts and contrast
the value and price of swaps.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   A swap contract is an agreement between two counterparties
           to exchange a series of future cash flows, whereas a forward
           contract is a single exchange of value at a later date.

                              ■   Interest rate swaps are similar to forwards in that both contracts are
                                  firm commitments with symmetric payoff profiles and no cash is
                                  exchanged at inception, but they differ in that the fixed swap rate is
                                  constant, whereas a series of forward contracts has different forward
                                  rates at each maturity.
                              ■   A swap is priced by solving for the par swap rate, a fixed rate that sets
                                  the present value of all future expected floating cash flows equal to the
                                  present value of all future fixed cash flows.
                              ■   The value of a swap at inception is zero (ignoring transaction and
                                  counterparty credit costs). On any settlement date, the value of a
                                  swap equals the current settlement value plus the present value of all
                                  remaining future swap settlements.
                              ■   A swap contract’s value changes as time passes and interest rates
                                  change. For example, a rise in expected forward rates increases the
                                  present value of floating payments, causing a mark-to-market (MTM)
                                  gain for the fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver) and an MTM loss
                                  for the fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer).



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. Identify which of the following characteristics matches which forward com-
                              mitment contract.
                                                                      ​




                            1. Involves periodic settlements based   A. Both an interest rate swap and a series
                            on the difference between a fixed        of forward rate agreements
                            rate established for each period and
                            market reference rate (MRR)
                            2. Has a symmetric payoff profile and    B. A series of forward rate agreements
                            a value of zero to both counterparties   (FRAs)
                            at inception
                            3. Involves periodic settlements based   C. Interest rate swap
                            on the difference between a constant
                            fixed rate and the MRR
                                                                      ​




                             Solution:

                              1. B is correct. A series of FRAs involves periodic settlements based on
                                 the difference between a fixed rate established for each period and the
                                 MRR.
                              2. A is correct. Both an interest rate swap and a series of forward rate
                                 agreements have a symmetric payoff profile and a value of zero to both
                                 counterparties at inception.
                              3. C is correct. An interest rate swap involves periodic settlements based
                                 on the difference between a constant fixed rate and the MRR.

                           2. Which of the following transactions would allow a fixed-income portfolio
                              manager to gain from falling interest rates?
                              A. Buy a floating-rate bond
                              B. Enter into a receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate swap
Introduction                                                                            151


      C. Enter into a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap
     Solution:
     B is correct. A fixed-income portfolio manager seeking to gain from falling
     interest rates may consider entering a receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate
     swap rather than purchasing bonds. The fixed-rate payments become more
     valuable as interest rates decline A is incorrect as the floating-rate bond in-
     terest rate payments decline as interest rates decline, thus the bond does not
     increase in value. C is incorrect as the fixed interest rate payments become
     more costly as interest rates decline.

  3. Which of the following statements provides a correct description of a pay-
     fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap position?
      A. Long a floating-rate note priced at the MRR and short a fixed-rate
         bond with a coupon equal to the fixed swap rate
      B. Long a fixed-rate bond with a coupon equal to the fixed swap rate and
         short a floating-rate note priced at the MRR
      C. Long a floating-rate note priced at the MRR
     Solution:
     A is correct. An interest rate swap is economically equivalent to a long
     and short position in underlying debt securities. In the case of a pay-fixed,
     receive-floating swap, the cash flow received reflects the long position.
     In this case, the party receives floating payments, so this is like buying a
     floating-rate note. The pay-fixed portion of the swap is like selling a fixed-
     rate bond and paying fixed coupons to the bond buyer. B is incorrect as
     this response is economically equivalent to entering into a receive-fixed,
     pay-floating swap. C is incorrect because the response does not reflect the
     short position.

  4. 4. An investor enters into a 10-year, pay-fixed EUR100 million swap at a rate
     of 1.12% versus six-month EUR MRR. Assume six-month EUR MRR sets
     today at 0.25%. Which of the following is closest to the correct calculation of
     the periodic settlement value of the swap from the investor’s perspective in
     six months’ time?
      A. EUR870,000
      B. –EUR870,000
      C. –EUR435,000
     Solution:
     C is correct. From the investor’s (fixed-rate payer’s) perspective, the periodic
     settlement value of the swap is equal to
     Periodic settlement value = (MRR – sN) × Notional amount × Period
     = –EUR435,000 = (0.25% – 1.12%) × EUR100 million × 0.5 years.
     Since EUR MRR has set below the fixed swap rate, the fixed-rate payer must
     make a net payment to the fixed-rate receiver at the end of the interest
     period. Both A and B responses omit the period of the swap (0.5 years) so
     are incorrect. A is also incorrect because the reversed sign on the answer
     would properly reflect the counterparty’s periodic settlement value, not the
     investor’s.

              2           SWAPS VS. FORWARDS

                                        describe how swap contracts are similar to but different from a series
                                        of forward contracts

                          A swap contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange a series of future
                          cash flows, while a forward contract is an agreement for a single exchange of value
                          at a later date. Although this lesson focuses on interest rate swaps, similar principles
                          apply to other underlying variables where a series of cash flows are exchanged on a
                          future date.
                              An earlier lesson showed how implied forward rates may be derived from spot
                          rates. An implied forward rate for a given period in the future is equivalent to the
                          forward rate agreement (FRA) fixed rate for that same period for which no riskless
                          profit opportunities exist. The single cash flow of an FRA is similar to a single-period
                          swap, as shown in Exhibit 1.



                            Exhibit 1: Swap and FRA Payoff Profile

                                                                       Fixed-Rate
                                                                          Payer




                                                             MRR ×               Fixed-Rate
                                                         Notional ×              × Notional
                                                            Period               × Period




                                                                      Floating-Rate
                                                                          Payer




                          In each case, the net difference between a fixed rate agreed on at inception and an
                          MRR set in the future is used as the basis for determining cash settlement on a given
                          notional principal over a specific time period. For example, a fixed-rate payer on a
                          swap or FRA will realize a gain if the MRR sets at a rate higher than the agreed-on
                          fixed rate and will receive a net payment from the floating-rate payer. However, as we
                          saw in an earlier lesson, the FRA has a single settlement, which occurs at the beginning
                          of an interest period, while a standard swap has periodic settlements, which occur at
                          the end of each respective period.
                              Other similarities between interest rate forwards and swaps include the symmetric
                          payoff profile and the fact that no cash flow is exchanged upfront. Both interest rate
                          forward and swap contracts involve counterparty credit exposure.
                              Since interest rates are characterized by a term structure, different FRA fixed rates
                          usually exist for different times to maturity. In contrast, a standard interest rate swap
                          has a constant fixed rate over its life, which includes multiple periods. This relationship
                          is shown visually in Exhibit 2 and numerically in Example 1, which extends an earlier
                          spot and forward rate example.

  We solve for the implied forward rate (IFRA,B–A), the break-even reinvestment
  rate for a period starting in the future (at t = A) between short-dated (zA) and
  longer-dated (zB) zero rate using the following formula:
         (1 + zA)A × (1 + IFRA,B–A)B–A = (1 + zB)B.                                               (1)
  The respective spot rate at time t = 0 (IFR0,1) and the implied forward rates in
  one year (IFR1,1) and in two years (IFR2,1) are as follows:

                             IFR0,1 = 2.3960% = (1.023960) – 1.

                             IFR1,1 = 4.4536% = (1.034197)2/(1.02396) – 1.

                             IFR2,1 = 5.1719% = (1.040005)3/(1.034197)2 – 1.
                          One way to create a forward commitment for multiple periods with an initial
                          value of zero would be to use a series of forward rate agreements, exchanging
                          cash flows based on the respective implied forward rate (i.e., the FRA fixed
                          rate) for each period. However, the fixed rate would vary for each period based
                          on the term structure of interest rates. Instead, a standard interest rate swap
                          is characterized by a constant fixed rate over multiple periods. These rates are
                          shown for both alternatives below.

                              The method used to solve for a swap rate was introduced in an earlier
                          fixed-income lesson. The par rate (PMT) was shown to be the fixed rate at which
                          a fixed-coupon bond has a price equal to par (or 100) using a sequence of zero
                          rates (zi for period i) as market discount factors, as follows:
                                                                             PMT + 100
                             	​100 = _
                                     ​ PMT 1 ​+ _     ​ PMT ​+ ⋯ + _  ​                 ​.​	                                 (2)

                          A standard interest rate swap represents an exchange of fixed payments (with
                          no final principal payment) at a constant rate for a series of floating-rate cash
                          flows expected to equal the respective implied forward rates at time t = 0. We
                          must therefore modify the par bond rate calculation in Equation 2 to solve for
                          PMT as a par swap rate.

       0.111017 = 2.800545 × s3.

       s3 = 3.9641%.

    The three-year swap rate of 3.9641% may be interpreted as a multiperiod breakeven
rate at which an investor would be indifferent to
   ■    paying the fixed swap rate and receiving the respective forward rates or
   ■    receiving the fixed swap rate and paying the respective forward rates.
    For this reason, we may think of the fixed swap rate as an internal rate of return
on the implied forward rates through the maturity of the swap as of t = 0. Exhibit 3
also demonstrates that while the combined value of the equivalent forward contracts
is zero at time t = 0, some individual forward exchanges may have a positive present
value and some will have a negative present value. For example, a fixed-rate receiver
(floating-rate payer) on the swap in Example 1 would expect the following cash flow
in one year’s time:
   ■    Receive the fixed swap rate (s3) of 3.9641%.
   ■    Pay the initial floating rate (IFR0,1) of 2.396%.

                              Derivative end users, such as issuers and investors, tend to use swaps more often
                          than individual interest rate forward contracts for a number of reasons. For exam-
                          ple, the ability to match cash flows of underlying assets or liabilities allows issuers to
                          transform their exposure profile as in Example 2.

                             Recall from an earlier lesson that Esterr Inc. has a CAD250 million floating-rate
                             term loan at three-month Canadian MRR plus 150 basis points with three and a
                             half years to maturity paid quarterly. Esterr enters into a CAD250 million inter-
                             est rate swap contract to pay a fixed quarterly swap rate of 2.05% and receive a
                             three-month floating MRR on a notional principal of CAD250 million based on
                             payment dates that match the term loan. The combined loan and swap exposure
                             may be shown as follows:

                                                                  Loan market

                                                                  intermediary

                                 Under the swap arrangement, Esterr can fix its interest expense for the
                             term loan and avoids the administrative burden of multiple forward contracts
                             at different forward rates. Consider the following cash flow scenarios on the
                             interest rate swap and term loan (assuming each interest period is 0.25 year):

                             Scenario 1:
                             CAD MRR sets at 3.75%. As the fixed-rate payer, Esterr
                                  ■   pays the fixed swap rate of 2.05% and receives CAD MRR of 3.75%,
                                  ■   receives a net swap payment of 1.70% for the quarter, and
                                  ■   makes a term loan payment of 5.25% (= 3.75% + 1.50%).
                                  Esterr’s interest expense is 3.55% (= 5.25% paid – 1.70% received).

                             Scenario 2:
                             CAD MRR sets at 1.25%. As the fixed-rate payer, Esterr
                                  ■   pays the fixed swap rate of 2.05% and receives CAD MRR of 1.25%,
                                  ■   pays a net swap payment of 0.80% for the quarter, and
Swaps vs. Forwards                                                                          157


       ■   makes a term loan payment of 2.75% (= 1.25% + 1.50%).
       Esterr’s interest expense is 3.55% (= 2.75% paid + 0.80% paid).
       Regardless of where CAD MRR sets each period, Esterr’s interest expense for
   each quarterly interest period is approximately CAD2,218,750 (= 3.55%, [equal
   to the 2.05% swap rate + 1.50% loan spread] × CAD250 million × 0.25 year).

    As a fixed-income instrument with periodic fixed cash flows through maturity, an
interest rate swap should be expected to have risk and return features similar to those
of a fixed-coupon bond of a similar maturity. This feature makes interest rate swaps
a more attractive alternative to forward rate agreements for investors in managing
fixed-income exposures as well. Consider the following comparison of a cash bond
position to paying or receiving a fixed swap rate:

    While the next lesson will explore the value and price of interest rate swaps in
greater detail, Exhibit 4 demonstrates the similarity between a long (short) bond posi-
tion and a receive (pay) fixed interest rate swap. Given their greater liquidity than and
similar benchmark exposure profile to individual bond positions, active fixed-income
portfolio managers often use swaps rather than underlying securities to adjust their
interest rate exposure. For example, if interest rates are expected to fall, a portfolio
manager may choose to receive fixed on a swap rather than purchase underlying bonds
to realize a gain in a lower rate environment.

                              As mentioned earlier, FRAs are primarily used by financial intermediaries to man-
                          age their rate-sensitive positions on a period-by-period basis. Issuers and investors
                          typically opt for the greater efficiency of interest rate swaps to manage their interest
                          rate exposures. As we will see in later lessons, the greater liquidity of interest rate
                          swaps has also led to their use both as a bond pricing benchmark and an underlying
                          variable for other derivative instruments.

                            Interest Rate Swaps vs. Forward Contracts

                            1. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: A fixed-rate payer on a
                               swap or FRA will realize a(n) ______ if the MRR sets at a rate higher than
                               the agreed-on fixed rate and will ______ a net payment ______ the float-
                               ing-rate payer.
                               Solution:
                               A fixed-rate payer on a swap or FRA will realize a gain if the MRR sets at a
                               rate higher than the agreed-on fixed rate and will receive a net payment from
                               the floating-rate payer.

                            2. Identify which of the following characteristics matches which forward com-
                               mitment contract.
                                                                         ​




                              1. The price of this contract is the implied forward     A. Interest rate swap
                              rate, or the breakeven reinvestment rate, for a period

                              exchanges is equal to zero                               forward contract
                                                                         ​




                               Solution:

                                1. B is correct. The breakeven reinvestment rate, or implied forward rate,
                                   is the no-arbitrage FRA fixed rate.
                                2. C is correct. Both an interest rate swap and a forward rate agreement
                                   involve counterparty credit risk.
                                3. A is correct. An interest rate swap has a constant fixed rate for which
                                   the present value of fixed versus floating cash flow exchanges equals
                                   zero.

  3. Identify which of the following benefits of using swaps over forwards are
     most applicable to which derivative end users.
                                                ​




    1. Swaps allow these end users to match the peri-          A. Both issuers and
    odic cash flows of a specific balance sheet liability to   investors
    transform their interest rate exposure profile.
    2. Swaps enable these end users to actively adjust         B. Issuers
    their interest rate exposure profile without buying or
    selling underlying securities
    3. Swaps involving a series of cash flows enable           C. Investors
    these end users to avoid the administrative burden
    of entering into and managing multiple forward
    contracts.
                                                ​




     Solution:

      1. B is correct. Swaps allow issuers to match the periodic cash flows of a
         specific balance sheet liability to transform their interest rate exposure
         profile, as shown in Example 2.
      2. C is correct. Swaps enable investors to actively adjust their interest
         rate exposure profile without buying or selling underlying securities.
      3. A is correct. Both issuers and investors benefit from a reduced admin-
         istrative burden of entering one interest rate swap for a series of cash
         flows rather than multiple individual forward contracts.

  4. Identify the following statement as true or false, and justify your response:
     The market reference rate (MRR) is the internal rate of return on the implied
     forward rates over the life of an interest rate swap.
     Solution:
     False. The fixed swap rate is the internal rate of return on the implied for-
     ward rates over the life of an interest rate swap.

  5. Explain how an active fixed-income portfolio manager might use an interest
     rate swap rather than underlying bonds to realize a gain in a lower–interest
     rate environment, and justify your response.
     Solution:
     A manager may choose to receive fixed, pay floating on an interest rate
     swap, with the fixed cash flow stream being similar to owning a fixed-cou-
     pon bond. If interest rates are expected to fall, the manager will realize an
     MTM gain in a lower-rate environment.




SWAP VALUES AND PRICES
                                                                                         3
               contrast the value and price of swaps

In the prior lesson, we showed a swap price (or par swap rate) to be a periodic fixed
rate that equates the present value of all future expected floating cash flows to the
present value of fixed cash flows. The swap rate (sN for N periods) is equivalent to a
160   Learning Module 7                                      Pricing and Valuation of Interest Rates and Other Swaps


                          forward rate, F0(T), that satisfies the no-arbitrage condition. Similar to other forwards,
                          the initial contract value (ignoring transaction and counterparty credit costs) is zero
                          (V0(T) = 0).
                              In contrast to other forward commitments, which involve a single settlement at
                          maturity, a swap contract involves a series of periodic settlements with a final settle-
                          ment at contract maturity. Recall from an earlier lesson that the value of a forward
                          contract at maturity from the long forward (or forward buyer’s) perspective is V T(T)
                          = ST – F0(T), where ST is the spot price at maturity and F0(T) is the forward price.
                          For a swap with periodic exchanges, the current MRR is the “spot” price and the fixed
                          swap rate, sN, is the forward price. Restating this result for the fixed-rate payer on a
                          swap, the periodic settlement value is
                             Periodic settlement value = (MRR – sN) × Notional amount × Period.               (4)
                          The value of a swap on any settlement date equals the current settlement value in
                          Equation 4 plus the present value of all remaining future swap settlements. Although
                          swap market conventions vary, for purposes of this lesson we will assume the MRR
                          sets at the beginning of each interest period, with the same periodicity and day count
                          convention as the swap rate. The fixed versus floating difference is exchanged at the
                          end of each period.

                          EXAMPLE 3

                             Esterr Inc. Swap Value and Price
                             Esterr entered a 3.5-year CAD250 million interest rate swap contract under
                             which it pays a fixed quarterly swap rate of 2.05% and receives three-month
                             CAD MRR. The fixed swap price of 2.05% paid by Esterr remains constant over
                             the life of the contract. While the first three-month CAD MRR is known at t =
                             0, the remaining 13 MRR settings are unknown but are expected to equal the
                             respective implied forward rates (IFRs) for each period through maturity. A prior
                             lesson showed how IFRs are derived from zero rates, which were then used to
                             solve for the fixed swap rate by setting the present value of fixed payments equal
                             to the present value of floating payments.
                                 The value of Esterr’s swap contract will change as time passes and interest
                             rates change. We first consider the passage of time with no change to expected
                             interest rates. That is, the MRR sets each period based on the implied forward
                             rates at trade inception. Assume the following implied forward rates apply to
                             Esterr’s swap at t = 0:
                                                                         ​

  Based on these forward rates, Esterr expects to make a net swap payment each
  quarter through the seventh period—since (MRR – sN) = (1.94% – 2.05%)
  < 0—and receive a net quarterly swap payment starting in the eighth period,
  where (MRR – sN) = (2.18% – 2.05%) > 0. Using Equation 1, consider the peri-
  odic settlement values for the first two periods from Esterr’s perspective as the
  fixed-rate payer:
         ■     Period 1: –CAD968,750 = (0.5% – 2.05%) × CAD250 million × 0.25.
         ■     Period 2: –CAD818,750 = (0.74% – 2.05%) × CAD250 million × 0.25.
      What is the swap MTM value from Esterr’s perspective immediately after
  the second periodic settlement if forward rates remain unchanged? Note that
  the swap price (the fixed swap rate of 2.05%) was set at inception to equate the
  present value of fixed versus floating payments.

                                Σ PV(Floating payments received) > Σ PV(Fixed payments paid).
                             Note that this result depends on the relative level of IFRs and shape of the for-
                             ward curve, which in this case is upward sloping.
                                 If we instead consider interest rate changes only, from Esterr’s perspective
                             as the fixed-rate payer (and floating-rate receiver), we can show the conditions
                             under which Esterr has a swap MTM gain or loss:
                                 ■   Esterr realizes an MTM gain on the swap as the fixed-rate payer if
                                Σ PV(Floating payments received) > Σ PV(Fixed payments paid).

                                 ■   Esterr realizes an MTM loss on the swap as the fixed-rate payer if

                                Σ PV(Floating payments received) < Σ PV(Fixed payments paid).
                                 A rise in the expected forward rates after inception will increase the present
                             value of floating payments, while the fixed swap rate will remain the same. We
                             show the effect of an immediate change in interest rates following trade inception
                             in the following diagram:

                                                             Quarterly period
                                 The new forward curve in this diagram is composed of higher IFRs. If we
                             were to now solve for a fixed swap rate using these higher IFRs by setting floating
                             and fixed cash flows equal to one another, the new swap rate would be above the
                             original swap rate. However, since Esterr has locked in future fixed payments at
                             the lower original swap rate while receiving higher expected future MRRs, the
                             swap has a positive MTM value to Esterr.

                              Another interpretation of an interest rate swap is that the fixed-rate payer
                          (floating-rate receiver) is long a floating-rate note (FRN) priced at the MRR and short a
                          fixed-rate bond with a coupon equal to the fixed swap rate. Note that the combination
                          of long and short bond positions causes both the purchase and sale prices of the two
                          bonds at inception and the return of principal at maturity cancel one another out, and
                          only the fixed versus variable coupon payments remain. The following example shows
                          how the change in an interest rate swap’s value is similar to that of a fixed-income
                          security using an earlier investor swap example.

                          EXAMPLE 4

                             Fyleton Investments
                             Fyleton Investments entered a five-year, receive-fixed GBP200 million interest
                             rate swap in an example from an earlier lesson to increase the duration of its
                             fixed-income portfolio. Assume in this case that Fyleton receives a fixed swap
Swap Values and Prices                                                                      163


   rate of 2.38% on a semiannual basis versus six-month GBP MRR. Further assume
   that initial six-month GBP MRR sets at 0.71% and, as in the case of Esterr, the
   MRR forward curve is upward sloping. How will the value of Fyleton’s swap
   change as time passes and interest rates change?
       First, consider the passage of time with no rate changes. The first-period
   swap settlement value (in six months) from Fyleton’s perspective as the fixed-
   rate receiver is
      GBP1,670,000 = (2.38% – 0.71%) × GBP200 million × 0.5.
   What is the MTM value from Fyleton’s perspective immediately following the
   first settlement if implied forward rates remain the same as at trade inception?
       As the fixed-rate receiver, Fyleton will realize an MTM loss on the swap, since
      Σ PV(Floating payments paid) > Σ PV(Fixed payments received).
   Second, consider a change in forward rates. A decline in expected forward rates
   immediately following trade inception will reduce the present value of floating
   payments, while the fixed swap rate will remain the same. Fyleton will realize
   an MTM gain as the fixed-rate receiver, since
      Σ PV(Fixed payments received) > Σ PV(Floating payments paid).
   This MTM gain is shown by the different size of the shaded areas under the
   original swap rate using the new forward curve in the following diagram.

      2.00%
                                                                 New swap rate

    Note the similarity between the receive-fixed swap exposure profile and that of a
long cash fixed-rate bond position. In the first instance, we would expect a fixed-rate
par bond to be priced at a discount as time passes if rates rise as per an upward-sloping
forward curve, while an FRN priced at the MRR would remain at par. In the second
instance, a decline in implied forward rates (or downward shift in the forward curve)
would cause a fixed-rate par bond to be priced at a premium, while the FRN price
would not change. We will explore how term structure and yield curve changes affect
swap values and bond prices in greater detail later in the curriculum.

                          QUESTION SET

                           Swap Prices and Values

                           1. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: A rise in the expected
                              forward rates after inception will ______ the present value of floating pay-
                              ments, causing a fixed-rate receiver to realize a(n) ______ in MTM value on
                              the swap contract.
                             Solution:
                             A rise in the expected forward rates after inception will increase the present
                             value of floating payments, causing a fixed-rate receiver to realize a decline
                             in MTM value on the swap contract.

                           2. Identify the following statement as true or false, and justify your response:
                              The fixed rate on an interest rate swap is priced such that the present value
                              of the floating payments (based on respective implied forward rates for each
                              period) is equal to the present value of the fixed payments at t = 0.
                             Solution:
                             This statement is true. The fixed rate on an interest rate swap may be solved
                             by setting the present value of floating payments equal to the present value
                             of fixed payments. We use zero rates to derive implied forward rates, or
                             breakeven reinvestment rates, between a shorter and a longer zero rate.
                             These IFRs represent the respective floating rates that are expected to apply
                             for each future period at time t = 0.

                           3. Identify which of the following statements is associated with which position
                              in an interest rate swap contract.
                                                                       ​

                            future cash flows on a swap contract
                            at inception
                            2. Realizes an MTM gain on a swap         B. Fixed-rate receiver (Floating-rate payer)
                            contract if the expected future
                            floating-rate payments increase
                            3. An investor may increase portfolio     C. Neither a fixed-rate payer nor a
                            duration by entering this position in a   fixed-rate receiver
                            swap contract
                                                                       ​




                             Solution:

                              1. C is correct. A swap contract establishes a set of certain fixed future
                                 cash flows that are exchanged for a set of expected (uncertain) floating
                                 future cash flows. Therefore, neither a fixed-rate payer nor a fixed-rate
                                 receiver knows the net future cash flows of a swap at inception.
                              2. A is correct. A fixed-rate payer realizes an MTM gain on a swap con-
                                 tract if the expected future floating-rate payments increase.
                              3. B is correct. A fixed-rate receiver may increase portfolio duration by
                                 entering this position on a swap, because receiving fixed is similar to a
                                 long bond position.
Swap Values and Prices                                                                    165


  4. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: The value of a swap on
     any settlement date equals the ______ settlement value plus the present
     value of all remaining ______ swap settlements.
     Solution:
     The value of a swap on any settlement date equals the current settlement
     value plus the present value of all remaining future swap settlements.

  5. Describe how an investor may use an interest rate swap to reduce the dura-
     tion of a fixed-income portfolio, and justify your response.
     Solution:
     A pay-fixed swap is similar to a short bond position that reduces duration,
     because the fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver) is effectively long a float-
     ing-rate note priced at the MRR and short a fixed-rate bond with a coupon
     equal to the fixed swap rate.

                             PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                          The following information relates to questions
                          1-6
                              Ace Limited is a financial intermediary that is active in forward and swap mar-
                              kets with its issuer and investor clients. You have been asked to consult on a
                              number of client situations to determine the best course of action.

                          1. Identify which of the following statements is associated with which Ace counter-
                             party swap position.

                          1. Ace’s counterparty with this swap posi-    A. A receive-fixed interest rate swap
                          tion will realize an MTM gain if implied
                          forward rates rise.
                          2. Ace’s counterparty with this swap posi-    B. A pay-fixed interest rate swap
                          tion will make a net payment if the initial
                          market reference rate sets above the fixed
                          swap rate.
                          3. Ace’s counterparty with this position      C. Both a receive-fixed and a pay-fixed interest
                          will face an initial swap contract value      rate swap
                          (ignoring transaction and counterparty
                          credit costs) of zero.


                          2. Ace’s client is an asset manager with a significant portion of its fixed-rate bond
                             investment portfolio maturing soon. Ace intends to reinvest the proceeds in
                             five-year bond maturities. Which of the following describes the best course of
                             action in the derivatives market for Ace’s client to address its bond reinvestment
                             risk?
                              A. Ace’s client should consider receiving fixed on a cash-settled five-year
                                 forward-starting swap that starts and settles in three months in order to
                                 best address its bond reinvestment risk.

                              B. Ace’s client should consider paying fixed on a cash-settled five-year
                                 forward-starting swap starting in three months in order to best address its
                                 bond reinvestment risk.

                              C. Ace’s client should consider entering a series of forward rate agreements
                                 (FRAs) from today until five years from now under which it pays a fixed rate
                                 and receives a floating rate each period ending in five years to address its
                                 bond reinvestment risk.

                          3. Ace enters a 10-year GBP interest rate swap with a client in which Ace receives
                             an initial six-month GBP MRR of 1.75% and pays a fixed GBP swap rate of 3.10%
                             for the first semiannual period. Which of the following statements best describes
                             the value of the swap from Ace’s perspective three months after the inception of
                             the trade?
                              A. Ace has an MTM loss on the swap, because it owes a net settlement pay-
                                 ment to its counterparty equal to 1.35% multiplied by the notional and
                                 period.
Practice Problems                                                                       167


    B. Ace has an MTM gain on the swap, because once it makes the first known
       net payment to its counterparty, the remainder of the future net fixed
       versus floating cash flows must have a positive present value from Ace’s
       perspective.

    C. While the present value of fixed and future cash flows was set to zero by
       solving for the swap rate at inception, we do not have enough information to
       determine whether the swap currently has a positive or negative value from
       Ace’s perspective following inception.

4. Ace enters a 10-year GBP interest rate swap with a client in which Ace receives
   an initial six-month GBP MRR of 1.75% and pays a fixed GBP swap rate of 3.10%
   for the first semiannual period. Six months later, Ace and its counterparty settle
   the first swap payment, and no change has occurred in terms of future interest
   rate expectations. Which of the following statements best describes the value of
   the swap from Ace’s perspective?
    A. Ace has an MTM gain on the swap, because once it makes the first known
       net payment to its counterparty, the remainder of the future net fixed
       versus floating cash flows must have a positive present value from Ace’s
       perspective.

    B. Ace has an MTM loss on the swap, because once it receives the first known
       payment from its counterparty, the remainder of the future net fixed
       versus floating cash flows must have a negative present value from Ace’s
       perspective.

    C. While the present value of fixed and future cash flows was set to zero by
       solving for the swap rate at inception, we do not have enough information to
       determine whether the swap currently has a positive or negative value from
       Ace’s perspective following inception.

5. At time t = 0, Ace observes the following zero rates over three periods:

Periods                                              Zero Rates

1                                                     2.2727%
2                                                     3.0323%
3                                                     3.6355%

    Which of the following best describes how Ace arrives at a three-period par swap
    rate (s3)?
    A. Since the par swap rate represents the fixed rate at which the present value
       of fixed and future cash flows equal one another, we discount each zero rate
       back to the present using zero rates and solve for s3 to get 2.961%.

    B. Since the par swap rate represents the fixed rate at which the present value
       of fixed and future cash flows equal one another, we first solve for the
       implied forward rate per period using zero rates, then discount each implied
       forward rate back to the present using zero rates, and solve for s3 to get
       3.605%.

                             C. Since the par swap rate represents the fixed rate at which the present value
                                of fixed and future cash flows equal one another, we first solve for the
                                implied forward rate per period using zero rates, then discount each zero
                                rate back to the present using implied forward rates, and solve for s3 to get
                                3.009%.

                          6. Ace’s issuer client has swapped its outstanding fixed-rate debt to floating to
                             match asset portfolio cash flows that generate an MRR-based return. Which of
                             the following statements best describes how Ace’s MTM credit exposure to the
                             issuer changes if interest rates rise immediately following trade inception?
                             A. Since the client receives fixed and pays floating swap, it faces an MTM
                                loss on the transaction as rates rise, increasing Ace’s MTM exposure to the
                                client.

                             B. Since the client receives fixed and pays floating swap, it faces an MTM gain
                                on the transaction as rates rise, decreasing Ace’s MTM exposure to the
                                client.

                             C. Since the swap’s value is equal to the current settlement plus future
                                expected settlement amounts, we do not have enough information to deter-
                                mine whether Ace’s MTM exposure to the client increases or decreases.
Solutions                                                                                                 169




   SOLUTIONS
1. 1. B is correct. A pay-fixed swap counterparty will realize an MTM gain if implied
   forward rates rise.
   2. A is correct. A receive-fixed swap counterparty will make a net payment if the
   initial market reference rate sets above the fixed swap rate.
   3. C is correct. Both a receive-fixed and a pay-fixed swap counterparty will face
   an initial swap contract value (ignoring transaction and counterparty credit
   costs) of zero.

2. A is correct. Ace’s client should consider receiving fixed on a five-year swap. A
   receive-fixed swap has a risk and return profile similar to that of a long fixed-rate
   bond position. Ace’s client would therefore expect to have a similar MTM gain or
   loss on the swap position as if it had purchased a five-year bond at inception.

3. C is correct. At time t = 0, the present value of fixed and future cash flows was set
   to zero by solving for the swap rate at inception. Although the current settlement
   value is known, we cannot determine whether the swap has a positive or negative
   value from Ace’s perspective three months later without further information—
   specifically, the current level of future forward rates.

4. A is correct. Ace makes the first net payment because the fixed-rate payment
   is greater than the floating rate received. Given no change in forward interest
   rates, this implies that the remaining net cash flows must have positive present
   value to Ace. B is incorrect as this response states the opposite compared to the
   prior response. C is incorrect because we have information about forward rate
   expectations.

5. B is correct. Since the expected floating cash flows on the swap are the implied
   forward rates, we first use zero rates to solve for IFRs using Equation 1:
   (1 + zA)A × (1 + IFRA,B–A)B–A = (1 + zB)B.
   We may solve for these rates as IFR0,1 = 2.2727%, IFR1,1 = 3.7975%, and IFR2,1 =
   4.8525%. We then substitute the respective IFRs discounted by zero rates into the
   following equation to solve for s3:

   _  IF ​R0,
           ​ 1​ IF ​R1,     ​ 1​ _      IF ​R2,

                                                                                        ​            ​.

                          fixed-rate settlements, resulting in an MTM loss for the client and an increase in
                          Ace’s MTM exposure.

INTRODUCTION
Option contracts are contingent claims in which one of the counterparties determines
                                                                                            1
whether and when a trade will settle. Unlike a forward commitment with a value of zero
to both counterparties at inception, an option buyer pays a premium to the seller for
the right to transact the underlying in the future at a pre-agreed price. The contingent
nature of options affects their price as well as their value over time.
    In the first lesson, we explore three features unique to contingent claims related
to an option’s value versus the spot price of the underlying: the exercise, or intrinsic,
value; the relationship between an option’s spot price and its exercise price, referred
to as “moneyness”; and the time value. We then turn to how the arbitrage and repli-
cation concepts introduced earlier for forward commitments differ when applied to
contingent claims with an asymmetric payoff profile. Finally, we identify and describe
factors that determine the value of an option. These lessons focus on European options,
which can be exercised only at expiration.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   An option’s value comprises its exercise value and its time
           value. The exercise value is the option’s value if it were immedi-
           ately exercisable, while the time value captures the possibility that the
           passage of time and the variability of the underlying price will increase
           the profitability of exercise at maturity.
       ■   Option moneyness expresses the relationship between the underlying
           price and the exercise price. A put or call option is “at the money”
           when the underlying price equals the exercise price. An option is more
172   Learning Module 8                                                         Pricing and Valuation of Options


                                  likely to be exercised if it is “in the money”—with an underlying price
                                  above (for a call) or below (for a put) the exercise price—and less likely
                                  to be exercised if it is “out of the money.”
                              ■   Due to their asymmetric payoff profile, options are characterized
                                  by no-arbitrage price bounds. The lower bound is a function of the
                                  present value of the exercise price and the underlying price, while the
                                  upper bound is the underlying price for a call and the exercise price
                                  for a put.
                              ■   As in the case of forward commitments, the replication of option
                                  contracts uses a combination of long (for a call) or short (for a put)
                                  positions in an underlying asset and borrowing or lending cash. The
                                  replicating transaction for an option is based on a proportion of the
                                  underlying, which is closely associated with the moneyness of the
                                  option.
                              ■   The underlying price, the exercise price, the time to maturity, the risk-
                                  free rate, the volatility of the underlying price, and any income or cost
                                  associated with owning the underlying asset are key factors in deter-
                                  mining the value of an option.
                              ■   Changes in the volatility of the underlying price and the time to
                                  expiration will usually have the same directional effect on put and call
                                  option values. Changes to the exercise price, the risk-free rate, and any
                                  income or cost associated with owning the underlying asset have the
                                  opposite effect on call options versus put options.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. Which of the following statements correctly describes the lower bound of a
                              call option’s value?
                              A. The underlying’s price minus the present value of the option’s exercise
                                 price
                              B. The underlying’s price minus the option’s exercise price or zero,
                                 whichever is greater
                              C. The underlying’s price minus the present value of the option’s exercise
                                 price or zero, whichever is greater
                             Solution:
                             C is correct. The lower bound of a call price is the underlying’s price minus
                             the present value of its exercise price or zero, whichever is greater. A is
                             incorrect as the response omits the fact that the lower bound is zero if the
                             underlying’s price is less than the present value of the exercise price. B is
                             incorrect as it omits the present value term.
Introduction                                                                                     173


  2. Match the following statements about replication strategies with their asso-
     ciated derivative instrument(s):
                                                 ​




    1. At time t = 0, lend at the risk-free          A. Neither a call option nor a put option
    rate and sell the underlying at S0.              replication strategy
    2. The replication strategy is executed at B. A put option replication strategy
    inception and is settled at maturity with
    no adjustment over time.
    3. At time t = T, sell the underlying at         C. A call option replication strategy if
    ST and repay the loan of X.                      exercised
                                                 ​




     Solution:

      1. B is correct. At time t = 0, a put option replication strategy involves
         lending at the risk-free rate and selling the underlying at S0.
      2. A is correct. As both call and put options involve a non-linear payoff
         profile, their replication strategy requires adjustment over time as the
         likelihood of exercise changes.
      3. C is correct. A call option replication strategy if exercised involves
         repaying the loan of X and selling the underlying at ST at time t = T.

  3. A European call option with three months remaining to maturity on an un-
     derlying stock with no additional cash flows has an exercise price (X) of GBP
     50, a risk-free rate of 2%, and a current underlying price (St) of GBP 57.50. If
     the current call option price is GBP 10, which response below most closely
     shows the correct exercise value and the time value of the option?
      A. Exercise value = GBP 7.50; Time value = GBP 2.50
      B. Exercise value = GBP 7.75; Time value = GBP 2.25
      C. Exercise value = GBP 0; Time value = GBP 10
     Solution:
     B is correct. An option’s value comprises its exercise value plus its time val-
     ue. The exercise value of a call option is Max (0, St − PV(X)) and is calculat-
     ed as follows:

      	​Call Option Exercise Value = Max​(0, ​St​​− X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​

      Max(0, GBP 57.50 − GBP 50(1.02)−0.25)

      = GBP 7.75
     The exercise value is positive, as the current underlying price exceeds the
     present value of the exercise price. The time value is the difference between
     the option price and the exercise value, representing the possibility that the
     option payoff at maturity will exceed the current exercise value due to a
     favorable price change:

      	​Call Option Time Value = ​c​t​− Max​(0, ​St​​− X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​

      = GBP 2.25 (= GBP 10 − GBP 7.75)
     The time value is always positive and declines to zero at maturity (t = T).
     A is incorrect as the present value term is omitted from the exercise value
     calculation. C is incorrect as it implies the option has zero exercise value.

                          4. Match the following underlying price and exercise price relationships with
                             their associated put option:

                                                                          ​




                            Solution:
                            Put options are in the money when ST < X, at the money when ST = X, and
                            out of the money when ST > X. Therefore:

                             1. A is correct. Since ST = X = 100, this is an at-the-money put option.
                             2. C is correct. Since ST > X, this is an out-of-the-money put option.
                             3. B is correct. Since ST < X, this is an in-the-money put option.

                          5. Match the following changes in a factor affecting option value (holding oth-
                             er factors constant) with their corresponding option value change:

                           lying price

                            Solution:

                             1. B is correct. A higher exercise price decreases the value of a call
                                option; for a given underlying price at maturity (ST), the call option
                                settlement value of Max (0, ST − X) will decrease for a higher X.
                             2. C is correct. A higher underlying price (ST) will decrease the value of a
                                put option. Since a put option is the right to sell an underlying, the put
                                option settlement value of Max (0, X − ST) will fall as ST rises.
                             3. A is correct. A decline in the volatility of the underlying price will
                                decrease the value of both a call option and a put option. Lower price
                                variability of the underlying will reduce the probability of a higher
                                positive exercise value for a call or a put option without affecting the
                                downside case where the option expires unexercised.

                          6. Which of the following statements provides the correct description as to
                             how a call option’s value changes if the income on the underlying declines
                             unexpectedly, holding all else equal.
                             A. The call option value increases.
                             B. The call option value decreases.
                             C. The call option value does not change.
                            Solution:
                            A is correct. Income or other, non-cash benefits (such as convenience yield)
                            accrue to the owner of an underlying asset but not to the owner of a deriva-
                            tive, whose value is based on the underlying. A call option on an underlying
                            with income has lower value than an identical call option on the same un-
                            derlying without income. Thus, a decline in income on an underlying asset
                            increases the value of a call option.

               explain the exercise value, moneyness, and time value of an option

As shown in earlier lessons, the non-linear or asymmetric payoff profile of an option
causes us to approach these derivative instruments differently than for a forward
commitment. When evaluating these derivatives, whose value depends critically on
whether the spot price crosses an exercise threshold at maturity, buyers and sellers
frequently rely on three measures—exercise value, moneyness, and time value—to
gauge an option’s value over the life of the contract. Recall from an earlier lesson
that American options can be exercised at any time, while European options can be
exercised only at maturity. This lesson focuses solely on European options with no
additional cost or benefit of owning the underlying asset.




OPTION EXERCISE VALUE
                                                                                            3
               explain the exercise value, moneyness, and time value of an option

An option buyer will exercise a call or put option at maturity only if it returns a pos-
itive payoff—that is:
    ■   (ST − X) > 0 for a call
    ■   (X − ST) > 0 for a put
    If not exercised, the option expires worthless and the option buyer’s loss equals
the premium paid.
    At any time before maturity (t < T), buyers and sellers often gauge an option’s value
by comparing the underlying spot price (St) with the exercise price (X) to determine
the option’s exercise value at time t. This is the option contract’s value if the option
were exercisable at time t. The exercise value for a call and a put option at time t
incorporating the time value of money is the difference between the spot price (St)
and the present value of the exercise price (PV(X)), as follows:
                               ​ ax​(0, ​St​​− X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​	
   Call Option Exercise Value: M                                                   (1)

                              ​ ax​(0, X (​ 1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​	
   Put Option Exercise Value: M                                                    (2)
If we assume an exercise price, X, equal to the forward price, F0(T), the exercise value
of a call option is the same as the value of a long forward commitment at time t (Vt(T)).
This forward commitment was shown earlier to equal St − PV(F0(T)), provided thatSt
> PV(X). That is, for a call option where F0(T) = X:
    If St > PV(X):        St − PV(F0(T)) = Max (0, St − PV(X))
    Note that this comparison ignores the upfront call option premium paid by the
option buyer (c0 at time t = 0).

                            months if the spot price (St) equals EUR 950?
                               Use Equation 2 to solve for Max (0, PV(X) − St):

                                	​X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​

                                = EUR 45.04 (= EUR 1,000(1.01)-0.5 − EUR 950)




              4           OPTION MONEYNESS

                                           explain the exercise value, moneyness, and time value of an option

                          An option’s exercise value at any time t was shown to be its current payoff. The rela-
                          tionship between the option’s total value and its exercise price expresses the option’s
                          moneyness. Examples of in-the-money (ITM) options include a call option whose
                          underlying spot price is above the exercise price (X) and a put option with an under-
                          lying spot price below the exercise price. When the underlying price is equal to the
                          exercise price, the put or call option is said to be at the money (ATM). When the
                          underlying price is below (above) the exercise price for a call (put) option, the option
                          is less likely to be exercised and is said to be out of the money (OTM).
                               Also, the degree to which an option is in or out of the money affects the sen-
                          sitivity of an option’s price to underlying price changes. For example, a so-called
                          deep-in-the-money option, or one that is highly likely to be exercised, usually demon-
                          strates a nearly one-to-one correspondence between option price and underlying price
                          changes. A deep-out-of-the-money option, which is very unlikely to be exercised,
                          demonstrates far less option price sensitivity for a given underlying price change. In
                          contrast, relatively small price changes in the underlying for an at-the-money option
                          often determine whether the option will be exercised. Moneyness is often used to
                          compare options on the same underlying but with different exercise prices and/or
                          times to maturity. Exhibit 1 shows the moneyness of a call option at maturity and
                          summarizes these relationships.

EXAMPLE 2

   Put Option Moneyness
   Recall in Example 1 that at time t, a put option with six months remaining to
   maturity had an exercise price (X) of EUR 1,000 and an underlying spot price
   (St) of EUR 950. Describe the moneyness of the put option at time t.
       Given that the underlying spot price is below the exercise price, the put
   option is in the money by EUR 50.




OPTION TIME VALUE
                                                                                             5
              explain the exercise value, moneyness, and time value of an option

While the exercise value of an option reflects its current payoff, an additional com-
ponent of an option’s value is derived from its remaining time to maturity. Although
European options can be exercised only at maturity, they can be purchased or sold
prior to maturity at a price (ct or pt, for a call or put, respectively) that reflects the
option’s future expected payoff. A longer time until expiration usually means a higher
potential dispersion of the future underlying price for a given level of volatility.
178   Learning Module 8                                                                                   Pricing and Valuation of Options


                          Similarly, an increase in volatility at a specific underlying price for a given time to
                          expiration increases option value for the same reason. We will explore these factors
                          further in a later lesson.
                              The time value of an option is equal to the difference between the current option
                          price and the option’s current payoff (or exercise value):
                             Call Option Time Value: ​Max​(0, ​St​​− X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​	                                            (3)

                             or: ​c​t​ = Max​(0, ​St​​− X (​ 1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​+ Time Value​

                             Put Option Time Value: ​p​t​− Max​(0, X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​	                                       (4)

                             or: ​p​t​ = Max​(0, X (​ 1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​+ Time Value​
                          That is, the current option price is equal to the sum of its exercise value and time
                          value. As Exhibit 2 shows, the time value of an option is always positive but declines
                          to zero at maturity, a process referred to as time value decay.

QUESTION SET

  Option Value relative to Underlying Spot Price

  1. Describe the similarities and differences between the exercise value of a long
     put option position with an exercise price (X) equal to the forward price,
     F0(T), and a short forward position payoff at maturity with the same under-
     lying details.
     Solution:
     The exercise value of a put option with an exercise price of X = F0(T) at ma-
     turity (Max (0, X − ST)) is the same as the payoff of a short forward commit-
     ment at maturity (F0(T) − ST) as long as the exercise price is greater than the
     underlying price. That is, for F0(T) = X:
      If X > ST: F0(T) − ST = Max (0, X − ST)
     These payoff profiles will differ if ST > X, since the short forward payoff at
     maturity will require a payment from the seller to the buyer, while the put
     option owner will allow the option to expire unexercised. Note that this pay-
     off comparison ignores the upfront option premium paid by the put option
     buyer (p0) at time t = 0.

  2. A European put option with three months remaining to maturity on an
     underlying stock with no additional cash flows has an exercise price (X) of
     GBP 50, a risk-free rate of 2%, and a current underlying price (St) of GBP 55.
     If the current put option price is GBP 5, calculate the exercise value and the
     time value and interpret the results.
     Solution:
     An option’s value comprises its exercise value plus its time value. The ex-
     ercise value of a put option is Max (0, PV(X) − St) and can be calculated as
     follows:

      	​Put Option Exercise Value = Max​(0, X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​

      Max(0, GBP 50(1.02)-0.25 − GBP 55)

      =0
     The exercise value is zero, as the current underlying price exceeds the
     present value of the exercise price. The time value is the difference between
     the option price and the exercise value and represents the possibility that
     the likelihood and profitability of exercise at maturity may increase due to a
     favorable price change:

      	​Put Option Time Value = ​p​t​− Max​(0, X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​

                                = GBP 5 (= GBP 5 − GBP 0)
                                The time value is always positive and declines to zero at maturity (t = T).
                                Since the put option is out of the money, its value consists solely of time
                                value.

                             3. Match the following underlying price and exercise price relationships with
                                their associated call option:
                                                                       ​

                                  2. ST = 50, X = 50                B. An in-the-money call option
                                  3. ST = 40, X = 50                C. An out-of-the-money call option
                                                                       ​




                                Solution:
                                Call options are in the money when ST > X, at the money when ST = X, and
                                out of the money when ST < X. Therefore:

                                1. B is correct. Since ST > X, this is an in-the-money call option.
                                2. A is correct. Since ST = X = 50, this is an at-the-money call option.
                                3. C is correct. Since ST < X, this is an out-of-the-money call option.

                             4. Describe how the moneyness of an option affects how the option’s value will
                                change for a given change in the price of the underlying.
                                Solution:
                                An increase in the moneyness of an option will increase the sensitivity of its
                                value to changes in the underlying price. For example, an option that is very
                                likely to be exercised will have a nearly one-to-one change in option value
                                for a given change in the underlying price, while an option that is unlikely to
                                be exercised will have a relatively small change in value for a given change in
                                the underlying price.




              6           ARBITRAGE

                                        contrast the use of arbitrage and replication concepts in pricing
                                        forward commitments and contingent claims

                          An earlier lesson showed that riskless arbitrage opportunities arise if the “law of one
                          price” does not hold—that is, an identical asset trades at different prices in different
                          places at the same time. In the case of a derivative, we establish no-arbitrage conditions
                          based on the payoff profile at maturity. As shown earlier, forward commitments with
                          a symmetric payoff profile settle based on the difference between the forward price,
                          F0(T), at contract inception (t = 0) and the underlying price, ST, at contract maturity
                          (t = T), or (ST − F0(T)) for a long forward position. For an underlying with no addi-
                          tional cash flows, it was shown that assets with a known future price must have a
                          spot price equal to the future price discounted at the risk-free rate, r: S0 = ST(1 + r)-T.
                          For purposes of this lesson, we ignore any costs or benefits of owning the underlying
                          other than the opportunity cost (or the risk-free rate, r).
Arbitrage                                                                                          181


    Contingent claims are characterized by asymmetric payoff profiles, introduced
earlier. In the case of European options representing the right to purchase an under-
lying (or call option, c) or the right to sell an underlying (or put option, p) at a given
exercise price (X) at maturity, the payoff profiles at maturity for an option buyer were
shown to be:
   cT = Max (0, ST − X)                                                                      (5)

   pT = Max (0, X − ST)                                                                      (6)

Recall that, unlike forward commitments with an initial price of zero, the option
buyer pays the seller a premium (c0 for a call and p0 for a put at time t = 0), so the
option buyer’s profit at maturity was introduced earlier as follows (ignoring the time
value of money):
   Π = Max (0, ST − X) − c0                                                                  (7)

   Π = Max (0, X − ST) − p0                                                                  (8)
Equations 7 and 8 show the key distinction between forward commitments and con-
tingent claims for purposes of arbitrage. The forward buyer enters into the contract
with no cash paid upfront and has an unlimited gain or loss (bounded by zero for
an underlying such as a stock that cannot have a negative price) at maturity as the
underlying price rises or falls. The option buyer, in contrast, will exercise an option
at maturity only if it is in the money. This conditional nature of option payoff profiles
leads us to establish upper and lower no-arbitrage price bounds at any time t.
    A call option buyer will exercise only if the spot price (ST) exceeds the exercise
price (X) at maturity. The lower bound of a call price is therefore the underlying’s
price minus the present value of its exercise price or zero, whichever is greater. In
other words, an option which trades below its exercise value violates the no-arbitrage
condition. The call buyer will not pay more for the right to purchase an underlying
than the price of that underlying, which is the upper bound:
   	​Max​(0, ​St​​− X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​ < ​c​t​ ≤ ​St​​	                                  (9)

   	​c​t,Lower bound​ = Max​(0, ​St​​− X (​ 1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​	                             (10)

   	​c​t,Upper bound=​St​​​	                                                                (11)
182   Learning Module 8                                                                        Pricing and Valuation of Options


                          A put option buyer will exercise only if the spot price, ST, is below X at maturity.
                          The exercise price, X, therefore represents the upper bound on the put value. The
                          lower bound is the present value of the exercise price minus the spot price or zero,
                          whichever is greater:
                             	​Max​(0, X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​ < ​p​t​ ≤ X​	                                      (12)

                             Consider a one-year call option with an exercise price, X, of EUR 1,000. The
                             underlying asset, S0, trades at EUR 990 at time t = 0 and the risk-free rate, r, is
                             1%. What are the no-arbitrage upper and lower bounds in six months’ time if
                             the underlying asset price, St, equals EUR 1,050?
                                 As the option buyer will exercise only if ST > X at t = T, the lower bound is
                             equal to St − PV (X) or zero, whichever is greater:

                                           contrast the use of arbitrage and replication concepts in pricing
                                           forward commitments and contingent claims

                          In an earlier lesson, we used replication to create forward commitment cash flows,
                          utilizing a combination of long or short positions in an underlying asset and borrowing
                          or lending cash. The ability of market participants to use replication strategies ensures
                          that the law of one price holds and no riskless arbitrage profit opportunities exist.
                              Recall from an earlier lesson that a call option is similar to a long forward posi-
                          tion in that it increases in value as the underlying price rises but differs in that the
                          call option settles only if there is a gain upon exercise. This apparent symmetry for
                          positive outcomes is shown in Exhibit 4, where the exercise price, X, is equal to the
                          forward price, F0(T).

In order to replicate the call option at contract inception (t = 0), we also must borrow
at the risk-free rate, r, and use the proceeds to purchase the underlying at a price of
S0. At option expiration (t = T), unlike in the case of the forward commitment, there
are two possible replication outcomes:
    ■   Exercise (ST > X): Sell the underlying for ST and use the proceeds to repay
        X.
    ■   No exercise (ST < X): No settlement is required.
    If exercise were certain, we would borrow X(1 + r)-T at inception, as in the case of
the forward. However, since it is uncertain, we instead borrow a proportion of X(1 +
r)-T based on the likelihood of exercise at time T, which is closely associated with the
moneyness of an option. The non-linear payoff profile of an option requires that the
replicating transaction be adjusted as this likelihood changes, while the replicating
trades for a forward commitment remain constant. Option replication will be addressed
in greater detail in later lessons.
    We now turn our attention to put option replication. It was shown earlier that a
short put position with an exercise price equal to the forward price (X = F0(T)) mirrors
the outcomes for a long forward position when the underlying price at maturity is
below the forward price (ST < X = F0(T)). The sold put decreases in value as the under-
lying price falls, but it settles only if there is a gain upon exercise. This relationship is
shown in Exhibit 5, where the exercise price (X) is equal to the forward price, F0(T).

                          In order to replicate the put option at contract inception (t = 0), we must sell the
                          underlying short at a price of S0 and lend the proceeds at the risk-free rate, r. At
                          option expiration (t = T), unlike in the case of the forward commitment, there are
                          two possible replication outcomes:
                              ■    Exercise (ST < X): Purchase the underlying for ST from the proceeds of the
                                   risk-free loan.
                              ■    No exercise (ST > X): No settlement is required.
                              If exercise were certain, we would lend X(1 + r)-T at inception, as in the case of
                          the forward. However, as in the case of the call option, the asymmetric payoff profile
                          requires adjustment over time based on the likelihood of exercise.
                              In the next lesson, we will turn our attention to the factors that drive the likelihood
                          of option exercise prior to maturity.

                             Arbitrage and Replication

                             1. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentence: The
                                lower bound of a call price is the underlying’s price ______ the present value
                                of its ________ price or zero, whichever is greater.
                                  Solution:
                                  The lower bound of a call price is the underlying’s price minus the present
                                  value of its exercise price or zero, whichever is greater.

                                cash flows has an exercise price (X) of GBP 50, an initial underlying price
Replication                                                                                       185


      (S0) of GBP 49.75, and a risk-free rate of 2%. Calculate the lower bound of
      the call price in three months’ time if St = GBP 65.
      Solution:
      As the call option buyer will exercise only if ST > X at maturity, the lower
      bound is equal to St − PV (X) or zero in three months’ time, whichever is
      greater:

      	​c​t,Lower bound​ = Max​(0, ​St​​− X (​ 1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​

      Given St = GBP 65, X = GBP 50, r = 2%, and (T − t) = 0.25, we can solve for
      the call option’s lower bound as follows:

      	​c​t,Lower bound​ = Max​(0, GBP65 − GBP50 ​(1.02)​−​(0.25)​​)​

      = GBP 15.25

                                                     ​




      Solution:

      1. B is correct. At time t = 0, a call option replication strategy involves
         borrowing at the risk-free rate and purchasing the underlying.
      2. A is correct. As both call and put options have a non-linear payoff
         profile, the replication strategy requires adjustment over time as the
         likelihood of exercise changes.
      3. C is correct. A put option replication strategy if exercised involves
         receiving the loan repayment and purchasing the underlying at ST at
         time t = T.

   4. Explain the key difference between the changes in the replication of a con-
      tingent claim versus a forward commitment over the life of the contract.
      Solution:
      An option has an asymmetric payoff profile, since the option buyer will ex-
      ercise only if the exercise value of the option is positive. Since the likelihood
      of option exercise changes over time, transactions replicating an option con-
      tract must be adjusted over time. A forward commitment has a symmetric
      payoff profile that will settle with certainty at a future date, and therefore the
      replicating transactions do not require adjustment over the contract life.

              8           FACTORS AFFECTING OPTION VALUE

                                        identify the factors that determine the value of an option and
                                        describe how each factor affects the value of an option

                          We now turn our attention to identifying and describing factors that affect an option’s
                          value. Several of these factors are common to both forward commitments and options,
                          and a number are unique to contingent claims. Factors that determine the value of an
                          option include the value of the underlying, the exercise price, the time to maturity, the
                          risk-free rate, the volatility of the underlying price, and any income or cost associated
                          with owning the underlying asset.


                          Value of the Underlying
                          Changes in the value of the underlying will have the same directional effect on the right
                          to transact the underlying under an option contract as on the obligation to transact
                          under a forward commitment. For example, a call option and a long forward position
                          will both appreciate if the spot price of the underlying rises, while a put option and
                          a short forward position will both appreciate if the spot price of the underlying falls,
                          as shown in Exhibit 6.

A key distinction between forward commitments and contingent claims is the mag-
nitude of a derivative’s price change for a given change in the underlying value. For a
forward commitment, the derivative’s value is a linear (one-for-one) function of the
underlying price, while for an option it is a non-linear relationship that depends on
the likelihood that an option buyer will exercise in the future. The more likely it is
that the option buyer will exercise (e.g., when the option is in the money), the more
sensitive the option’s value to the underlying price. This likelihood depends on the
relationship between the value of the underlying and the exercise price, a feature
unique to option contracts that we turn to next.


Exercise Price
The exercise price is the threshold that determines whether an option buyer chooses
to transact at contract maturity. For a call option representing the right to buy the
underlying, the exercise price represents a lower bound on the option’s exercise value
at maturity, leading to a higher option value for a lower exercise price. As call options
settle based on Max (0, ST − X) at expiry, a lower X will increase both the likelihood
of exercise and the settlement value if exercised.
    The exercise price of a put option, in contrast, is an upper bound on its exercise
value at maturity. A higher exercise price at which a put option buyer has the right
to sell the underlying will therefore increase the value of the option. Exhibit 7 shows
these differing effects of exercise price changes for both call and put options.

                          Time to Expiration
                          Recall from a prior lesson that the time value, or difference between an option’s price
                          and its exercise value, represents the likelihood that favorable changes to the underlying
                          price will increase the profitability of exercise. Unlike a long forward position where
                          the buyer is equally likely to experience an increase or a decrease in the underlying
                          price over a longer period, the one-sided (or asymmetric) payoff profile of an option
                          allows the buyer to ignore any outcomes where the option will expire unexercised.
                              For a call option, a longer time to expiration will increase the option’s value in all
                          cases. The price appreciation potential of an underlying is essentially unlimited and
                          increases over longer periods, while the downside is limited to the loss of the premium.
                              A put option representing the right to sell the underlying also usually benefits from
                          the passage of time. In the case of a put option, a longer time to expiration offers greater
                          potential for price depreciation below the exercise price, while the loss is limited to the
                          premium if the underlying price rises. However, as put option buyers await the sale
                          of the underlying in order to receive (X − ST) upon exercise, a longer time to expiry
                          reduces the present value of the payoff. While less common, in some cases a longer
                          time to expiration will lower a put’s value, especially for deep-in-the-money puts with
                          a longer time to expiration and a higher risk-free rate of interest.


                          Risk-Free Interest Rate
                          An earlier lesson showed the risk-free rate to be the opportunity cost of holding an
                          asset, which extends to the no-arbitrage valuation of derivatives. For example, an
                          option’s exercise value was shown to be equal to the difference between the spot price
                          and the present value of the exercise price:
                             Call Option Exercise Value: Max (0, (St − PV(X)))

                             Put Option Exercise Value: Max (0, (PV(X) − St))
                          A higher risk-free rate therefore lowers the present value of the exercise price provided
                          an option is in the money. A higher risk-free rate will increase the exercise value of
                          a call option and decrease the exercise value of a put option. Note that the risk-free
                          rate does not directly affect the time value of an option.


                          Volatility of the Underlying
                          Volatility is a measure of the expected dispersion of an underlying asset’s future price
                          movements. Higher price volatility of the underlying increases the likelihood of a
                          higher positive exercise value without affecting the downside case in which the option
                          expires unexercised, as shown in Exhibit 8. Note that this effect will be the same for
                          both call options and put options.
                               For example, as volatility rises, a wider range of possible underlying prices increases
                          an option’s time value and the likelihood that it will end up in the money. Lower vol-
                          atility will reduce the time value of both put and call options.

Income or Cost Related to Owning Underlying Asset
In a prior lesson, the benefits and costs of owning an underlying asset over time
were shown to affect the relationship of spot versus forward prices. For example,
income or other, non-cash benefits (such as convenience yield) accrue to the owner
of an underlying asset but not to the owner of a derivative. This effect holds for both
forward commitments and contingent claims. Income or other benefits of ownership
decrease the value of a call and increase the value of a put. Carry costs (such as stor-
age and insurance for commodities) have the opposite effect, increasing the value of
a call option and decreasing the value of a put. A summary of the factors that affect
an option’s value is provided in Exhibit 9, with the sign on the option value referring
to the impact (positive or negative) of an increase in the factor.

                          QUESTION SET

                           Factors That Affect Option Value

                           1. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentence: For a
                              call option representing the right to buy the underlying, the exercise price
                              represents a ______ bound on an option’s exercise value at maturity, leading
                              to a ______ option value for a lower exercise price.
                              Solution:
                              For a call option representing the right to buy the underlying, the exercise
                              price represents a lower bound on an option’s exercise value at maturity,
                              leading to a higher option value for a lower exercise price.

                           2. Match the following changes in factors affecting option value (holding other
                              factors constant) with their corresponding option value change:
                                                                            ​




                            1. A lower exercise price (X)                       A. Increases the value of both a call
                                                                                option and a put option
                            2. A lower underlying price (ST)                    B. Increases the value of a call option
                            3. A rise in the volatility of the underlying       C. Increases the value of a put option
                            price
                                                                            ​




                              Solution:

                              1. B is correct. A lower exercise price increases the value of a call option,
                                 since for a given underlying price at maturity of ST, the call option
                                 settlement value of Max (0, ST − X) will increase for a lower X.
                              2. C is correct. A lower underlying price (ST) will increase the value of a
                                 put option. Since a put option is the right to sell an underlying at the
                                 exercise price (X), the put option settlement value of Max (0, X − ST)
                                 will increase as ST declines.
                              3. A is correct. A rise in the volatility of the underlying price will increase
                                 the value of both a call option and a put option. Greater price variabil-
                                 ity of the underlying will increase the probability of a higher positive
                                 exercise value for a call or a put option without affecting the downside
                                 case where the option expires unexercised.

                           3. Determine the correct answers to complete the following sentences: A key
                              distinction between forward commitments and contingent claims is the
                              __________ of a derivative’s price change for a given change in the underly-
                              ing value. For a forward commitment, the derivative value is a ______ func-
                              tion of the underlying price, while for an option it is a _______ relationship.
                              Solution:
                              A key distinction between forward commitments and contingent claims
                              is the magnitude of a derivative’s price change for a given change in the
                              underlying value. For a forward commitment, the derivative value is a
                              linear function of the underlying price, while for an option it is a non-linear
                              relationship.
Factors Affecting Option Value                                                             191


   4. Explain the effect of a decrease in the risk-free rate of interest on the value of
      put and call options and justify your answer.
      Solution:
      A decrease in the risk-free rate increases the present value of an option’s ex-
      ercise price (PV(X)). The exercise value for an in-the-money call option will
      fall, since (St − PV(X)) is lower for a higher PV(X), while the exercise value
      for an in-the-money put option will rise, since (PV(X) − St) rises for a higher
      PV(X). Note that the time value of an option is not directly affected by the
      risk-free rate.

                             PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                          The following information relates to questions
                          1-9
                             The Viswan Family Office (VFO) owns non-dividend-paying shares of Biomian
                             Limited that are currently priced (S0) at INR 295 per share. VFO’s CIO is con-
                             sidering an offer to sell shares at a forward price (F0(T)) of INR 300.84 per share
                             in six months based on a risk-free rate of 4%. You have been asked to advise on
                             the purchase of a put option or the sale of a call option with an exercise price (X)
                             equal to the forward price (F0(T)) as alternatives to a forward share sale.

                          1. Which of the following statements correctly describes the put option and call
                             option premiums given the relationship between Biomian’s current price of INR
                             295 and the exercise price equal to the forward price of INR 300.84?
                             A. The call option’s premium consists solely of time value, and the put option’s
                                premium consists solely of exercise value.

                             B. The call option’s premium consists solely of exercise value, and the put
                                option’s premium consists solely of time value.

                             C. The call option’s premium consists solely of time value, and the put option’s
                                premium consists solely of time value.

                          2. Which of the following statements correctly describes an important distinction
                             between the two strategies of buying a put option and selling a call option with
                             respect to option time value decay?
                             A. Time value decay is a benefit to both option strategies.

                             B. Time value decay is a cost to both option strategies.

                             C. Time value decay is a benefit to selling a call option and a cost to buying a
                                put option.

                          3. VFO is considering the purchase of the put option to hedge against a decline in
                             Biomian’s share price. Which of the following statements best characterizes the
                             trade-off between the put and the forward based on no-arbitrage pricing?
                             A. The gain on the forward sale will equal the purchased put option’s profit at
                                maturity provided the put option ends up in the money at maturity.

                             B. The loss on the forward sale will exceed the loss on the purchased put at
                                maturity if Biomian’s share price exceeds the forward price by more than the
                                initial put premium paid.

                             C. We do not have enough information to answer this question, since we do
                                not know the time value of the option at maturity.

                          4. In evaluating the purchased put strategy (with X = F0(T)), the CIO has asked you
                             to consider selling the put in three months’ time if its price appreciates over that
                             period. Which of the following best characterizes the no-arbitrage put price at
Practice Problems                                                                        193


   that time?
   A. As VFO will exercise only if the spot price is below the exercise price, the
      lower bound of the put price is the greater of zero and the present value of
      the spot price minus the exercise price.

   B. As VFO will exercise only if the spot price is below the exercise price, the
      upper bound of the put price equals the present value of the exercise price
      minus the spot price.

   C. The put price can be no greater than the forward price and no less than the
      greater of zero and the present value of the exercise price minus the spot
      price.

5. VFO is considering a sold call strategy to generate income from the sale of a call.
   In your scenario analysis of the sold call option alternative, VFO has asked you
   to value the call option in three months’ time if Biomian’s spot price is INR 325
   per share. Given an estimated call price of INR 46.41 at that time, which of the
   following correctly reflects the relationship between the call’s exercise value and
   its time value?
   A. The call’s exercise value is INR 24.16, and its time value is INR 22.25.

   B. The call’s exercise value is INR 27.10, and its time value is INR 19.31.

   C. The call’s exercise value is INR 20.99, and its time value is INR 25.42.

6. Which of the following statements correctly describes how VFO could replicate
   selling a call option on Biomian if exercise is certain?
   A. Borrow X(1 + r)–T at the risk-free rate and use the proceeds to buy Biomian
      stock at the current spot price, S0. At expiration, sell the Biomian stock and
      use the proceeds to pay off the loan.

   B. Sell short Biomian stock at the current spot price, S0, and use the proceeds
      to lend X(1 + r)–T at the risk-free rate. At expiration, receive X as repayment
      of the risk-free loan and buy back the Biomian stock.

   C. Sell short Biomian stock at the current spot price, S0, and borrow X(1 + r)–T
      at the risk-free rate. At expiration, pay off the risk-free loan of X and buy
      back the Biomian stock.

7. In comparing the sold call and purchased put strategies at the forward price,
   VFO’s CIO is concerned about how an increase in the volatility of the underly-
   ing Biomian shares affects option premiums. Which of the following statements
   about volatility change and its effect on strategy is most accurate?
   A. An increase in the volatility of the underlying shares has the same effect on
      call and put option values, so this change should not affect VFO’s strategy
      decision.

   B. Since changes in the volatility of the underlying shares have the opposite
      effect on put versus call options, this change will increase the attractiveness
      of the put strategy versus the call strategy.

                             C. An increase in the volatility of the underlying shares will increase both the
                                cost of the purchased put strategy and the premium received on the sold call
                                strategy, so this change will increase the attractiveness of the call strategy
                                versus the put strategy.

                          8. In comparing the Biomian purchased put and sold call strategies, which of the
                             following statements is most correct about how the call and put values are affect-
                             ed by changes in factors other than volatility?
                             A. Changes in the time to expiration and the risk-free rate have a similar
                                directional effect on the put and call strategies, while changes in the exercise
                                price tend to have the opposite effect.

                             B. Changes in the time to expiration tend to have a similar directional effect
                                on the put and call strategies, while changes in the exercise price and the
                                risk-free rate tend to have the opposite effect.

                             C. Changes in the risk-free rate have a similar directional effect on the put and
                                call strategies, while changes in the exercise price and the time to expiration
                                tend to have the opposite effect.

                          9. VFO is concerned about the potential for increasing interest rates in the future.
                             Which of the following statements provides the most correct description as to
                             how rising rates after entering into the two option strategies would affect the
                             option valuations?
                             A. Rising risk-free rates would make the selling a call option strategy more
                                advantageous to VFO because call options increase in value with higher
                                risk-free rates.

                             B. Rising risk-free rates would make the buying a put option strategy more
                                advantageous to VFO because the company locks in the put option pre-
                                mium at lower interest rates.

                             C. Rising risk-free rates are a negative for both option strategies.
Solutions                                                                                   195




   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. The exercise value of both the call and put options are zero because
   the present value of the exercise price is INR 295, which is equivalent to the
   stock price of INR 295. Thus, both option premiums reflect time value only. A is
   incorrect as this statement does not properly account for the discounting of the
   exercise price. B is incorrect as the call option’s premium does not reflect exercise
   value.

2. C is correct. The time value component of an option premium declines toward
   zero as time passes toward the expiration date. A purchased option declines in
   value, all else equal, because of the time value decline. A sold option increases in
   value, all else equal, because of the time value decline. A is incorrect as time value
   decay is a cost to the purchased put option strategy, and B is incorrect as time
   value decay is a benefit to the sold option strategy.

3. The correct answer is B. The loss on the forward sale will be greater than the loss
   on the purchased put at maturity if Biomian’s share price exceeds the forward
   price by more than the initial put premium. VFO’s downside return is limited to
   the put premium paid, while the forward sale has unlimited downside as Biomian
   shares appreciate. A is incorrect as it does not take the put premium paid into
   account, while C is incorrect as the time value of an option is equal to zero at
   maturity.

4. The correct answer is C. The put exercise price, X (equal to F0(T) in this case),
   represents the upper bound on the put value, while the lower bound is the greater
   of the present value of the exercise price minus the spot price and zero:

   	​Max​(0, X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​− ​St​​)​ < ​p​t​ ≤ X​
   A is incorrect, as the lower bound of the put price is the greater of zero and the
   present value of the exercise price minus the spot price, not the present value of
   the spot price minus the exercise price. B is incorrect, as the lower, not the upper,
   bound of the put price equals the present value of the exercise price minus the
   spot price.

5. The correct answer is B. The option price is equal to the sum of the exercise value
   and the time value. A call option’s exercise value is equal to the greater of zero
   and the spot price minus the present value of the exercise price:

   	​Max​(0, ​St​​− X ​(1 + r)​−​(T−t)​​)​

   = Max(0, INR325 − INR300.84(1.04)-0.25)

   = INR27.10
   The time value is equal to the call price minus the exercise value, or INR 19.31 (=
   INR46.41 − INR27.10). A is incorrect as it takes the spot price minus the exercise
   price as the exercise value, while C calculates the exercise value as the present
   value of the spot price minus the exercise price.

6. B is correct. To replicate selling a call option, combine shorting the underlying
   with risk-free lending. This is exactly the opposite strategy to replicate buying
   a call option in which the underlying is purchased with proceeds from risk-free
   borrowing. A is incorrect as this statement describes replicating buying a call
   option. C is incorrect as selling short and borrowing initially creates two cash
196   Learning Module 8                                                            Pricing and Valuation of Options


                             inflows at t = 0 followed by two cash outflows at t = T.

                          7. The correct answer is C. An increase in the volatility of the underlying share
                             price will increase both the upfront premium received on the sold call option and
                             the premium paid on the purchased put option. Therefore, since the purchased
                             put strategy involves an increased upfront payment made by VFO and the sold
                             call strategy involves an increased premium received, the volatility increase will
                             increase the attractiveness of the call strategy versus the put strategy.

                          8. The correct answer is B. Changes in the time to expiration tend to have a sim-
                             ilar directional effect on the put and call strategies (the only exception being
                             deep-in-the-money put options in some cases), while changes in the exercise
                             price and the risk-free rate tend to have the opposite effect.

                          9. C is correct. Because both option strategies (buy a put or sell a call) are short
                             strategies, VFO is delaying cash inflows so higher risk-free rates are negative. A
                             is incorrect as this statement describes the value effect from buying a call option,
                             not from selling. B is incorrect as the locked-in premium will decline after rising
                             risk-free rates.

INTRODUCTION
Previous lessons examined the payoff and profit profiles of call options and put options,
                                                                                            1
the upper and lower bounds of an option’s value, and the factors impacting option
values. In doing so, we contrasted the asymmetry of one-sided option payoffs with
the linear or symmetric payoff of forwards and underlying assets.
    We now extend this analysis further to show that there are ways to combine
options to have an equivalent payoff to that of the underlying and a risk-free asset as
well as a forward commitment. In the first lesson, we demonstrate that the value of
a European call may be used to derive the value of a European put option with the
same underlying details, and vice versa, under a no-arbitrage condition referred to as
put–call parity. In the second lesson, we show how this may be extended to forward
commitments and how the put–call parity relationship may be applied to option and
other investment strategies. We will focus on European options on underlying assets
with no income or benefit.

   LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

       ■   Put–call parity establishes a relationship that allows the price
           of a call option to be derived from the price of a put option
           with the same underlying details and vice versa.
       ■   Put–call parity holds for European options with the same exercise
           price and expiration date, representing a no-arbitrage relationship
           between put option, call option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset
           prices.
       ■   If put–call parity does not hold, then riskless arbitrage profit opportu-
           nities may be available to investors.
198   Learning Module 9                                                     Option Replication Using Put–Call Parity


                              ■   Put–call forward parity extends the put–call parity relationship to for-
                                  ward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position
                                  and a long forward contract plus a risk-free bond.
                              ■   Under put–call forward parity, we may demonstrate that a purchased
                                  put option and a sold call option are equivalent to a long risk-free
                                  bond and short forward position, and a sold put and purchased call
                                  are equivalent to a long forward and short risk-free bond.
                              ■   Put–call parity may be applied beyond option-based strategies in
                                  finance—for example, to demonstrate that equity holders have a posi-
                                  tion equivalent to a purchased call option on the value of the firm with
                                  unlimited upside, while debtholders have a sold put option position on
                                  firm value with limited upside.



                          LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                           These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                           of understanding of this learning module.

                           1. Which of the following statements correctly describes the equivalent to a
                              long position in an underlying according to put–call parity?
                              A. Long a put option on the underlying, short a call option on the under-
                                 lying, and long a risk-free bond
                              B. Short a put option on the underlying, long a call option on the under-
                                 lying, and long a risk-free bond
                              C. Short a put option on the underlying, long a call option on the under-
                                 lying, and short a risk-free bond
                             Solution:
                             B is correct. Put–call parity demonstrates that a long underlying position is
                             equivalent to a sold put option, a purchased call option, and a long risk-free
                             bond. This is shown in the following equation:
                             Put–call parity: S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T implies S0 = –p0 + c0 + X(1 + r)–T.

                           2. Identify which of the following positions has the same no-arbitrage value as
                              which portfolio under put–call parity:
                                                                      ​




                            1. Long call option (c0)                A. Long underlying, short risk-free bond,
                                                                    and short call option
                            2. Short risk-free bond (–X(1 + r)–T)   B. Long underlying, long put option, and
                                                                    short risk-free bond
                            3. Short put option (–p0)               C. Short underlying, long call option, and
                                                                    short put option
                                                                      ​




                             Solution:
                             Recall that the put–call parity relationship may be expressed as
                              S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
                             1. B is correct. A long call option position is the no-arbitrage equivalent of
                             a long underlying position, a long put option, and a short risk-free bond
                             position.
                             2. C is correct. A short risk-free bond position is equivalent to a short un-
                             derlying position, a long call option, and a short put option.
Put–Call Parity                                                                                 199


      3. A is correct. A short put option is equivalent to a long underlying posi-
      tion, a short risk-free bond, and a short call option.

   3. Which of the following statements correctly describes a synthetic protective
      put position according to put–call forward parity?
      A. A long forward contract on the underlying, a long put option on the
         underlying, and short a risk-free bond
      B. A short forward contract on the underlying, a long put option on the
         underlying, and short a risk-free bond
       C. A short forward contract on the underlying, a short put option on the
          underlying, and short a risk-free bond
      Solution:
      A is correct. The formula for put–call forward parity is as follows:
      F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
      Rearranging the terms as follows shows the synthetic protective put position
      on the left-hand side of the equation:
      F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 – X(1 + r)–T = c0.

   4. Which of the following statements best describes a shareholder’s claim in
      terms of an option payoff?
      A. Shareholder payoff resembles the payoff of a put option on firm value.
      B. Shareholder payoff resembles the payoff of a covered call option on
         firm value.
       C. Shareholder payoff resembles the payoff of a call option on firm value.
      Solution:
      C is correct. When considering shareholder claims in option terms, the
      shareholder payoff resembles a call option on firm value.




PUT–CALL PARITY

              explain put–call parity for European options

A prior lesson contrasted no-arbitrage pricing conditions and the replication of cash
flows for forward commitments and contingent claims. Forwards have zero initial value
and their certain payoff, which is replicated at inception by borrowing to purchase the
underlying or selling the underlying and lending the sale proceeds. Option buyers pay
an upfront premium, and their contingent payoff profiles lead us to establish upper and
lower no-arbitrage price bounds. Option replication is similar to that of a forward but
involves borrowing or lending to buy or sell a proportion of the underlying, which is
adjusted as the moneyness of an option changes. We now extend this analysis using
a combination of positions.
    In this section, we show how combining cash and derivative instruments into a
portfolio in a certain way enables us to price and value these positions without directly
modeling them using no-arbitrage conditions. Consider an investor whose goal is to

                          benefit from upward movements in the value of an underlying but who wants to pro-
                          tect her investment from downward movements in the underlying’s value. Consider
                          the following two portfolios, shown in Exhibit 1:
                             1. At t = 0, an investor purchases a call option (c0) on an underlying with an
                                exercise price of X and a risk-free bond today that pays X at t = T. The cost
                                of this strategy is c0 + X(1 + r)–T, where we assume the option expires at
                                time T.
                             2. At t = 0, an investor purchases an underlying unit (S0) and a put option
                                on the underlying (p0) with an exercise price of X at t = T. The cost of this
                                strategy is p0 + S0.
                             Exhibit 1 shows the payoff of the individual components of these two portfolios.

                          At first glance, these portfolios appear to offer the investor a similar opportunity to
                          benefit from underlying asset appreciation without exposure to an underlying price
                          decline below the exercise price.
                               In the first case (Portfolio 1), the investor buys a call option with a positive payoff
                          if the underlying asset price rises above the exercise price (ST > X) and invests cash
                          in a risk-free bond. Since the risk-free asset pays X at time T, the investor pays c0 +
                          X(1 + r)–T at time t = 0. This combination of a purchased call and a risk-free bond is
                          known as a fiduciary call and is shown in Exhibit 2.

In the second instance (Portfolio 2) in Exhibit 1, the investor pays S0 + p0 at inception
and is hedged if the underlying price falls below X. This strategy of holding an under-
lying asset and purchasing a put on the same asset is sometimes called a protective
put. The payoff for Portfolio 2 at time T is shown in Exhibit 3.

                          Despite their differences, these two portfolios have identical payoff profiles, as evi-
                          denced by Exhibit 2 and Exhibit 3. Recall that no-arbitrage conditions require two
                          assets with identical future cash flows to trade at the same price, ignoring transaction
                          costs. In Exhibit 4, we evaluate this in the case of the two portfolios by comparing
                          their cash flows under all possible scenarios at time t = T.

                          and the prices of these portfolios must be equal at t = 0 to satisfy the no-arbitrage
                          condition in a relationship commonly referred to as put–call parity:
                             S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
                          In other words, under put–call parity, at t = 0 the price of the long underlying asset
                          plus the long put must equal the price of the long call plus the risk-free asset.

                          EXAMPLE 1

                             Biomian Put–Call Parity
                             In an earlier example, the Viswan Family Office (VFO) held non-dividend-paying
                             Biomian shares currently priced (S0) at INR295 per share. VFO is considering
                             the purchase of a six-month put on Biomian shares at an exercise price, X, of
                             INR265. If VFO’s chief investment officer observes a traded six-month call option
                             price of INR59 per share for the same INR265 exercise price, what should he
                             expect to pay for the put per share if the relevant risk-free rate is 4%?
                                 From Equation 1, the put–call parity relationship was shown as
                                   S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
                             We can solve for the risk-free bond price as INR259.85 (= INR265(1.04)–0.5)
                             and substitute into Equation 1:
                                   INR295 + p0 = INR59 + INR259.85.

                                   p0 = INR23.85.
                             VFO should expect to pay a six-month put option premium of p0 = INR23.85.

                              Arbitrage profit opportunities arise if these portfolios trade at different prices. As
                          in the case of individual assets, an investor able to borrow and lend at the risk-free
                          rate can earn a riskless profit if either portfolio is mispriced, as shown in the following
                          example.

EXAMPLE 2

   VFO Put–Call Parity Arbitrage Opportunity
   As in Example 1, the Viswan Family Office holds non-dividend-paying Biomian
   shares at a price (S0) of INR295 per share. VFO is considering the purchase of a
   put for which it expects to pay INR23.85 but which is instead currently priced
   at INR30. Assuming a risk-free rate of 4%, identify the arbitrage opportunity
   and the steps VFO might take to earn a riskless profit.
       From Equation 1, the put–call parity relationship is
      S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
   Substituting the values from Example 1 and the current put price into Equation
   1 gives us the following result:
      INR295 + INR30 > INR59 + INR259.85,

      so, S0 + p0 > c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
   By selling the put and the shares and purchasing the call and the risk-free asset
   at t = 0, VFO has a positive cash flow of INR6.15 (= INR295 + INR30 – INR59
   – INR259.85), or S0 + p0 – c0 – X(1 + r)–T, as shown in the following diagram.

OPTION STRATEGIES BASED ON PUT–CALL PARITY

                          The put–call parity relationship established between call option, put option, underly-
                          ing asset, and risk-free asset pricing in the previous section provides the foundation
                          for thinking about replication and pricing of individual derivative positions, cash
                          positions, and option-based strategies.
                              For example, if we rearrange Equation 1 to solve for the put option premium, p0,
                          we find that it may be derived from a combination of a long call option (c0), a long
                          risk-free bond (X(1 + r)–T), and a short position in the underlying (–S0), as shown in
                          Equation 2 and Exhibit 5.
                             p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T – S0.                                                                        (1)
                          Note that Equation 2 is both a statement of what the price of the put option should

These building blocks are used not only to generate riskless profits in the case of
mispricing but also to create other option-based strategies, such as in the following
example.

EXAMPLE 3

   VFO Covered Call Strategy
   Recall from an earlier example that the Viswan Family Office holds non-divi-
   dend-paying Biomian shares currently priced (S0) at INR295 per share. Since
   VFO’s chief investment officer believes Biomian’s share price will appreciate over
   the long term but remain relatively unchanged for the next six months, he would
   like to sell a six-month call option at a INR325 exercise price (X) to generate
   short-term income in what is known as a covered call strategy.
       Using put–call parity, how can he replicate this position using a risk-free
   bond (the risk-free rate is 4%) and a put option, and what is the expected call
   option premium if the put option has a price of INR56?
       The covered call strategy consists of a long position in the underlying and a
   short call option, or (S0 – c0) at inception. Recall from Equation 1 that put–call
   parity is shown as
       S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
   We may rearrange these terms to solve for (S0 – c0):
       S0 – c0 = X(1 + r)–T – p0.
   The covered call position is therefore equivalent to a long risk-free bond and a
   short put option, as shown in the following diagram.

                              We may solve for the no-arbitrage call price, c0, using put–call parity by
                           substituting terms into the following equation:
                              S0 – c0 = X(1 + r)–T – p0.

                              INR295 – c0 = INR325(1.04)–0.5 – INR56.

                              c0 = INR32.31.

                              then the no-arbitrage prices of those portfolios must ________ one another
                              at t = 0 in a relationship commonly referred to as put–call parity.
                             Solution:
                             If two portfolios have cash flows that are identical at time T under each
                             scenario, then the no-arbitrage prices of those portfolios must equal one

                             Solution:

                             1. B is correct. A short call option position is the no-arbitrage equivalent of

                              fiduciary call.
                             Solution:

                             as a fiduciary call.

   4. Identify the following statement as true or false, and justify your answer:
      The covered call strategy consists of a long position in the underlying and a
      long call option, or (S0 + c0) at inception.

PUT–CALL FORWARD PARITY AND OPTION
APPLICATIONS                                                                                  4
              explain put–call forward parity for European options

Forward commitment replication was shown in earlier lessons to involve borrowing at
the risk-free rate to purchase the underlying in the case of a long position or selling the
underlying short and lending the proceeds at the risk-free rate for a short position. We
also showed that a long underlying position combined with a short forward resulted
in a risk-free return. We now incorporate these forward commitment building blocks
into the put–call parity relationship shown in the prior lesson.




PUT–CALL FORWARD PARITY
                                                                                              5
              explain put–call forward parity for European options

In an earlier lesson, we learned that a long underlying asset position can be replicated
by entering a long forward contract and purchasing the risk-free asset. Combining the
synthetic asset with the put–call parity relationship—so, substituting the present value
of F0(T) for S0 in Equation 1—we have what is referred to as put–call forward parity:
   F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.                                            (3)
We can demonstrate put–call forward parity by comparing a synthetic protective put
position to the protective put and fiduciary call positions. Consider a modification of
the portfolios used earlier to demonstrate put–call parity, as follows:
   1. At t = 0, an investor purchases a forward contract and a risk-free bond
      with a face value equal to the forward price, F0(T), and a put option on the
      underlying (p0) with an exercise price of X at t = T.
   2. At t = 0, an investor purchases a call option (c0) on the same underlying
      with an exercise price of X and a risk-free bond that pays X at t = T.
    The first portfolio has replaced the cash underlying position with a synthetic
underlying position using a forward purchase and a risk-free bond. The combination
of the synthetic underlying position and a purchased put on the underlying is known
as a synthetic protective put. Exhibit 7 demonstrates the equivalence of the pro-
tective and synthetic protective puts by comparing their cash flows at both t = 0 and
contract maturity, T.

                          It follows that the cost of the fiduciary call must equal the cost of the synthetic pro-
                          tective put, thereby demonstrating the put–call forward parity relationship:
                             F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 = c0 + X(1+ r)–T.
                          If we rearrange these terms, we can demonstrate that a long put and a short call are
                          equivalent to a long risk-free bond and short forward position:
                             p0 – c0 = [X – F0(T)](1 + r)–T.                                                           (4)
                          Consider the earlier put–call parity example using a synthetic underlying position,
                          as in the following example.

EXAMPLE 4

   VFO Put–Call Forward Parity
   Consider the Viswan Family Office example using a long forward and a risk-free
   bond, rather than a cash underlying position as in the prior example. Biomian
   shares trade at a price (S0) of INR295 per share. VFO is considering the purchase
   of a six-month put on Biomian shares at an exercise price (X) of INR265. If VFO’s
   chief investment officer observes a traded six-month call option price of INR59
   per share for the same INR265 exercise price, what should he expect to pay for
   the put option per share if the relevant risk-free rate is 4%?
       From Equation 5, the put–call forward parity relationship is
      p0 – c0 = [X – F0(T)](1 + r)–T.
   Substituting terms and solving for F0(T) = INR300.84 (= INR295(1.04)0.5),
      p0 – INR59 = (INR265 – INR300.84)(1.04)–0.5.

      p0 = INR23.86.
   VFO should expect to pay a six-month put option premium of p0 = INR23.86.

The insights established by the put–call parity relationship go well beyond option
trading strategies, extending to modeling the value of a firm to describe the interests
and financial claims of capital providers—namely, the owners of a firm’s equity and
the owners of its debt.
    Assume that at time t = 0, a firm with a market value of V0 has access to borrowed
capital in the form of zero-coupon debt with a face value of D. The market value of
the firm’s assets, V0, is equal to the present value of its outstanding debt obligation,
PV(D), and equity, E0: V0 = E0 + PV(D).
    When the debt matures at T, the firm’s debt and assets are distributed between
shareholders and debtholders with two possible outcomes depending on the firm’s
value at time T (V T):
   1. Solvency (V T > D): If the value of the firm (V T) exceeds the face value of
      the debt, or V T > D, at time T, we say the firm is solvent and able to return
      capital to both its shareholders and debtholders.

       ●   Debtholders receive D and are repaid in full.
       ●   Shareholders receive the residual: ET = V T – D.
210   Learning Module 9                                                         Option Replication Using Put–Call Parity


                             2. Insolvency (V T < D): If the value of the firm (V T) is below the face value of
                                the debt, or V T < D, at time T, we say the firm is insolvent. In the event of
                                insolvency, shareholders receive nothing and debtholders are owed more
                                than the value of the firm’s assets. Debtholders therefore receive V T to settle
                                their debt claim of D at time T.

                                  ●     Debtholders have a priority claim on assets and receive V T < D.
                                  ●     Shareholders receive the residual, ET = 0.
                              Unlike the risk-free bond shown in the prior put–call parity lesson, the firm has
                          risky debt, because the bondholders receive D only in the case of solvency (when V T >
                          D). Debtholders therefore demand a premium similar to a put option premium from
                          shareholders in order to assume the risk of insolvency.
                              Shareholders retain unlimited upside potential (if the firm remains solvent and
                          can pay off its debt) and limited downside potential (if the firm becomes insolvent).
                          In contrast, debtholder upside is limited to receiving debt repayment in the event of
                          solvency, and principal and interest are at risk in the downside event of insolvency.
                              Next, we examine the respective payoff profiles at maturity more closely. At t = T,
                             ■   shareholder payoff is max(0, V T – D) and
                             ■   debtholder payoff is min(V T, D).
                             Consider these payoff profiles in terms of options:
                             ■   Shareholders hold a long position in the underlying firm’s assets (V T) and
                                 have purchased a put option on firm value (V T) with an exercise price of D;
                                 that is, max(0, D – V T).
                             ■   Debtholders hold a long position in a risk-free bond (D) and have sold a put
                                 option to shareholders on firm value (V T) with an exercise price of D.
                             The payoff profiles for shareholders versus debtholders is shown in Exhibit 9.

    Note that the shareholder’s combination of a purchased put option and a long
position in the firm’s assets is equivalent to a call option on the firm’s assets. The
risky debt held by the debtholders is a combination of the risk-free debt, D, and the
put option sold to shareholders.
    Revisiting the put–call parity relationship, S0 + p0 = c0 + PV(X), from Equation
1, we may substitute the value of the firm at time 0 (V0) for the underlying asset (S0),
substitute the debt (D) for the risk-free bond (X), and solve for V0 as follows:
   V0 + p0 = c0 + PV(D).

   V0 = c0 + PV(D) – p0.                                                                           (5)
Equation 6 captures the value of the firm’s assets at t = 0 from a shareholder and
debtholder perspective. The shareholder has a position with a payoff similar to that
of a call option on firm value (c0). The debtholder has a position of PV(D) – p0, or
risk-free debt of the firm plus a sold put option on firm value. The put option (p0)
may be interpreted as the credit spread on the firm’s debt, or the premium above the
risk-free rate the firm must pay to debtholders to assume insolvency risk. This put
option increases in value to shareholders as the likelihood of insolvency increases.
From a debtholder’s perspective, the more valuable the sold put, the more credit risk
is present in the firm’s debt.

                           1. Identify the following statement as true or false, and justify your answer: A
                              key link between put–call parity and put–call forward parity is that the cash
                              underlying position is replaced by a synthetic underlying position using a
                              forward purchase and a risk-free bond.
                             Solution:
                             The statement is true. The replacement of the cash underlying position by a
                             synthetic underlying position using a forward purchase and a risk-free bond

                           2. Identify which of the following positions has the same no-arbitrage value as
                              which portfolio under put–call forward parity:
                                                                   ​

                            2. Long risk-free bond (X(1 + r)–T)        B. Forward purchase, long put option,
                                                                       and short risk-free bond
                            3. Long put option (p0)                    C. Long forward purchase, short call
                                                                       option, and long put option
                                                                   ​




                             Solution:
                             Recall that the put–call forward parity relationship may be expressed as
                              F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
                             1. B is correct. A long call option position is the no-arbitrage equivalent of a
                             forward purchase, a long put option, and a short risk-free bond position.
                             2. C is correct. A long risk-free bond position is equivalent to a long forward
                             purchase, a short call option, and a long put option.
                             3. A is correct. A long put option is equivalent to a forward sale, a long risk-
                             free bond, and a long call option.

                           3. Describe the cash flows at the time of option expiration for a synthetic pro-
                              tective put.
                             Solution:
                             A synthetic protective put is the combination of a synthetic underlying po-
                             sition (using a forward purchase and a long risk-free bond position equal to
                             the exercise price) and a purchased put.
                             At the time of option expiration, time T, there are two possible scenarios:
                             Put option exercised (X > ST): If the put option is exercised, an investor re-
                             ceives (X – ST). The risk-free asset returns F0(T), and the forward purchase
                             returns ST – F0(T).
                             The total return equals (X – ST) + [ST – F0(T)] + F0(T) = X.
                             Put option unexercised (X ≤ ST): If the put option is unexercised, it will
                             expire worthless. The risk-free asset returns F0(T), and the forward purchase
                             returns ST – F0(T).
                             The total return equals [ST – F0(T)] + F0(T) = ST.

   4. Describe how a debtholder’s position may be considered similar to the sale
      of a put option on firm value.
      Solution:
      If the value of the firm (V T) is below the face value of its debt outstanding,
      or V T < D at time T, we say the firm is insolvent and debtholders receive less
      than the face value (D) to settle their debt claim. Stated differently, a deb-
      tholder’s payoff is min(D, V T) = D – max(0, D – V T) and equals the debt face
      value (D) minus a put option on firm value (V T) with an exercise price of D,
      which represents a sold put on firm value.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS


                          The following information relates to questions
                          1-6
                             South China Sprintwyck Investments (SCSI)
                             South China Sprintwyck Investments (SCSI) has a Chinese equity portfolio that
                             has outperformed in the first half of the year due to an overweight position in
                             health care industry shares. SCSI is considering option-based alternatives for one
                             of its current overweight positions, ChinaWell Inc. (CWI). CWI has a current
                             price (S0) of CNY127.50 and pays no dividends. The current risk-free rate is 4%.
                             You are a new SCSI analyst hired to evaluate several alternatives for CWI stock.

                          1. SCSI is considering the sale of a three-month call on CWI shares. If you observe
                             a traded put price with the same underlying details, which of the following state-
                             ments best describes how to derive the no-arbitrage call price?
                             A. Using put–call parity, the call price may be derived by subtracting the traded
                                put price from the underlying price less the present value of the exercise
                                price.

                             B. Using put–call parity, the call price may be derived by adding the traded put
                                price to the underlying price less the present value of the exercise price.

                             C. Using put–call parity, the call price may be derived by adding the traded put
                                price to the present value of the exercise price minus the underlying price.

                          2. Due to the recent sharp rise in CWI’s share price, SCSI is recommending that
                             clients consider protective put strategies for three- to six-month tenors. If you
                             observe that a six-month CWI call option at an exercise price of CNY120 is trad-
                             ing at a price of CNY22.60, which answer is closest to what you would expect to
                             pay for a six-month put option with the same underlying terms?
                             A. CNY15.10

                             B. CNY9.83

                             C. CNY12.77

                          3. You realize that the six-month put option on CWI shares is overpriced relative to
                             the no-arbitrage price from Question 2. Which of the following statements best
                             describes the steps you would take to earn a riskless arbitrage profit under this
                             scenario?
                             A. Sell the six-month put option and sell CWI short, investing the proceeds in
                                a call option and a risk-free bond.

                             B. Sell the six-month put option, buy a call option, and borrow at the risk-free
                                rate to buy CWI shares.

                             C. Sell the six-month put option, buy a call option, enter a forward purchase of
                                CWI, and invest in a risk-free bond.

4. In her most recent research note on CWI, SCSI’s equity analyst specifically men-
   tions an increase in CWI’s leverage ratio as a reason for her bearish outlook on
   the stock. Applying the put–call parity relationship to the value of the firm, which
   of the following statements most accurately describes the CWI outlook in terms
   of option pricing?
   A. The shareholder payoff has improved versus debtholders, because they have
      sold a put option on the firm value that has appreciated.

   B. The debtholder payoff has deteriorated versus the shareholders, because
      they are effectively short a put option on the value of the firm equal to the
      value of debt, which has appreciated in value.

   C. The shareholder payoff has improved versus the debtholders, because the
      debtholders have sold a call option on the firm’s assets to the shareholders.

5. Which of the following choices best describes how SCSI could replicate a long
   risk-free bond return using a forward contract on CWI and call and put options
   on CWI?
   A. Short a forward contract on CWI, short a put option on CWI, and long a
      call option on CWI

   B. Long a forward contract on CWI, long a put option on CWI, and short a
      call option on CWI

   C. Long a forward contract on CWI, long a put option on CWI, and long a call
      option on CWI

6. SCSI observes that a 3-month call option on CWI with an exercise price of CNY
   130 trades at a premium of CNY 3. A 3-month forward contract on CWI trades
   at a forward price of CNY 128.76. Which of the following choices is closest to the
   correct premium for a 3-month put option with an exercise price of CNY 130 on
   CWI?
   A. CNY 4.20

   B. CNY 1.20

   C. CNY 0.50

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. The correct answer is B. From Equation 1, the put–call parity relationship is
                             S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
                             We can rearrange these terms to solve for c0: c0 = S0 + p0 – X(1 + r)–T, which
                             shows that the call price may be derived by adding the traded put price to the
                             underlying price less the present value of the exercise price.

                          2. The correct answer is C. If c0 = CNY22.60, S0 = CNY127.50, and PV(X) =
                             CNY117.67 (= 120(1.04)–0.5), we can solve for p0 using put–call parity:
                             S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.

                             p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T – S0.

                             CNY12.77 = 22.60 + 117.67 – 127.50.

                          3. The correct answer is A. Since the put option is overpriced, we would sell it to
                             earn the difference between the price at which it is sold and the no-arbitrage
                             price. The put–call parity relationship, from Equation 1, is
                             S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T.
                             We can rearrange this to demonstrate that the put option value is equivalent to a
                             long call option, a long risk-free bond, and a short position in CWI shares:
                             p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T – S0.
                             Answer A reflects this long risk-free bond and short CWI combination, which
                             has a payoff of X – ST at expiration matching that of the put payoff, whereas
                             Answer B involves a long cash position in CWI and Answer C involves a long
                             synthetic (forward purchase) position in CWI stock.

                          4. The correct answer is B. The debtholder payoff has deteriorated versus the share-
                             holders, because they are effectively short a put option on the value of the firm
                             equal to the value of debt, which has appreciated in value.
                             The debtholder payoff is min(D, V T) = D – max(0, D – V T) and equals the debt
                             face value (D) minus a put option on firm value (V T) with an exercise price of D.
                             Answer A is incorrect because the debtholders, not the shareholders, have sold
                             a put option. C is incorrect, because the shareholders own a call option, but it is
                             not sold by the debtholders.

                          5. B is correct. Using the put–call forward parity equation as follows:
                             F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T
                             And rearranging to solve for the risk-free bond gives the following:
                             F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 – c0 = X(1 + r)–T.
                             The signs on the forward contract and put option positions are both positive,
                             indicating long positions. The negative sign on the call option indicates a short
                             position.

                          6. A is correct. The solution can be derived through either put–call parity or put–
                             call forward parity. You can demonstrate the solution using put–call forward
                             parity:
                             F0(T)(1 + r)–T + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)–T
                             128.76(1.04)–0.25 + p0 = 3 + 130(1.04)–0.25
Solutions                 217


   127.50 + p0 = 131.73
   p0 = 4.23.

INTRODUCTION
Earlier lessons explained how the principle of no arbitrage and replication can be used
                                                                                           1
to value and price derivatives. The put–call parity relationship linked put option, call
option, underlying asset, and risk-free asset prices. This relationship was extended to
forward contracts given the equivalence of an underlying asset position and a long
forward contract plus a risk-free bond.
    Forward commitments can be priced without making assumptions about the under-
lying asset’s price in the future. However, the pricing of options and other contingent
claims requires a model for the evolution of the underlying asset’s future price. The
first lesson introduces the widely-used binomial model to value European put and
call options. A simple one-period version is introduced, which may be extended to
multiple periods and used to value more complex contingent claims. In the second
lesson, we demonstrate the use of risk-neutral probabilities in derivatives pricing.

                           LEARNING MODULE SELF-ASSESSMENT

                            These initial questions are intended to help you gauge your current level
                            of understanding of this learning module.

                            1. Which of the following statements most correctly describes the binomial
                               model for valuing options?
                               A. The model uses the actual probabilities associated with stock price
                                  moves up or down.
                               B. The model assumes that a risk-free portfolio can be created by com-
                                  bining the option and the underlying according to a hedge ratio.
                               C. The model is similar to those used for valuing forward and futures
                                  contracts.
                              Solution:
                              B is correct. Unlike forward commitments, contingent claims, such as
                              options, require that we model the future price behavior of the underlying
                              asset because unlike forwards and futures, options have asymmetric payoffs.
                              By modeling the future price behavior, the option and its underlying asset
                              can be combined into a risk-free portfolio. The cost of this portfolio, where
                              the proportion of the option and the underlying asset is set by a hedge ratio,
                              determines the no-arbitrage price of the option. A is incorrect because the
                              actual probabilities of up and down price moves do not factor into the mod-
                              el. C is incorrect because options have asymmetric payoffs, so they must be
                              modeled differently than symmetric-payoff instruments like forward and
                              futures contracts.

                            2. When using a one-period binomial model to price a call option, an increase
                               in the actual probability of an upward move in the underlying asset will
                               result in the call option price:
                               A. decreasing.
                               B. staying the same.
                               C. increasing.
                              Solution:
                              The correct answer is B. The call option price will stay the same. The actual
                              (real-world) probabilities of an up or a down price movement in a binomial
                              model do not influence the (no-arbitrage) price of an option.

   3. Identify which of the various factor changes has which effect on the no-arbi-
      trage price of a put option based on the one-period binomial model:
                                                ​




    1. The probability of an upward price           A. Put option price remains the same
    movement, q, increases.
    2. The spread between the up and down           B. Put option price increases
    factor, Ru − Rd, increases.
    3. The risk-neutral probability of price,       C. Put option price decreases
    π, increases.
                                                ​




      Solution:
      1. The correct answer is A. The probability of an upward price movement,
      q, has no impact on value in the one-period binomial option pricing model.
      Thus, this change would not have any impact on the price of a put option,
      and the price of the put option would remain the same.
      2. The correct answer is B. The spread between the up and down factor, Ru
      – Rd, increases the range of potential prices, which increases the likelihood
      that the option ends up in the money. Thus, this change would increase the
      price of a put option.
      3. The correct answer is C. The risk-neutral probability of price, π, captures
      the probability of the price of the underlying increasing. As π increases, the
      likelihood of the put option ending up in the money decreases.

   4. A one-period binomial model assumes that the price of the underlying asset
      can change from $16.00 today to either $20.00 or $12.00 at the end of the
      period. If the risk-free rate of return over the period is 5%, which of the fol-
      lowing choices is closest to the risk-neutral probability of a price increase?
      A. 0.50
      B. 0.60
       C. 0.625
      Solution:
      B is correct. An increase from $16.00 to $20.00 or a decrease from $16.00 to
      $12.00 corresponds to:
      Ru = $20.00/$16.00 = 1.25 and Rd = $12.00/$16.00 = 0.75.
      Using the risk-neutral probability (π) of a price increase:
      π = (1 + r – Rd)/(Ru – Rd)
      = (1 + 0.05 – 0.75)/(1.25 – 0.75) = 0.3/0.5 = 0.60.




BINOMIAL VALUATION
                                                                                            2
              explain how to value a derivative using a one-period binomial model

The law of one price states that if the payoffs from any two assets (or portfolio of
assets) at a given future time are identical in all possible scenarios, then the value of
these two assets must also be identical today. Forward commitments offer symmetric
payoffs at a predetermined price in the future, the value of which are independent of
the future price behavior of the underlying asset.

                               The asymmetric payoff profile of options and other contingent claims makes
                           valuation of these instruments more challenging. Assumptions about future prices
                           are an important component in option valuation given the different payoffs under
                           different scenarios whose likelihood changes over time. Option valuation therefore
                           requires the specification of a model for the future (random) price behavior of the
                           option’s underlying asset.
                               The binomial model is a common tool used to determine the no-arbitrage value of
                           an option. The simplicity of this model makes it attractive, as we only need to make
                           an assumption about the magnitude of the potential upward and downward price
                           changes of the underlying asset in a future time period.




              3            THE BINOMIAL MODEL

                                         explain how to value a derivative using a one-period binomial model

                           The binomial model builds on a simple idea: Over a given period of time, the asset’s
                           price will either go up (u) to S1u > S0 or go down (d) to S1d < S0. We do not need
                           to know the future price in advance, because it is determined by the outcome of a
                           random variable. The movement from S0 to either S1u or S1d can be interpreted as
                           the outcome of a Bernoulli trial.
                               Let us denote q as the probability of an upward price movement and 1 − q as the
                           probability of a downward price movement. With only two possible outcomes—the
                           price either goes up or down—the sum of probabilities must equal 1. We will also find
                           it useful to define the gross return from an up or a down price move as:
                              Ru = S1u/S0> 1                                                                  (1)

                              Rd = S1d/S0< 1                                                                  (2)
                           At first glance, it would appear that knowing q is crucial in determining the value of an
                           option on any underlying asset. However, knowing q is not required; only specifying
                           the values of S1u and S1d is needed. The difference between S1u and S1d measures
                           the “spread” of possible future price outcomes. Specifying S1u and S1d (or RuS0 and
                           RdS0) determines the volatility of the underlying asset, an important factor in valuing
                           options as shown earlier. Simply stated, the size of the up and down price movements
                           should match the underlying asset volatility, as shown in Exhibit 1.

Binomial models may be extended to multiple periods where the underlying asset
price can move up or down in each period. This extension creates a binomial tree, a
powerful way to model more realistic price dynamics. A simple one-period binomial
model is sufficient to introduce the pricing methodology and the required steps in
the option pricing procedure.

Consider a one-year European call option with an exercise price (X) of €100. The
underlying spot price (S0) is €80. The one-period binomial model corresponds to the
option’s time to expiration of one year.
    The binomial model specifies the possible values of the underlying asset in one
year, where the option value is a known function of the value of the underlying asset.
Further, we assume that S1d < X < S1u (i.e., the exercise price of the option [X = €100]
is between the value of the underlying in the two scenarios)—for example, setting S1d
= €60 and S1u = €110. Then, Ru = 1.375 and Rd = 0.75. The value of the call option
is as follows:
    ■   At t = 0, the call option value is c0.
    ■   At t = 1, the call option value is either c1u (if the underlying price rises to
        S1u) or c1d (if the underlying price falls to S1d).

        ●   Up move to S1u: Call option ends up in-the-money

   	​c​1u​ = Max​(0, ​S1​u​ − X)​ = Max​(0, €110 − €100)​ = €10.​

        ●   Down move to S1d:Call option expires out-of-the-money

   	​c​1d​ = Max​(0, ​S1​d​ − X)​ = Max​(0, €60 − €100)​ = 0.​

lying asset and call option.

                           The only unknown value is c0, which may be determined using replication and
                           no-arbitrage pricing. That is, the value of both the option and its underlying asset
                           in each future scenario may be used to construct a risk-free portfolio. For example,
                           assume that at t = 0 we sell the call option at a price of c0 and purchase h units of
                           the underlying asset. Denoting the value of the portfolio as V, we have the following:
                              V0= hS0 – c0                                                                                     (3)

                              V1u = hS1u – c1u = h × Ru × S0 – Max(0, S1u – X)                                                 (4)

                              V1d = hS1d – c1d = h × Rd × S0 – Max(0, S1d – X)                                                 (5)
                           V0 represents the initial portfolio investment in the portfolio, and V1u and V1d represent
                           the portfolio value if the underlying price moves up or down, respectively. We must
                           choose h so that V1u = V1d (i.e., the portfolio value is the same in either scenario). The
                           value of the combination, V1, will not change if the underlying asset price changes.
                           For portfolio V0, the impacts of the changes are as follows:
                               ■       Up move from S0 to S1u by Ru:

                                       ●    The asset value changes from €80 to €110 by 1.375, or 37.5%.
                                       ●    The call option ends up in-the-money:

                              	​c​1u​ = Max​(0, ​S1​u​ − X)​ = Max​(0, €110 − €100)​ = €10.​

                                       ●    Total portfolio value: V1u = hS1u – c1u = €110 × h − €10.
                               ■       Down move from S0 to S1d by Rd:

                                       ●    The asset value changes from €80 to €60 by 0.75, or –25%.
                                       ●    The call option expires out-of-the-money:

                              	​c​1d​ = Max​(0, ​S1​d​ − X)​ = Max​(0, €60 − €100)​ = 0.​

                                       ●    Total portfolio value: V1d = hS1d – c1d = €60 × h.
                               Since we create two portfolios at time t = 0 with identical payoffs at option expiry
                           at time t = 1, we must solve for h, the ratio between the underlying asset, S0, and the
                           call option, c0, such that V1u = V1d, or hS1u – c1u = hS1d – c1d. Solving for h* yields:

    where all quantities on the right-hand side are known at t = 0. Equation 4 gives
us the hedge ratio of the option, or the proportion of the underlying that will offset
the risk associated with an option. In our sold call option example,

For each call option unit sold, we buy 0.2 units of the underlying asset (or for each
underlying asset unit, we must sell 5 call options to equate the portfolio values at t =
1). Consider the two scenarios as follows:
    ■    Up move from S0 to S1u by Ru:

         ●     Total portfolio value: V1u = hS1u – c1u

   = €110 × 0.20 − €10 = €22 – 10 = €12.

    ■    Down move from S0 to S1d by Rd:

         ●     Total portfolio value V1d = hS1d – c1d = €60 × 0.20 = €12.
   The portfolio values are the same, V1u = V1d, which has two implications:
   1. We can use either portfolio to value the derivative, and
   2. The return V1u / V0= V1d / V0 must equal one plus the risk-free rate.
   Exhibit 3 summarizes these results.

This hedging approach is not specific to call options and can be used for any derivative
contract whose value is entirely determined by the underlying asset’s value at t = 1.
   To prevent arbitrage, the portfolio value at t = 1,
   	​V1​ ​ = h × ​R​u​​S0​ ​− ​c​1u​ = h × ​R​d​​S0​ ​− ​c​1d​,​

Based on no-arbitrage pricing and the certain portfolio payoff, V1, the value of the
call option may be shown as:

                           Substituting the information from the previous example, we already established that
                           V1 = €12. For an annual risk-free rate of 5%:
                              c0 = h × S0 − V1(1 + r)−1

                              =0.2 × €80 − €12 (1.05)−1 = €16 − €11.43 = €4.57.
                           The call option price c0 is therefore €4.57. We may confirm an investor in the hedge
                           portfolio would earn the risk-free rate (r) of 5% by comparing the initial portfolio value
                           V0 with the portfolio value after one period of V1 (recalling that V1u = V1d) equal to €12:
                              V0 = h × S0 – c0

                              V0 = €11.43 = €16 - €4.57

                              Hightest Capital
                              Hightest Capital believes that a particular non-dividend-paying stock is currently
                              trading at $50 and is considering the sale of a one-year European call option at
                              an exercise price of $55. Answer the following questions:

                                  1. If the stock price is expected to either go up or down by 20% over the
                                     next year, what price should Hightest expect to receive for the sold call
                                     option? Assume a risk-free rate of 5%.
                                  2. How would the call option price change if the stock price were
                                     expected to either go up or down by 40% over the next year?
                                  3. If Hightest had a more optimistic outlook on the future stock price
                                     (i.e., they estimated a higher probability of the option ending up
                                     in-the-money), how would the expected call option price change?
                                  4. What would be the price of a one-year put option at an exercise price
                                     of $55 if the stock price were expected to change by 20%? 40%?
                              Solution to 1:
                              Denote the initial price of the underlying stock as S0= $50 and the exercise price
                              of the call option as X = $55. If the stock price moves up or down by 20%, then:
                                  	​S1​u​ = ​R​u​​S0​ ​ = 1.2 × $50 = $60.​

                                  	​S1​d​ = ​R​d​​S0​ ​ = 0.8 × $50 = $40.​
                              The price will either move up to $60 or down to $40. Given that the payoff of a
                              call option at expiry is Max(0, ST − X):
                                  	​c​1u​ = Max​(0, ​S1​u​ − X)​ = Max​(0, $60 − $55)​ = $5.​

                                  	​c​1d​ = Max​(0, ​S1​d​ − X)​ = Max​(0, $40 − $55)​ = $0.​
                              The call option value is $5 if the underlying stock increases in price by 20% and
                              zero if it decreases by 20%. The hedge ratio of the option is:
                                            ​(​c​1u​ − ​c​1d​)​    $5.00 − $0       $5.00

                                                                         ​$20.00 ​ = 0.25.​

Pricing a European Call Option                                                            227


   To create a risk-free portfolio, we can sell a call option and purchase 0.25 units
   of the underlying asset today. At maturity, the hedged portfolio value is:

      	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​u​ = ​h​*​​S1​u​ − ​c​1u​ = 0.25 × $60.00 − $5.00 = $10.00.​

      	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​d​ = ​h​*​​S1​d​ − ​c​1d​ = 0.25 × $40.00 − $0.00 = $10.00.​
   We can use either V1u or V1d to compute the certain value, V1, and the present
   value of the hedged position today is:
      V0 = V1(1 + r)−1 = $10.00 × 1.05−1 = $9.52.
   The call option value is:
      c0 = h*S0 − V0 = 0.25 × $50.00 − $9.52 = $12.50 − $9.52 = $2.98.
   The no-arbitrage price of the call option should be $2.98. If not, then investors
   would be able to construct a synthetic risk-free asset using the option and its
   underlying asset with a higher return than the risk-free rate.
        Note that the hedge ratio (0.25 units in this example) is positive in this case
   since the derivative is sold and the underlying is purchased. A negative hedge
   ratio implies that both the derivative and the underlying are purchased or sold
   to create the hedge. Also, while the hedge ratio is usually expressed as a fraction
   of an underlying unit, option contracts are usually traded in larger size, allow-
   ing a round number of underlying assets to be purchased or sold as a hedge.
   It is important that the ratio (4:1 in this case) of options to underlying units is
   maintained in the portfolio.

   Solution to 2:
   If the stock price changes by 40%, then the call option payoff at expiry is:
      	​c​1u​ = Max​(0, ​S1​u​ − X)​ = Max​(0, $70 − $55)​ = $15.​

      	​c​1d​ = Max​(0, ​S1​d​ − X)​ = Max​(0, $30 − $55)​ = 0.​
   The hedge ratio of the option is:
             ​(​c​1u​ − ​c​1d​)​   $15 − $0   $15
      	​h​*​ = _
               ​ u d ​= _
                        ​$70 − $30 ​ = _
                                       ​$40 ​ = 0.375.​
             ​(​S1​ ​ − ​S1​ ​)​

   At maturity, the perfectly hedged portfolio is worth:

      	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​u​ = ​h​*​​S1​u​ − ​c​1u​ = 0.375 × $70 − $15 = $11.25.​

      	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​d​ = ​h​*​​S1​d​ − ​c​1d​ = 0.375 × $30 − $0 = $11.25.​
   The present value of the hedged position at t = 0 is:
      V0 = V1(1 + r)−1 = $11.25 × 1.05−1 = $10.71.
   Then, the call option price at t = 0 is:
      c0 = h*S0 − V0 = 0.375 × $50 − $10.71 = $18.75 − $10.71 = $8.04.
   A higher expected price change indicates higher volatility. An increase in the
   range of future price changes increases the value of the call option.

                            Solution to 3:
                            Since the actual probabilities of an up or a down move in the underlying asset
                            do not affect the no-arbitrage value of the option, the option price that Hightest
                            may charge should not change. Hightest can offset the risk of selling the call
                            by purchasing h* units of the underlying asset, so any directional views on the
                            stock price do not affect the hedge position.

                            Solution to 4:

                            for the put price, when the stock price changes by 20% and the call option price
                            is $2.98, the result can be calculated as:
                               p0 = c0 − S0 + X(1 + r)−T = $2.98 − $50 + $55(1 + 0.05)−1 = $5.36.

                               p0 = c0 − S0 + X(1 + r)−T = $8.04 − $50 + $55(1 + 0.05)−1 = $10.42.

                              To price a contingent claim, such as an option, a model for the future price
                              behavior of the underlying asset is needed due to the asymmetric nature of

                              Solution:
                              The symmetric nature of a forward commitment’s payoff (i.e., the obligation
                              to transact at maturity) allows the commitment to be perfectly replicated
                              without the need to model the future price behavior of the underlying asset.
                              However, the asymmetric nature of a contingent claim’s payoff (i.e., the right
                              but not the obligation to transact at maturity) does require the future price
                              behavior to be modeled.

                               A. in-the-money if the price moves up.
                               B. out-of-the-money if the price moves up.
                               C. at-the-money if the price moves up or down.
                              Solution:
                              The correct answer is B; the option will be out-of-the-money if the price
                              moves up. An at-the-money put option has an exercise price equal to the

      of a call and a put option.
      Solution:
      In a one-period binomial model, the volatility of the underlying asset is rep-
      resented by the spread between the up gross return, Ru, and the down gross
      return, Rd. Therefore, if either the up gross return increases or the down
      gross return decreases (or both), the price of the underlying asset at matu-
      rity will be more volatile. If all else remains equal, then the price of both call
      and put options will increase when the underlying asset is expected to have
      a higher volatility over the life of the option.

   5. A put option on a non-dividend-paying stock has an exercise price, X, of £21
      and six months left to maturity. The current stock price, S0, is £20, and an
      investor believes that the stock’s price in six months’ time will be either 10%
      higher or 10% lower.

      a. Describe how the investor can construct a perfectly hedged portfolio
         using the put option and its underlying stock.
      b. What will the value of the hedged portfolio be in the scenario that the
         stock price rises and the scenario that the stock price falls (assume a
         risk-free rate is 4%)?
       c. What is the no-arbitrage price of the put option?
      Solution:
      a. Denote the initial price of the underlying stock as S0= £20.00 and the
      exercise price of the put option as X = £21.00. If the stock price moves up by
      10%, then:
      	​S1​u​ = ​R​u​​S0​ ​ = 1.1 × £20.00 = £22.00.​
      If the stock price moves down by 10%, then

      	​S1​d​ = ​R​d​​S0​ ​ = 0.9 × £20.00 = £18.00.​
      Given that the payoff of a put option at expiry is Max(0, X − ST):

      	​p​1u​ = Max​(0, X − ​S1​u​)​ = Max​(0, £21.00 − £22.00)​ = £0.​

      	​p​1d​ = Max​(0, X − ​S1​d​)​ = Max​(0, £21.00 − £18.00)​ = £3.00.​
      The put option will be worth £3.00 if the underlying stock decreases in price
      by 10% and worthless if it increases by 10%. The hedge ratio of the option is:

             ​(​p​1u​ − ​p​1d​)​   £0 − £3   £3
      	​h​*​ = _
               ​ u d ​= _
                        ​£22 − £18 ​ = _
                                       ​£4 ​ = − 0.75.​
             ​(​S1​ ​ − ​S1​ ​)​

      So, to create a risk-free portfolio, we can buy the put option and buy 0.75
      units of the underlying asset.
      b. At maturity, the value of the perfectly hedged portfolio is:

      	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​u​ = ​h​*​​S1​u​ + ​p​1u​ = 0.75 × £22 + £0 = £16.50.​

                                   	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​d​ = ​h​*​​S1​d​ + ​p​1d​ = 0.75 × £18 + £3.00 = £16.50.​
                                  We can use either V1u or V1d to compute the certain value, V1, and the pres-
                                  ent value of the hedged position today is:
                                   V0 = V1(1 + r)−1 = £16.50 × 1.04−0.5 = £16.18.
                                  c. The price of the put option is:
                                   p0 = V0 − h*S0− = £16.18 − 0.75 × £20 = £16.18 − £15 = £1.18.
                                  The no-arbitrage price of the put option should be £1.18.

                              6. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: When the
                                 _______________ applies, the rate of return on all (real or synthetic) risk-
                                 free assets should equal the __________.
                                  Solution:
                                  When the law of one price applies, the rate of return on all (real or synthetic)
                                  risk-free assets should equal the risk-free rate.

                                                 describe the concept of risk neutrality in derivatives pricing

                           As shown in the prior lesson, an option’s value is not affected by actual (real-world)
                           probabilities of underlying price increases or decreases. This realization contributed
                           to the growing use of options as it became easier to agree on a given option’s value.
                           As we will see in this lesson, only the expected volatility—that is, gross returns Ru and
                           Rd introduced earlier—and not the expected return are required to price an option.
                               We may generalize the relationship between an option’s value and that of the hedge
                           portfolios from Equation 5 of the prior lesson using the example of a call option c0
                           as follows:
                                         ​(π ​c​1u​ + ​(1 − π)​​c​1d​)​
                                       _____________
                              	​c​0​ =

                                                    ​.​	                                                                  (9)
                                           (     ​1 + r ​ ​
                           The value of the call option today, c0, is computed as the expected value of the option
                           at expiration, c1u and c1d, discounted at the risk-free rate, r. This shows the derivative’s
                           value as similar to any other asset in that it equals the present value of expected future
                           cash flows. In this case, these cash flows are weighted by assumed probabilities that
                           are consistent with risk-neutral returns on the underlying.
                               The risk-neutral probability (π) is the computed probability used in binomial
                           option pricing by which the discounted weighted sum of expected values of the
                           underlying, S1u = RuS0 and S1d = RdS0, equal the current option price. Specifically,
                           this probability is computed using the risk-free rate and assumed up gross return and
                           down gross return of the underlying as in Equation 7.
                                                      d

                              	​π = _                                                                                    (10)

                           More specifically, π, is the risk-neutral probability of an increase in the underlying
                           price to S1u = RuS0, and (1 − π) is that of a decrease, S1d = RdS0.

    Substituting the details from our earlier example, where RuS0= €110, RdS0= €60,
S0= €80, and X = €100, Ru = 1.375 and Rd = 0.75 and assuming an annual risk-free
rate of 5%:

   	​π = _

   =[0.48 × Max(0, €110 − €100) + 0.52 × Max(0, €60 − €100)]/1.05
    = €4.80/1.05 = €4.57, which matches our earlier result from the prior lesson.
    In Equation 7, the risk-neutral probabilities are determined solely by the up
and down gross returns, Ru and Rd, representing underlying asset volatility and the
risk-free rate used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. This no-arbitrage
derivative value established separately from investor views on risk is referred to as
risk-neutral pricing.
    The use of risk-neutral pricing goes well beyond the simple one-period binomial
tree and may be applied to any model that uses future underlying asset price move-
ments, as we will see later in the curriculum.

EXAMPLE 2

   Hightest Capital (revisited)
   Revisiting Example 1 and the European call option sold by Hightest Capital,
   we can now explore the option price using risk-neutral pricing. Answer the
   following questions:

       1. What is the risk-neutral probability of an up move and a down move
          in the one-period binomial model described in Example 1?
       2. Demonstrate how this risk-neutral probability can be used to arrive at
          the no-arbitrage price of the call option.
       3. What would be the value of a European put option on the same stock
          with the same exercise price and expiration date?
       4. Confirm that the call option price computed in question 2 and the put
          option price computed in question 3 both satisfy the put–call parity
          relationship.
   Solution to 1:
   The risk-neutral probability of an up move, denoted π, is:
                             d        1 + 0.05 − 0.8
             ​1 +u r − ​Rd​ ​​ = _
       	​π = _                   ​ 1.2 − 0.8 ​ = 0.625.​
               ​R​ ​− ​R​ ​
   The risk-neutral probability of a down move is therefore:
       1 – π = 1 – 0.625 = 0.375.

   Solution to 2:
   The call option price today is given by the (risk-neutral) expected value of the
   option payoff at maturity, discounted at the risk-free rate, r. In Equation 6:
               ​(π ​c​1u​ + (​ 1 − π)​​c​1d​)​

                            Solution to 3:
                            Since Equation 6 is valid for any European option, the put option value with an
                            exercise price of $55 is:
                                      ​(π ​p​1u​ + ​(1 − π)​​p​1d​)​

                               = $5.625/1.05 = $5.36.
                            Note that we have used the same risk-neutral probability π as in Questions 1 and
                            2, since these values are a function of the binomial model for the underlying asset
                            for a given asset volatility and risk-free rate, not the specific option being priced.

                            Solution to 4:
                            European call and put options with the same exercise price and maturity date
                            must satisfy put–call parity as defined by:
                               S0 + p0 = c0 + X(1 + r)−T = $50 + $5.36 = $2.98 + $55 × 1.05−1 = $55.36,
                            which confirms the relationship.

                            Hedging and Risk Neutrality

                            1. Which of the following factors influences the value of an option price when
                               using a binomial model?
                               A. The risk-free rate of return
                               B. The level of investors’ risk aversion
                                C. The probability of an upward price move
                               Solution:
                               The correct answer is A, the risk-free rate of return. The value of an option
                               is determined by its risk-neutral expectation discounted at the risk-free rate.
                               In a one-period binomial model, the risk-neutral probabilities are deter-
                               mined only by the risk-free rate over the life of the option and the underly-
                               ing asset’s volatility (as measured by the up and down gross returns, Ru and
                               Rd). Because of the ability to construct a perfect hedge of the option using
                               the underlying asset, an option’s price is independent of investors’ risk aver-
                               sion and the probability of the underlying price moving up (or down).

                            2. If the underlying asset price in a one-period binomial model can increase
                               by 15% or decrease by 10% over the period and the prevailing risk-free rate
Risk Neutrality                                                                          233


      over the period is 4%, what is the risk-neutral probability of an asset pricing
      decrease?
      Solution:
      If the underlying asset price in a one-period binomial model can increase by
      15%, then the up gross return is Ru = 1.15. Similarly, if the price can decrease
      by 10%, then the down gross return is Rd = 0.9.
      The risk-neutral probability of an upward price move is:
                         d   1 + 0.04 − 0.9
             ​1 +u r − ​Rd​ ​​ = _
       	​π = _                   ​ 1.15 − 0.9 ​ = 0.56.​
              ​R​ ​− ​R​ ​
      The risk-neutral probability of a downward price move is 1 – 0.56 = 0.44.

   3. Which of the following best describes the risk-neutral pricing interpretation
      of the one-period binomial option pricing formula?
       A. The real-world expected payoff discounted at the risk-free rate
       B. The risk-neutral expected payoff discounted at the risk-free rate
       C. The risk-neutral expected payoff discounted at a risk-adjusted rate
      Solution:
      The correct answer is B, the risk-neutral expected payoff discounted at the
      risk-free rate. The risk-neutral pricing interpretation of the option pricing
      formula states that the value of an option today is its risk-neutral expected
      value at maturity, discounted at the risk-free rate.

   4. Determine the correct answers to fill in the blanks: If a call option is trading
      at a higher price than that implied from the binomial model, investors can
      earn a return in excess of the risk-free rate by ________ at the risk-free rate,
      __________ the call, and _________ the underlying.
      Solution:
      If a call option is trading at a higher price than that implied from the bi-
      nomial model, investors can earn a return in excess of the risk-free rate by
      borrowing at the risk-free rate, selling the call, and buying the underlying.
      A synthetic risk-free asset can be created by this strategy that earns a return
      higher than the risk-free rate. Selling the over-priced call will provide a
      higher cash inflow than is required to generate the risk-free rate of return.

   5. A stock’s price is currently ¥8,000. At the end of one month when its options
      expire, the stock price is either up by 5% or down by 15%. If the risk-free rate
      is –0.20% for the period, what is the value of a put option with a strike price
      of ¥7,950?
       A. ¥333.67
       B. ¥299.60
       C. ¥236.93
      Solution:
      The correct answer is B, ¥299.60. Using risk-neutral pricing, we can deter-
      mine the risk-neutral probability as:
                         d   1 − 0.002 − 0.85
             ​1 +u r − ​Rd​ ​​ = ____________
       	​π = _                     
                                 ​ 1.05 − 0.85 ​ = 0.74.​
              ​R​ ​− ​R​ ​
      The risk-neutral probability of a down move is therefore 1 – π = 1 – 0.74 =
      0.26. The value of a put option with an exercise price of ¥7,950 is:

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS


The following information relates to questions
1-4
   Privatbank Kleinert KGaA, a private wealth manager in Munich, has a number of
   clients with large holdings in the German fintech firm SparCoin AG. Kleinert’s
   analyst is concerned about a drop in SparCoin’s share price in the next year and
   is recommending to clients that they consider purchasing a one-year put with an
   exercise price of €100. SparCoin’s spot price (S0) is €105.25, and it pays no divi-
   dends. The risk-free rate is 0.37%.

1. Kleinert’s analyst estimates a 50-50 chance that the price of SparCoin will either
   increase by 12% or decline by 10% at the put option’s expiration date. Which of
   the following statements best describes the no-arbitrage option price implied by
   this assumption?
   A. Since there is a 50% chance that the stock will fall to €94.73, there is a 50-50
      chance of a €5.27 payout upon exercise and the no-arbitrage put is therefore
      worth €2.64 (= €5.27 / 2).

   B. Since there is a 50% chance that the stock will fall to €94.73, there is a 50-50
      chance of a €5.27 payout upon exercise and given the risk-neutral probabil-
      ity of 0.47, the no-arbitrage put price is €2.48 (= €5.27 × 0.47).

   C. Since there is a 50% chance that the stock will fall to €94.73 and the
      risk-neutral probability is 0.47, the no-arbitrage put price is €2.78 (= €5.27 ×
      {[1 – 0.47]/1.0037}).

2. If Kleinert’s clients observe that the one-year put option with a €100 exercise
   price is trading at €2.50, which of the following statements best describes how
   Kleinert’s clients could take advantage of this to earn a risk-free return greater
   than 0.37% over the year.
   A. Kleinert should purchase the put option and also purchase approximately
      0.23 shares per option to match the hedge ratio.

   B. Kleinert should purchase the put option and purchase 50% of the under-
      lying shares given the 50-50 chance the stock will fall and the put option
      exercised.

   C. Kleinert should purchase the put option and purchase 47% of the underlying
      shares to match the risk-neutral probability of put exercise.

3. If risk-free investments yielded a higher return over the next year, which of the
   following statements best describes how this would affect the no-arbitrage value
   of the put option on SparCoin shares?
   A. An increase in the risk-free rate will have no effect on SparCoin’s put option
      price, as it is solely a function of the probability and degree of share price
      increase or decrease upon option expiration.
236   Learning Module 10                                    Valuing a Derivative Using a One-Period Binomial Model


                              B. An increase in the risk-free rate will increase the value of the put option, as
                                 it will increase the risk-neutral probability of a price decline.

                              C. An increase in the risk-free rate will decrease the value of the put option,
                                 as it will both increase the risk-neutral probability of a price increase π and
                                 decrease the present value of the expected option payoff.

                           4. If the expected percentage increase and decrease in SparCoin’s share price were
                              to double, which of the following is the closest estimate of the one-year put op-
                              tion price with an exercise price of €100?
                              A. The one-year put option price will rise to €7.90.

                              B. The one-year put option price will rise to €8.50.

                              C. The one-year put option price will rise to €7.40.

   SOLUTIONS
1. The correct answer is C. A 12% increase in the stock price gives:
   	​S1​u​ = ​R​u​​S0​ ​ = 1.12 × €105.25 = €117.88.​
   The put option will expire unexercised:
   	​p​1u​ = Max​(0, X − ​S1​u​)​ = Max​(0, €100 − €117.88)​ = €0.​
   Alternatively, a 10% price decrease gives:

   	​S1​d​ = ​R​d​​S0​ ​ = 0.9 × €105.25 = €94.73.​
   The put option will pay off:

   	​p​1d​ = Max​(1, X − ​S1​d​)​ = Max​(0, €100 − €94.73)​ = €5.27.​
   To price this option, the risk-neutral pricing formula gives the risk-neutral prob-
   ability π as:
   π = (1 + 0.0037 − 0.9)/(1.12 − 0.9) = 0.47.
   The no-arbitrage price is:
            ​(π × ​p​1u​ + (​ 1 − π)​​p​1d​)​
   	​p​0​ = _______________
              
            ​    (​ 1 + r)​ ​

   p0 = (0.47 × €0 + 0.53 × €5.27)/(1 + 0.0037) = €2.79/1.0037 = €2.78.

2. The correct answer is A. If the put option can be purchased for less than the
   no-arbitrage price, then a potential arbitrage opportunity is available. In this case,
   Kleinert’s clients should purchase the underpriced put option and buy h* units of
   SparCoin’s stock. The hedge ratio, h*, is calculated as:
            ​(​p​1u​ − ​p​1d​)​        €0 − €5.27   − €5.27
   	​h​*​ = _
            ​ u d ​ = _____________
                      ​€117.88
                                            _
                               − €94.73 ​ = ​€23.15 ​ = − 0.2276.​
            ​(​S1​ ​ − ​S1​ ​)​

   Note that the negative hedge ratio implies that both the put option and underly-
   ing are purchased or sold to create a hedge. This initial purchase of the put option
   and stock will cost:
   €2.50 + 0.2276 × €105.25 = €26.45.
   Should the stock price decrease, the value of this portfolio will be:

   	​V1​ ​ = ​V1​d​ = ​h​*​​S1​d​ + ​p​1d​ = 0.2276 × €94.73 + €5.27 = €26.83.​
   The strategy generates a risk-free return of (€26.83 – €26.45)/€26.45 = 1.44%,
   which is greater than the 0.37% return on other available risk-free investments.

3. The correct answer is C. Rising interest rates reduce the value of a put option.
   Increasing the risk-free rate will increase the risk-neutral probability of a price
   increase π and decrease the present value of the expected option payoff. Since
   the value of a put option is inversely related to the price of the underlying asset,
   an increased probability of an upward price move will reduce the expected payoff
   from the put. Consequently, both of these effects will reduce the put option value
   as the return on risk-free investments increases.

4. The correct answer is B. A 24% (previously 12%) increase in the stock price gives:

                           	​S1​u​ = ​R​u​​S0​ ​ = 1.24 × €105.25 = €130.51.​
                           The put option will expire unexercised:
                           	​p​1u​ = Max​(0, X − ​S1​u​)​ = Max​(0, €100.00 − €130.51)​ = €0.​
                           Alternatively, a 20% (previously 10%) decrease gives:

                           	​S1​d​ = ​R​d​​S0​ ​ = 0.8 × €105.25 = €84.20.​
                           The put option will pay off:

                           	​p​1d​ = Max​(0, X − ​S1​d​)​ = Max​(0, €100 − €84.20)​ = €15.80.​
                           To price this option, the risk-neutral pricing formula gives the risk-neutral prob-
                           ability as:
                           π = (1 + 0.0037 − 0.8)/(1.24 − 0.8) = 0.46.
                           The no-arbitrage price is:
                                  ​(π × ​p​1u​ + ​(1 − π)​​p​1d​)​
                                    _______________                  (​ 0.46 × €0 + 0.54 × €15.80)​   €8.53
