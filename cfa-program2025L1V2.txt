                                   How to Use the CFA
                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.
       The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam
       registration
    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the

       knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use
       the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
       later review.
           Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
       exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
       and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




       ERRATA
       The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
       reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
       errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
       updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
       error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
       reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

INTRODUCTION
This learning module addresses several important concepts that extend the basic
                                                                                              1
market model of demand and supply to the assessment of a firm’s breakeven and
shutdown points of production. Demand concepts covered include own-price elas-
ticity of demand, cross-price elasticity of demand, and income elasticity of demand.
Supply concepts covered include total, average, and marginal product of labor; total,
variable, and marginal cost of labor; and total and marginal revenue. These concepts
are used to calculate the breakeven and shutdown points of production.

                            This learning module surveys how economists classify market structures. We
                        analyze distinctions between the different structures that are important for under-
                        standing demand and supply relations, optimal price and output, and the factors
                        affecting long-run profitability. We also provide guidelines for identifying market
                        structure in practice.

                           LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                               ■   Firms under conditions of perfect competition have no pricing
                                   power and, therefore, face a perfectly horizontal demand curve
                                   at the market price. For firms under conditions of perfect competition,
                                   price is identical to marginal revenue (MR).
                               ■   Firms under conditions of imperfect competition face a negatively
                                   sloped demand curve and have pricing power. For firms under condi-
                                   tions of imperfect competition, MR is less than price.
                               ■   Economic profit equals total revenue (TR) minus total economic cost,
                                   whereas accounting profit equals TR minus total accounting cost.
                               ■   Economic cost considers the total opportunity cost of all factors of
                                   production.
                               ■   Opportunity cost is the next best alternative use of a resource forgone
                                   in making a decision.
                               ■   Maximum economic profit requires that (1) MR equals marginal cost
                                   (MC) and (2) MC not be falling with output.
                               ■   The breakeven point occurs when TR equals total cost (TC), otherwise
                                   stated as the output quantity at which average total cost (ATC) equals
                                   price.
                               ■   Shutdown occurs when a firm is better off not operating than continu-
                                   ing to operate.
                               ■   If all fixed costs are sunk costs, then shutdown occurs when the
                                   market price falls below the minimum average variable cost. After
                                   shutdown, the firm incurs only fixed costs and loses less money than it
                                   would operating at a price that does not cover variable costs.
                               ■   In the short run, it may be rational for a firm to continue to operate
                                   while earning negative economic profit if some unavoidable fixed costs
                                   are covered.
                               ■   Economies of scale is defined as decreasing long-run cost per unit as
                                   output increases. Diseconomies of scale is defined as increasing long-
                                   run cost per unit as output increases.
                               ■   Long-run ATC is the cost of production per unit of output under con-
                                   ditions in which all inputs are variable.
                               ■   Specialization efficiencies and bargaining power in input price can
                                   lead to economies of scale.
                               ■   Bureaucratic and communication breakdowns and bottlenecks that
                                   raise input prices can lead to diseconomies of scale.
                               ■   The minimum point on the long-run ATC curve defines the minimum
                                   efficient scale for the firm.
                               ■   Economic market structures can be grouped into four categories: per-
                                   fect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.

Introduction                                                                          5


      ■   The categories of economic market structures differ because of the
          following characteristics: The number of producers is many in perfect
          and monopolistic competition, few in oligopoly, and one in monopoly.
          The degree of product differentiation, the pricing power of the pro-
          ducer, the barriers to entry of new producers, and the level of non-
          price competition (e.g., advertising) are all low in perfect competition,
          moderate in monopolistic competition, high in oligopoly, and gener-
          ally highest in monopoly.
      ■   A financial analyst must understand the characteristics of market
          structures to better forecast a firm’s future profit stream.
      ■   The optimal MR equals MC. Only in perfect competition, however,
          does the MR equal price. In the remaining structures, price generally
          exceeds MR because a firm can sell more units only by reducing the
          per unit price.
      ■   The quantity sold is highest in perfect competition. The price in
          perfect competition is usually lowest, but this depends on factors
          such as demand elasticity and increasing returns to scale (which may
          reduce the producer’s MC). Monopolists, oligopolists, and producers
          in monopolistic competition attempt to differentiate their products so
          that they can charge higher prices.
      ■   Typically, monopolists sell a smaller quantity at a higher price.
          Investors may benefit from being shareholders of monopolistic firms
          that have large margins and substantial positive cash flows.
      ■   In perfect competition, firms do not earn economic profit. The market
          will compensate for the rental of capital and of management ser-
          vices, but the lack of pricing power implies that there will be no extra
          margins.
      ■   In the short run, firms in any market structure can have economic
          profits, the more competitive a market is and the lower the barriers
          to entry, the faster the extra profits will fade. In the long run, new
          entrants shrink margins and push the least efficient firms out of the
          market.
      ■   Oligopoly is characterized by the importance of strategic behavior.
          Firms can change the price, quantity, quality, and advertisement of the
          product to gain an advantage over their competitors. Several types of
          equilibrium (e.g., Nash, Cournot, kinked demand curve) may occur
          that affect the likelihood of each of the incumbents (and potential
          entrants in the long run) having economic profits. Price wars may be
          started to force weaker competitors to abandon the market.
      ■   Measuring market power is complicated. Ideally, econometric esti-
          mates of the elasticity of demand and supply should be computed.
          However, because of the lack of reliable data and the fact that elastic-
          ity changes over time (so that past data may not apply to the current
          situation), regulators and economists often use simpler measures. The
          concentration ratio is simple, but the Herfindahl-Hirschman index
          (HHI), with a little more computation required, often produces a bet-
          ter figure for decision making.

            2           PROFIT MAXIMIZATION: PRODUCTION BREAKEVEN,
                        SHUTDOWN AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE

                                      determine and interpret breakeven and shutdown points of
                                      production, as well as how economies and diseconomies of scale
                                      affect costs under perfect and imperfect competition

                        Firms generally can be classified as operating in either a perfectly competitive or an
                        imperfectly competitive environment. The difference between the two manifests in the
                        slope of the demand curve facing the firm. If the environment of the firm is perfectly
                        competitive, it must take the market price of its output as given, so it faces a perfectly
                        elastic, horizontal demand curve. In this case, the firm’s marginal revenue (MR) and
                        the price of its product are identical. Additionally, the firm’s average revenue (AR),
                        or revenue per unit, is also equal to price per unit. A firm that faces a negatively
                        sloped demand curve, however, must lower its price to sell an additional unit, so its
                        MR is less than price (P).
                            These characteristics of MR are also applicable to the total revenue (TR) func-
                        tions. Under conditions of perfect competition, TR (as always) is equal to price times
                        quantity: TR = (P)(Q). But under conditions of perfect competition, price is dictated
                        by the market; the firm has no control over price. As the firm sells one more unit, its
                        TR rises by the exact amount of price per unit.
                            Under conditions of imperfect competition, price is a variable under the firm’s
                        control, and therefore price is a function of quantity: P = f(Q), and TR = f(Q) × Q.
                        For simplicity, suppose the firm is monopolistic and faces the market demand curve,
                        which we will assume is linear and negatively sloped. Because the monopolist is the
                        only seller, its TR is identical to the total expenditure of all buyers in the market. When
                        price is reduced and quantity sold increases in this environment, a decrease in price
                        initially increases total expenditure by buyers and TR to the firm because the decrease
                        in price is outweighed by the increase in units sold. But as price continues to fall, the
                        decrease in price overshadows the increase in quantity, and total expenditure (revenue)
                        falls. We can now depict the demand and TR functions for firms under conditions of
                        perfect and imperfect competition, as shown in Exhibit 1.

Panel A of Exhibit 1 depicts the demand curve (upper graph) and total revenue curve
(lower graph) for the firm under conditions of perfect competition. Notice that the
vertical axis in the upper graph is price per unit (e.g., GBP/bushel), whereas TR is
measured on the vertical axis in the lower graph (e.g., GBP/week). The same is true
for the respective axes in Panel B, which depicts the demand and total revenue curves
for the monopolist. The TR curve for the firm under conditions of perfect competition
is linear, with a slope equal to price per unit. The TR curve for the monopolist first
rises (in the range where MR is positive and demand is elastic) and then falls (in the
range where MR is negative and demand is inelastic) with output.


Profit-Maximization, Breakeven, and Shutdown Points of

We can now combine the firm’s short-run TC curves with its TR curves to represent
profit maximization in the cases of perfect competition and imperfect competition.
Exhibit 2 shows both the AR and average cost curves in one graph for the firm under
conditions of perfect competition.

                        The firm is maximizing profit by producing Q*, where price is equal to short-run
                        marginal cost (SMC) and SMC is rising. Note at another output level, Q′, where P =
                        SMC, SMC is still falling, so this cannot be a profit-maximizing solution. If market
                        price were to rise, the firm’s demand and MR curve would simply shift upward, and the
                        firm would reach a new profit-maximizing output level to the right of Q*. If, however,
                        market price were to fall, the firm’s demand and MR curve would shift downward,
                        resulting in a new and lower level of profit-maximizing output. As depicted, this firm
                        is currently earning a positive economic profit because market price exceeds average
                        total cost (ATC), at output level Q*. This profit is possible in the short run, but in the
                        long run, competitors would enter the market to capture some of those profits and
                        would drive the market price down to a level equal to each firm’s ATC.
                            Exhibit 3 depicts the cost and revenue curves for the monopolist that is facing a
                        negatively sloped market demand curve. The MR and demand curves are not identical
                        for this firm. But the profit-maximizing rule is still the same: Find the level of Q that
                        equates SMC, to MR—in this case, Q*. Once that level of output is determined, the
                        optimal price to charge is given by the firm’s demand curve at P*. This monopolist is
                        earning positive economic profit because its price exceeds its ATC. The barriers to
                        entry that give this firm its monopolistic power mean that outside competitors would
                        not be able to compete away this firm’s profits.

Profit Maximization: Production Breakeven, Shutdown and Economies of Scale                   9



Breakeven Analysis and Shutdown Decision
A firm is said to break even if its TR is equal to its TC. It also can be said that a firm
breaks even if its price (AR) is exactly equal to its ATC, which is true under conditions
of perfect and imperfect competition. Of course, the goal of management is not just
to breakeven but to maximize profit. However, perhaps the best the firm can do is
cover all of its economic costs. Economic costs are the sum of total accounting costs
and implicit opportunity costs. A firm whose revenue is equal to its economic costs
is covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors of production, including capital.
Economists would say that such a firm is earning normal profit, but not positive eco-
nomic profit. It is earning a rate of return on capital just equal to the rate of return
that an investor could expect to earn in an equivalently risky alternative investment
(opportunity cost). Firms that are operating in a competitive environment with no
barriers to entry from other competitors can expect, in the long run, to be unable to
earn a positive economic profit; the excess rate of return would attract entrants who
would produce more output and ultimately drive the market price down to the level
at which each firm is, at best, just earning a normal profit. This situation, of course,
does not imply that the firm is earning zero accounting profit.
    Exhibit 4 depicts the condition for both a firm under conditions of perfect com-
petition (Panel A) and a monopolist (Panel B) in which the best each firm can do is
to break even. Note that at the level of output at which SMC is equal to MR, price is
equal to ATC. Hence, economic profit is zero, and the firms are breaking even.

                         The Shutdown Decision
                         In the long run, if a firm cannot earn at least a zero economic profit, it will not operate
                         because it is not covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors of production, labor,
                         and capital. In the short run, however, a firm might find it advantageous to continue
                         to operate even if it is not earning at least a zero economic profit. The discussion that
                         follows addresses the decision to continue to operate and earn negative profit or shut
                         down operations.
                             Recall that typically some or all of a firm’s fixed costs are incurred regardless of
                         whether the firm operates. The firm might have a lease on its building that it cannot
                         avoid paying until the lease expires. In that case, the lease payment is a sunk cost: It
                         cannot be avoided, no matter what the firm does. Sunk costs must be ignored in the
                         decision to continue to operate in the short run. As long as the firm’s revenues cover

at least its variable cost, the firm is better off continuing to operate. If price is greater
than average variable cost (AVC), the firm is covering not only all of its variable cost
but also a portion of fixed cost.
    In the long run, unless market price increases, this firm would exit the industry.
But in the short run, it will continue to operate at a loss. Exhibit 5 depicts a firm under
conditions of perfect competition facing three alternative market price ranges for its
output. At any price above P1, the firm can earn a positive profit and clearly should
continue to operate. At a price below P2, the minimum AVC, the firm could not even
cover its variable cost and should shut down. At prices between P2 and P1, the firm
should continue to operate in the short run because it is able to cover all of its variable
cost and contribute something toward its unavoidable fixed costs. Economists refer
to the minimum AVC point as the shutdown point and the minimum ATC point as
the breakeven point.

                               Solution:
                               WR International will initially break even at 40 units of production, where
                               TR and TC equal 360,000.

                            2. Where is the region of profitability?
                               Solution:
                               The region of profitability will range from greater than 40 units to less than
                               80 units. Any production quantity of less than 40 units and any quantity
                               greater than 80 units will result in an economic loss.

                            3. At what point will the firm maximize profit? At what points are there eco-
                               nomic losses?
                               Solution:
                               Maximum profit of 30,000 will occur at 60 units. Lower profit will occur
                               at any output level that is higher or lower than 60 units. From 0 units to
                               less than 40 units and for quantities greater than 80 units, economic losses
                               occur.

                             Given the relationships between TR, total variable costs (TVC), and total fixed
                         costs (TFC), Exhibit 7 summarizes the decisions to operate, shut down production,
                         or exit the market in both the short run and the long run. The firm must cover its
                         variable cost to remain in business in the short run; if TR cannot cover TVC, the firm
                         shuts down production to minimize loss. The loss would be equal to the amount of
                         fixed cost. If TVC exceeds TR in the long run, the firm will exit the market to avoid
                         the loss associated with fixed cost at zero production. By exiting the market, the firm’s
                         investors do not suffer the erosion of their equity capital from economic losses. When
                         TR is enough to cover TVC but not all of TFC, the firm can continue to produce in
                         the short run but will not be able to maintain financial solvency in the long run.

EXAMPLE 2

  Shutdown Analysis
  For the most recent financial reporting period, a London-based business has
  revenue of GBP2 million and TC of GBP2.5 million, which are or can be broken
  down into TFC of GBP1 million and TVC of GBP1.5 million. The net loss on the
  firm’s income statement is reported as GBP500,000 (ignoring tax implications).
  In prior periods, the firm had reported profits on its operations.

  1. What decision should the firm make regarding operations over the short
     term?
     Solution:
     In the short run, the firm is able to cover all of its TVC but only half of its
     GBP1 million in TFC. If the business ceases to operate, its loss would be
     GBP1 million, the amount of TFC, whereas the net loss by operating would
     be minimized at GBP500,000. The firm should attempt to operate by nego-
     tiating special arrangements with creditors to buy time to return operations
     back to profitability.

  2. What decision should the firm make regarding operations over the long
     term?
     Solution:
     If the revenue shortfall is expected to persist over time, the firm should
     cease operations, liquidate assets, and pay debts to the extent possible. Any
     residual for shareholders would decrease the longer the firm is allowed to
     operate unprofitably.

  3. Assume the same business scenario except that revenue is now GBP1.3 mil-
     lion, which creates a net loss of GBP1.2 million. What decision should the
     firm make regarding operations in this case?
     Solution:
     The firm would minimize loss at GBP1 million of TFC by shutting down.
     If the firm decided to continue to do business, the loss would increase to

                         enters or leaves the production range for profitability and at which the firm can no
                         longer function as a viable business entity provides invaluable insight when making
                         investment decisions.


                         Economies and Diseconomies of Scale with Short-Run and
                         Long-Run Cost Analysis
                         Rational behavior dictates that the firm select an operating size or scale that maxi-
                         mizes profit over any time frame. The time frame that defines the short run and long
                         run for any firm is based on the ability of the firm to adjust the quantities of the fixed
                         resources it uses. The short run is the time period during which at least one of the
                         factors of production, such as technology, physical capital, and plant size, is fixed.
                         The long run is defined as the time period during which all factors of production are
                         variable. Additionally, in the long run, firms can enter or exit the market based on
                         decisions regarding profitability. The long run is often referred to as the “planning
                         horizon” in which the firm can choose the short-run position or optimal operating
                         size that maximizes profit over time. The firm is always operating in the short run
                         but planning in the long run.
                             The time required for long-run adjustments varies by industry. For example, the
                         long run for a small business using very little technology and physical capital may be
                         less than a year, whereas for a capital-intensive firm, the long run may be more than a
                         decade. Given enough time, however, all production factors are variable, which allows
                         the firm to choose an operating size or plant capacity based on different technologies
                         and physical capital. In this regard, costs and profits will differ between the short run
                         and the long run.

                         Short- and Long-Run Cost Curves
                         Recall that when we addressed the short-run cost curves of the firm, we assumed that
                         the capital input was held constant. That meant that the only way to vary output in
                         the short run was to change the level of the variable input—in our case, labor. If the
                         capital input—namely, plant and equipment—were to change, however, we would
                         have an entirely new set of short-run cost curves, one for each level of capital input.
                             The short-run total cost includes all the inputs—labor and capital—the firm is
                         using to produce output. For reasons discussed earlier, the typical short-run total cost
                         (STC) curve might rise with output, first at a decreasing rate because of specialization
                         economies and then at an increasing rate, reflecting the law of diminishing marginal
                         returns to labor. TFC, the quantity of capital input multiplied by the rental rate on
                         capital, determines the vertical intercept of the STC curve. At higher levels of fixed
                         input, TFC is greater, but the production capacity of the firm is also greater. Exhibit
                         8 shows three different STC curves for the same technology but using three distinct
                         levels of capital input—points 1, 2, and 3 on the vertical axis.

Plant Size 1 is the smallest and, of course, has the lowest fixed cost; hence, its STC1
curve has the lowest vertical intercept. Note that STC1 begins to rise more steeply
with output, reflecting the lower plant capacity. Plant Size 3 is the largest of the three
and reflects that size with both a higher fixed cost and a lower slope at any level of
output. If a firm decided to produce an output between zero and Qa, it would plan
on building Plant Size 1 because for any output level in that range, its cost would be
less than it would be for Plant Size 2 or 3. Accordingly, if the firm were planning to
produce output greater than Qb, it would choose Plant Size 3 because its cost for any of
those levels of output would be lower than it would be for Plant Size 1 or 2. Of course,
Plant Size 2 would be chosen for output levels between Qa and Qb. The long-run total
cost curve is derived from the lowest level of STC for each level of output because
in the long run, the firm is free to choose which plant size it will operate. This curve
is called an “envelope curve.” In essence, this curve envelopes—encompasses—all
possible combinations of technology, plant size, and physical capital.
    For each STC curve, there is also a corresponding short-run average total cost
(SATC) curve and a corresponding long-run average total cost (LRAC) curve, the
envelope curve of all possible short-run average total cost curves. The shape of the
LRAC curve reflects an important concept called economies of scale and disecon-
omies of scale.

Defining Economies of Scale and Diseconomies of Scale
When a firm increases all of its inputs to increase its level of output (obviously, a
long-run concept), it is said to scale up its production. Scaling down is the reverse—
decreasing all of its inputs to produce less in the long run. Economies of scale occur
if, as the firm increases its output, cost per unit of production falls. Graphically, this
definition translates into an LRAC curve with a negative slope. Exhibit 9 depicts several
SATC curves, one for each plant size, and the LRAC curve representing economies
of scale.

                         As the firm grows in size, economies of scale and a lower ATC can result from the
                         following factors:
                             ■   Achieving increasing returns to scale when a production process allows
                                 for increases in output that are proportionately larger than the increase in
                                 inputs.
                             ■   Having a division of labor and management in a large firm with numerous
                                 workers, which allows each worker to specialize in one task rather than
                                 perform many duties, as in the case of a small business (as such, workers in
                                 a large firm become more proficient at their jobs).
                             ■   Being able to afford more expensive, yet more efficient equipment and to
                                 adapt the latest in technology that increases productivity.
                             ■   Effectively reducing waste and lowering costs through marketable
                                 by-products, less energy consumption, and enhanced quality control.
                             ■   Making better use of market information and knowledge for more effective
                                 managerial decision making.

Profit Maximization: Production Breakeven, Shutdown and Economies of Scale                   17


    ■   Obtaining discounted prices on resources when buying in larger quantities.
     A classic example of a business that realizes economies of scale through greater
physical capital investment is an electric utility. By expanding output capacity to
accommodate a larger customer base, the utility company’s per-unit cost will decline.
Economies of scale help explain why electric utilities have naturally evolved from
localized entities to regional and multiregional enterprises. Walmart is an example
of a business that has used its bulk purchasing power to obtain deep discounts from
suppliers to keep costs and prices low. Walmart also uses the latest technology to
monitor point-of-sale transactions to gather timely market information to respond
to changes in customer buying behavior, which leads to economies of scale through
lower distribution and inventory costs.
     Factors that can lead to diseconomies of scale, inefficiencies, and rising costs when
a firm increases in size include the following:
    ■   Realizing decreasing returns to scale when a production process leads to
        increases in output that are proportionately smaller than the increase in
        inputs.
    ■   Being so large that it cannot be properly managed.
    ■   Overlapping and duplicating business functions and product lines.[
    ■   Experiencing higher resource prices because of supply constraints when
        buying inputs in large quantities.
    Before its restructuring, General Motors (GM) was an example of a business that
had realized diseconomies of scale by becoming too large. Scale diseconomies occurred
through product overlap and duplication (i.e., similar or identical automobile models),
and the fixed cost for these models was not spread over a large volume of output. In
2009, GM decided to discontinue three brands (Saturn, Pontiac, and Hummer) and
also to drop various low-volume product models that overlapped with others. GM
had numerous manufacturing plants around the world and sold vehicles in more
than a hundred countries. Given this geographic dispersion in production and sales,
the company had communication and management coordination problems, which
resulted in higher costs. In 2017, GM sold its European arm, Opel, to Groupe PSA,
the maker of Peugeot and Citroën. GM also had significantly higher labor costs than
its competitors. As the largest producer in the market, it had been a target of labor
unions for higher compensation and benefits packages relative to other firms.
    Economies and diseconomies of scale can occur at the same time; the impact on
LRAC depends on which dominates. If economies of scale dominate, LRAC decreases
with increases in output. The reverse holds true when diseconomies of scale prevail.
LRAC may fall (economies of scale) over a range of output and then LRAC might
remain constant over another range, which could be followed by a range over which
diseconomies of scale prevail, as depicted in Exhibit 11.
    The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient
scale. The minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition
over the long run. Theoretically, perfect competition forces the firm to operate at the
minimum point on the LRAC curve because the market price will be established at
this level over the long run. If the firm is not operating at this least-cost point, its
long-term viability will be threatened.

                               position places the US firms at a cost—and possibly, pricing—disadvantage

                               foreign competitors. Second, only Rocket operates at the minimum point of
                               the LRACUS, whereas GenAuto is situated in the region of diseconomies of
                               scale and Starr is positioned in the economies of scale portion of the curve.
                               To become more efficient and competitive, GenAuto needs to downsize
                               and restructure, which means moving down the LRACUS curve to a smaller

     yet lower-cost production volume. In contrast, Starr has to grow in size to
     become more efficient and competitive by lowering per-unit costs.
     From a long-term investment prospective and given its cost advantage,
     Rocket has the potential to create more investment value relative to GenAu-
     to and Starr. Over the long run, if GenAuto and Starr can lower their ATC,
     they will become more attractive to investors. But if any of the three US
     auto companies cannot match the cost competitiveness of the foreign firms,
     they may be driven from the market. In the long run, the lower-cost foreign
     automakers pose a severe competitive challenge to the survival of the US
     manufacturers and their ability to maintain and grow shareholders’ wealth.



QUESTION SET


  1. An agricultural firm operating in a perfectly competitive market
     supplies wheat to manufacturers of consumer food products and animal
     feeds. If the firm were able to expand its production and unit sales by 10%,
     the most likely result would be:
      A. a 10% increase in total revenue.
      B. a 10% increase in average revenue.
      C. a less than 10% increase in total revenue.
     Solution:
     A is correct. In a perfectly competitive market, an increase in supply by a
     single firm will not affect price. Therefore, an increase in units sold by the
     firm will be matched proportionately by an increase in revenue.

  2. The marginal revenue per unit sold for a firm doing business under condi-
     tions of perfect competition will most likely be:
      A. equal to average revenue.
      B. less than average revenue.
      C. greater than average revenue.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Under perfect competition, a firm is a price taker at any quanti-
     ty supplied to the market, and AR = MR = Price.

  3. A profit maximum is least likely to occur when:
      A. average total cost is minimized.
      B. marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.
      C. the difference between total revenue and total cost is maximized.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The quantity at which average total cost is minimized does not
     necessarily correspond to a profit maximum.

  4. The short-term breakeven point of production for a firm operating under
     perfect competition will most likely occur when:
      A. price is equal to average total cost.
      B. marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.

                                C. marginal revenue is equal to average variable costs.
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Under perfect competition, price is equal to marginal revenue.
                               A firm breaks even when marginal revenue equals average total cost.




             3           INTRODUCTION TO MARKET STRUCTURES

                                       describe characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic
                                       competition, oligopoly, and pure monopoly

                         Different market structures result in different sets of choices facing a firm’s decision
                         makers. Thus, an understanding of market structure is a powerful tool in analyzing
                         issues, such as a firm’s pricing of its products and, more broadly, its potential to
                         increase profitability. In the long run, a firm’s profitability will be determined by the
                         forces associated with the market structure within which it operates. In a highly
                         competitive market, long-run profits will be driven down by the forces of competi-
                         tion. In less competitive markets, large profits are possible even in the long run; in
                         the short run, any outcome is possible. Therefore, understanding the forces behind
                         the market structure will aid the financial analyst in determining firms’ short- and
                         long-term prospects.
                             Market structures address questions such as the following: What determines the
                         degree of competition associated with each market structure? Given the degree of
                         competition associated with each market structure, what decisions are left to the
                         management team developing corporate strategy? How does a chosen pricing and
                         output strategy evolve into specific decisions that affect the profitability of the firm?
                         The answers to these questions are related to the forces of the market structure within
                         which the firm operates.


                         Analysis of Market Structures
                         Traditionally, economists classify a market into one of four structures: perfect com-
                         petition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
                             Economists define a market as a group of buyers and sellers that are aware of each
                         other and can agree on a price for the exchange of goods and services. Although internet
                         access has extended a number of markets worldwide, certain markets remain limited
                         by geographic boundaries. For example, the internet search engine Google operates
                         in a worldwide market. In contrast, the market for premixed cement is limited to the
                         area within which a truck can deliver the mushy mix from the plant to a construction
                         site before the compound becomes useless. Thomas L. Friedman’s international best
                         seller The World Is Flat challenges the concept of the geographic limitations of the
                         market. If the service being provided by the seller can be digitized, its market expands
                         worldwide. For example, a technician can scan your injury in a clinic in Switzerland.
                         That radiographic image can be digitized and sent to a radiologist in India to be read.
                         As a customer (i.e., patient), you may never know that part of the medical service
                         provided to you was the result of a worldwide market.
                             Some markets are highly concentrated, with the majority of total sales coming
                         from a small number of firms. For example, in the market for internet search, three
                         firms controlled 98.9 percent of the US market (Google 63.5 percent, Microsoft 24
                         percent, and Oath (formerly Yahoo!) 11.4 percent) as of January 2018. Other markets

are fragmented, such as automobile repairs, in which small independent shops often
dominate and large chains may or may not exist. New products can lead to market
concentration. For example, Apple introduced its first digital audio player (iPod) in
2001 and despite the entry of competitors had a world market share of more than 70
percent among digital audio players in 2009.

THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKET STRUCTURE

   Consider the evolution of television broadcasting. As the market environment
   for television broadcasting evolved, the market structure changed, resulting
   in a new set of challenges and choices. In the early days, viewers had only one
   choice: the “free” analog channels that were broadcast over the airwaves. Most
   countries had one channel, owned and run by the government. In the United
   States, some of the more populated markets were able to receive more chan-
   nels because local channels were set up to cover a market with more potential
   viewers. By the 1970s, new technologies made it possible to broadcast by way of
   cable connectivity and the choices offered to consumers began to expand rap-
   idly. Cable television challenged the “free” broadcast channels by offering more
   choice and a better-quality picture. The innovation was expensive for consumers
   and profitable for the cable companies. By the 1990s, a new alternative began to
   challenge the existing broadcast and cable systems: satellite television. Satellite
   providers offered a further expanded set of choices, albeit at a higher price, than
   the free broadcast and cable alternatives. In the early 2000s, satellite television
   providers lowered their pricing to compete directly with the cable providers.
       Today, cable program providers, satellite television providers, and terrestrial
   digital broadcasters that offer premium and pay-per-view channels compete for
   customers who are increasingly finding content on the internet and on their
   mobile devices. Companies like Netflix, Apple, and Amazon offered alternative
   ways for consumers to access content. Over time, these companies had moved
   beyond the repackaging of existing shows to developing their own content, mir-
   roring the evolution of cable channels, such as HBO and ESPN a decade earlier.
       This is a simple illustration of the importance of market structure. As the
   market for television broadcasting became increasingly competitive, managers
   have had to make decisions regarding product packaging, pricing, advertising,
   and marketing to survive in the changing environment. In addition, mergers
   and acquisitions as a response to these competitive pressures have changed the
   essential structure of the industry.

     Market structure can be broken down into four distinct categories: perfect com-
petition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly.
     We start with the most competitive environment, perfect competition. Unlike
some economic concepts, perfect competition is not merely an ideal based on assump-
tions. Perfect competition is a reality—for example, in several commodities markets, in
which sellers and buyers have a strictly homogeneous product and no single producer
is large enough to influence market prices. Perfect competition’s characteristics are well
recognized and its long-run outcome is unavoidable. Profits under the conditions of
perfect competition are driven to the required rate of return paid by the entrepreneur
to borrow capital from investors (so-called normal profit or rental cost of capital). This
does not mean that all perfectly competitive industries are doomed to extinction by
a lack of profits. On the contrary, millions of businesses that do very well are living
under the pressures of perfect competition.
     Monopolistic competition is also highly competitive; however, it is considered
a form of imperfect competition. Two economists, Edward H. Chamberlin (United
States) and Joan Robinson (United Kingdom), identified this hybrid market and came

22   Learning Module 1                                                         The Firm and Market Structures


                         up with the term because this market structure not only has strong elements of com-
                         petition but also some monopoly-like conditions. The competitive characteristic is
                         a notably large number of firms, while the monopoly aspect is the result of product
                         differentiation. That is, if the seller can convince consumers that its product is uniquely
                         different from other, similar products, then the seller can exercise some degree of
                         pricing power over the market. A good example is the brand loyalty associated with
                         soft drinks such as Coca-Cola. Many of Coca-Cola’s customers believe that their
                         beverages are truly different from and better than all other soft drinks. The same is
                         true for fashion creations and cosmetics.
                             The oligopoly market structure is based on a relatively small number of firms
                         supplying the market. The small number of firms in the market means that each firm
                         must consider what retaliatory strategies the other firms will pursue when prices and
                         production levels change. Consider the pricing behavior of commercial airline com-
                         panies. Pricing strategies and route scheduling are based on the expected reaction of
                         the other carriers in similar markets. For any given route—say, from Paris, France, to
                         Chennai, India—only a few carriers are in competition. If one of the carriers changes
                         its pricing package, others likely will retaliate. Understanding the market structure
                         of oligopoly markets can help identify a logical pattern of strategic price changes for
                         the competing firms.
                             Finally, the least competitive market structure is the monopoly. In pure monopoly
                         markets, no other good substitutes exist for the given product or service. A single
                         seller, which, if allowed to operate without constraint, exercises considerable power
                         over pricing and output decisions. In most market-based economies around the globe,
                         pure monopolies are regulated by a governmental authority. The most common exam-
                         ple of a regulated monopoly is the local electrical power provider. In most cases, the
                         monopoly power provider is allowed to earn a normal return on its investment and
                         prices are set by the regulatory authority to allow that return.

                         Factors That Determine Market Structure
                         The following five factors determine market structure:
                             1. The number and relative size of firms supplying the product;
                             2. The degree of product differentiation;
                             3. The power of the seller over pricing decisions;
                             4. The relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit; and
                             5. The degree of non-price competition.
                             The number and relative size of firms in a market influence market structure. When
                         many firms exist, the degree of competition increases. With fewer firms supplying
                         a good or service, consumers are limited in their market choices. One extreme case
                         is the monopoly market structure, with only one firm supplying a unique good or
                         service. Another extreme is perfect competition, with many firms supplying a similar
                         product. Finally, an example of relative size is the automobile industry, in which a
                         small number of large international producers (e.g., Volkswagen and Toyota) are the
                         leaders in the global market, and a number of small companies either have market
                         power because they are niche players (e.g., Ferrari or McLaren) or have limited mar-
                         ket power because of their narrow range of models or limited geographical presence
                         (e.g., Mazda or Stellantis).
                             In the case of monopolistic competition, many firms are providing products to the
                         market, as with perfect competition. However, one firm’s product is differentiated in
                         some way that makes it appear to be better than similar products from other firms.
                         If a firm is successful in differentiating its product, this differentiation will provide
                         pricing leverage. The more dissimilar the product appears, the more the market will

Introduction to Market Structures                                                                                        23


resemble the monopoly market structure. A firm can differentiate its product through
aggressive advertising campaigns; frequent styling changes; the linking of its product
with other complementary products; or a host of other methods.
    When the market dictates the price based on aggregate supply and demand con-
ditions, the individual firm has no control over pricing. The typical hog farmer in
Nebraska and the milk producer in Bavaria are price takers. That is, they must accept
whatever price the market dictates. This is the case under the market structure of
perfect competition. In the case of monopolistic competition, the success of product
differentiation determines the degree with which the firm can influence price. In the
case of oligopoly, there are so few firms in the market that price control becomes
possible. However, the small number of firms in an oligopoly market invites complex
pricing strategies. Collusion, price leadership by dominant firms, and other pricing
strategies can result.
    The degree to which one market structure can evolve into another and the dif-
ference between potential short-run outcomes and long-run equilibrium conditions
depend on the strength of the barriers to entry and the possibility that firms fail to
recoup their original costs or lose money for an extended period of time and there-
fore are forced to exit the market. Barriers to entry can result from large capital
investment requirements, as in the case of petroleum refining. Barriers may also
result from patents, as in the case of some electronic products and drug formulas.
Another entry consideration is the possibility of high exit costs. For example, plants
that are specific to a special line of products, such as aluminum smelting plants, are
non-redeployable, and exit costs would be high without a liquid market for the firm’s
assets. High exit costs deter entry and therefore also are considered barriers to entry.
In the case of farming, the barriers to entry are low. Production of corn, soybeans,
wheat, tomatoes, and other produce is an easy process to replicate; therefore, those
are highly competitive markets.
    Non-price competition dominates those market structures in which product
differentiation is critical. Therefore, monopolistic competition relies on competitive
strategies that may not include pricing changes. An example of non-price competi-
tion is product differentiation through marketing. In other circumstances, non-price
competition may occur because the few firms in the market feel dependent on each
other. Each firm fears retaliatory price changes that would reduce total revenue for
all of the firms in the market. Because oligopoly industries have so few firms, each
firm feels dependent on the pricing strategies of the others. Therefore, non-price
competition becomes a dominant strategy.

                         From the perspective of the owners of the firm, the most desirable market structure
                         is that with the most control over price, because this control can lead to large profits
                         (Exhibit 13). Monopoly and oligopoly markets offer the greatest potential control over
                         price; monopolistic competition offers less control. Firms operating under perfectly
                         competitive market conditions have no control over price. From the consumers’
                         perspective, the most desirable market structure is that with the greatest degree of
                         competition because prices are generally lower. Thus, consumers would prefer as many
                         goods and services as possible to be offered in competitive markets.
                             As often happens in economics, there is a trade-off. While perfect competition
                         gives the largest quantity of a good at the lowest price, other market forms may spur
                         more innovation. Specifically, firms may incur high costs in researching a new prod-
                         uct, and they will incur such costs only if they expect to earn an attractive return on
                         their research investment. This is the case often made for medical innovations, for
                         example—the cost of clinical trials and experiments to create new medicines would
                         bankrupt perfectly competitive firms but may be acceptable in an oligopoly market
                         structure. Therefore, consumers can benefit from less-than-perfectly-competitive
                         markets.

                          PORTER’S FIVE FORCES AND MARKET STRUCTURE

                            A financial analyst aiming to establish market conditions and consequent prof-
                            itability of incumbent firms should start with the questions posed earlier: How
                            many sellers are there? Is the product differentiated? Moreover, in the case of
                            monopolies and quasi-monopolies, the analyst should evaluate the legislative and
                            regulatory framework: Can the company set prices freely, or are there govern-
                            mental controls? Finally, the analyst should consider the threat of competition
                            from potential entrants.
                                This analysis is often summarized by students of corporate strategy as “Porter’s
                            five forces,” named after Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter.
                            His book, Competitive Strategy, presented a systematic analysis of the practice
                            of market strategy. Porter identified the five forces as follows:
                                ■   Threat of entry;
                                ■   Power of suppliers;
                                ■   Power of buyers (customers);
                                ■   Threat of substitutes; and
                                ■   Rivalry among existing competitors.
                                It is easy to note the parallels between four of these five forces and the
                            questions posed earlier. The only “orphan” is the power of suppliers, which is
                            not at the core of the theoretical economic analysis of competition, but which
                            has substantial weight in the practical analysis of competition and profitability.
                                Some stock analysts use the term “economic moat” to suggest that some of
                            the factors protecting the profitability of a firm are similar to the moats (ditches
                            full of water) that were used to protect some medieval castles. A deep moat
                            means that there is little or no threat of entry by invaders (i.e., competitors). It
                            also means that customers are locked in because of high switching costs.

QUESTION SET


   1. A market structure characterized by many sellers with each having
      some pricing power and product differentiation is best described as:
      A. oligopoly.
      B. perfect competition.
       C. monopolistic competition.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Monopolistic competition is characterized by many sellers,
      differentiated products, and some pricing power.

   2. A market structure with relatively few sellers of a homogeneous or stan-
      dardized product is best described as:
      A. oligopoly.
      B. monopoly.
       C. perfect competition.
      Solution:
      A is correct. Few sellers of a homogeneous or standardized product charac-
      terizes an oligopoly.




MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
                                                                                            4
              explain supply and demand relationships under monopolistic
              competition, including the optimal price and output for firms as well
              as pricing strategy

Many market structures exhibit characteristics of strong competitive forces; however,
other distinct non-competitive factors can also play important roles in the market. As
the name implies, monopolistic competition is a hybrid market. The most distinctive
factor in monopolistic competition is product differentiation. Recall the characteristics
outlined earlier:
   1. The market has a large number of potential buyers and sellers.
   2. The products offered by each seller are close substitutes for the products
      offered by other firms, and each firm tries to make its product look different.
   3. Entry into and exit from the market are possible with fairly low costs.
   4. Firms have some pricing power.
   5. Suppliers differentiate their products through advertising and other non-
      price strategies.
    While the market is made up of many firms that compose the product group, each
producer attempts to distinguish its product from that of the others. Product differ-
entiation is accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, consider the wide variety
of communication devices available today. Decades ago, when each communication

                         market was controlled by a regulated single seller (the telephone company), all tele-
                         phones were alike. In today’s deregulated market, the variety of physical styles and
                         colors is extensive. All versions accomplish many of the same tasks.
                             The communication device manufacturers and providers differentiate their products
                         with different colors, styles, networks, bundled applications, conditional contracts,
                         functionality, and more. Advertising is usually the avenue pursued to convince con-
                         sumers that the goods in the product group are different. Successful advertising and
                         trademark branding result in customer loyalty. A good example is the brand loyalty
                         associated with Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley-Davidson’s customers believe
                         that their motorcycles are truly different from and better than all other motorcycles.
                             The extent to which the producer is successful in product differentiation deter-
                         mines pricing power in the market. Very successful differentiation results in a market
                         structure that resembles the single-seller market (monopoly). Because of relatively
                         low entry and exit costs, competition will, in the long run, drive prices and revenues
                         down toward an equilibrium similar to perfect competition. Thus, the hybrid market
                         displays characteristics found in both perfectly competitive and monopoly markets.


                         Demand Analysis in Monopolistically Competitive Markets
                         Because each good sold in the product group is somewhat different from the others,
                         the demand curve for each firm in the monopolistic competition market structure is
                         downward sloping to the right. Price and the quantity demanded are negatively related.
                         Lowering the price will increase the quantity demanded and raising the price will
                         decrease the quantity demanded. There will be ranges of prices within which demand
                         is elastic and (lower) prices at which demand is inelastic. Exhibit 14 illustrates the
                         demand, marginal revenue, and cost structures facing a monopolistically competitive
                         firm in the short run.

                         can charge the price determined by the demand curve. Therefore, in Exhibit 14, Q1
                         is the ideal level of output and P1 is the price consumers are willing to pay to acquire
                         that quantity. Total revenue is the area of the rectangle P1 × Q1.

Supply Analysis in Monopolistically Competitive Markets
In perfect competition, the firm’s supply schedule is represented by the marginal
cost schedule. In monopolistic competition, there is no well-defined supply function.
The information used to determine the appropriate level of output is based on the
intersection of MC and MR. However, the price that will be charged is based on the
market demand schedule. The firm’s supply curve should measure the quantity the
firm is willing to supply at various prices. That information is not represented by
either marginal cost or average cost.


Optimal Price and Output in Monopolistically Competitive
Markets
In the short run, the profit-maximizing choice is the level of output at which MR =
MC and total revenue is the area of the rectangle P1 × Q1 shown in Exhibit 14.
    The average cost of producing Q1 units of the product is C1, and the total cost is
the area of the rectangle C1 × Q1. The difference between TR and TC is economic
profit. The profit relationship is described as follows:
   π = TR – TC,
   where π is total profit, TR is total revenue, and TC is total cost.

THE BENEFITS OF IMPERFECT COMPETITION

  Is monopolistic competition indeed imperfect—that is, is it a bad thing? At first,
  one would say that it is an inefficient market structure because prices are higher
  and the quantity supplied is less than in perfect competition. At the same time, in
  the real world, we see more markets characterized by monopolistic competition
  than markets meeting the strict conditions of perfect competition. If monopolistic
  competition were that inefficient, one wonders, why would it be so common?
      A part of the explanation goes back to Schumpeter. Firms try to differenti-
  ate their products to meet the needs of customers. Differentiation provides a
  profit incentive to innovate, experiment with new products and services, and
  potentially improve the standard of living.
      Moreover, because each customer has differing tastes and preferences, slight
  variations of each good or service are likely to capture the niche of the market
  that prefers them. An example is the market for candy, where one can find
  chocolate, licorice, mint, fruit, and many other flavors.
      Another reason why monopolistic competition may be good is that people
  like variety. Traditional economic theories of international trade suggested that
  countries should buy products from other countries that they cannot produce
  domestically. Therefore, Norway should buy bananas from a tropical country
  and sell crude oil in exchange. But this is not the only kind of exchange that
  happens in reality: For example, Germany imports Honda, Subaru, and Toyota
  cars from Japan and sells Volkswagen, Porsche, Mercedes, and BMW cars to
  Japan. In theory, this should not occur because each of the countries produces
  good cars domestically and does not need to import them. The truth, however,
  is that consumers in both countries enjoy variety. Some Japanese drivers prefer
  to be at the steering wheel of a BMW; others like Hondas, and the same happens
  in Germany. Variety and product differentiation, therefore, are not necessarily
  bad things.

                         Long-Run Equilibrium in Monopolistic Competition
                         Because total cost includes all costs associated with production, including opportu-
                         nity cost, economic profit is a signal to the market, and that signal will attract more
                         competition. Just as with the perfectly competitive market structure, with relatively
                         low entry costs, more firms will enter the market and lure some customers away from
                         the firm making an economic profit. The loss of customers to new entrant firms will
                         drive down the demand for all firms producing similar products. In the long run for
                         the monopolistically competitive firm, economic profit will fall to zero. Exhibit 15
                         illustrates the condition of long-run equilibrium for monopolistic competition.

                         In long-run equilibrium, output is still optimal at the level at which MR = MC, which
                         is Q1 in Exhibit 15. Again, the price consumers are willing to pay for any amount of
                         the product is determined from the demand curve. That price is P1 for the quantity
                         Q1 in Exhibit 15, and total revenue is the area of the rectangle P1 × Q1. Notice that
                         unlike long-run equilibrium in perfect competition, in the market of monopolistic
                         competition, the equilibrium position is at a higher level of average cost than the level
                         of output that minimizes average cost. Average cost does not reach its minimum until
                         output level Q2 is achieved. Total cost in this long-run equilibrium position is the area
                         of the rectangle C1 × Q1. Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost. In Exhibit
                         15, economic profit is zero because total revenue equals total cost: P1 × Q1 = C1 × Q1.
                              In the hybrid market of monopolistic competition, zero economic profit in long-run
                         equilibrium resembles perfect competition. However, the long-run level of output, Q1,
                         is less than Q2, which corresponds to the minimum average cost of production and
                         would be the long-run level of output in a perfectly competitive market. In addition,
                         the economic cost in monopolistic competition includes some cost associated with
                         product differentiation, such as advertising. In perfect competition, no costs are asso-
                         ciated with advertising or marketing because all products are homogeneous. Prices
                         are lower, but consumers may have little variety.

OLIGOPOLY

             the optimal price and output for firms as well as pricing strategy



Oligopoly and Pricing Strategies
An oligopoly market structure is characterized by only a few firms doing business in
a relevant market. The products must all be similar and generally are substitutes for
one another. In some oligopoly markets, the goods or services may be differentiated
by marketing and strong brand recognition, as in the markets for breakfast cereals
and for bottled or canned beverages. Other examples of oligopoly markets are made
up of homogeneous products with little or no attempt at product differentiation, such
as petroleum and cement. The most distinctive characteristic of oligopoly markets is
the small number of firms that dominate the market. There are so few firms in the
relevant market that their pricing decisions are interdependent. That is, each firm’s
pricing decision is based on the expected retaliation by the other firms. Recall the
characteristics of oligopoly markets:
   1. There are a small number of potential sellers.
   2. The products offered by each seller are close substitutes for the products
      offered by other firms and may be differentiated by brand or homogeneous
      and unbranded.
   3. Entry into the market is difficult, with fairly high costs and significant barri-
      ers to competition.
   4. Firms typically have substantial pricing power.
   5. Products are often highly differentiated through marketing, features, and
      other non-price strategies.
    Because there are so few firms, each firm can have some degree of pricing power,
which can result in substantial profits. Another by-product of the oligopoly market
structure is the attractiveness of price collusion. Even without price collusion, a
dominant firm may easily become the price maker in the market. Oligopoly markets

                         without collusion typically have the most sophisticated pricing strategies. Perhaps the
                         most well-known oligopoly market with collusion is the Organization of the Petroleum
                         Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel, which seeks to control prices in the petroleum
                         market by fostering agreements among oil-producing countries.


                         Demand Analysis and Pricing Strategies in Oligopoly Markets
                         Oligopoly markets’ demand curves depend on the degree of pricing interdependence.
                         In a market in which collusion is present, the aggregate market demand curve is divided
                         by the individual production participants. Under non-colluding market conditions,
                         each firm faces an individual demand curve. Furthermore, non-colluding oligopoly
                         market demand characteristics depend on the pricing strategies adopted by the par-
                         ticipating firms. The three basic pricing strategies are pricing interdependence, the
                         Cournot assumption, and the Nash equilibrium.
                             The first pricing strategy assumes pricing interdependence among the firms in the
                         oligopoly. A good example of this situation is any market in which there are “price
                         wars,” such as the commercial airline industry. For example, flying out of their hubs in
                         Atlanta, both Delta Air Lines and AirTran Airways jointly serve several cities. AirTran
                         is a low-cost carrier and typically offers lower fares to destinations out of Atlanta.
                         Delta tends to match the lower fares for those cities also served by AirTran when the
                         departure and arrival times are similar to its own. When Delta offers service to the
                         same cities at different time slots, however, Delta’s ticket prices are higher.
                             The most common pricing strategy assumption in these price war markets is that
                         competitors will match a price reduction and ignore a price increase. The logic is
                         that by lowering its price to match a competitor’s price reduction, the firm will not
                         experience a reduction in customer demand. Conversely, by not matching the price
                         increase, the firm stands to attract customers away from the firm that raised its prices.
                         The oligopolist’s demand relationship must represent the potential increase in market
                         share when rivals’ price increases are not matched and no significant change in market
                         share when rivals’ price decreases are matched.
                             Given a prevailing price, the price elasticity of demand will be much greater if the
                         price is increased and less if the price is decreased. The firm’s customers are more
                         responsive to price increases because its rivals have lower prices. Alternatively, the
                         firm’s customers are less responsive to price decreases because its rivals will match
                         its price change.
                             This implies that the oligopolistic firm faces two different demand structures: one
                         associated with price increases and another relating to price reductions. Each demand
                         function will have its own marginal revenue structure as well. Consider the demand and
                         marginal revenue functions in Exhibit 16(A). The functions DP↑ and MRP↑ represent
                         the demand and marginal revenue schedules associated with higher prices, whereas
                         the functions DP↓ and MRP↓ represent the lower prices’ demand and marginal revenue
                         schedules. The two demand schedules intersect at the prevailing price (i.e., the price
                         at which the price increase and price decrease are both equal to zero).

This oligopolistic pricing strategy results in a kinked demand curve, with the two
segments representing the different competitor reactions to price changes. The kink
in the demand curve also yields a discontinuous marginal revenue structure, with one
part associated with the price increase segment of demand and the other relating to
the price decrease segment. Therefore, the firm’s overall demand equals the relevant
portion of DP↑ and the relevant portion of DP↓. Exhibit 16(B) represents the firm’s
new demand and marginal revenue schedules. The firm’s demand schedule shown in
Exhibit 16(B) is segment DP↑ and DP↓, where overall demand D = DP↑ + DP↓.

Exhibit 16(B) shows that a wide variety of cost structures are consistent with the pre-
vailing price. If the firm has relatively low marginal costs, MC1, the profit-maximizing
pricing rule established earlier, MR = MC, still holds for the oligopoly firm. Marginal
cost can rise to MC2 and MC3 before the firm’s profitability is challenged. If the

                         marginal cost curve MC2 passes through the gap in marginal revenue, the most prof-
                         itable price and output combination remains unchanged at the prevailing price and
                         original level of output.
                             Criticism of the kinked demand curve analysis focuses on its inability to determine
                         what the prevailing price is from the outset. The kinked demand curve analysis helps
                         explain why stable prices have been observed in oligopoly markets and therefore is
                         a useful tool for analyzing such markets. However, because it cannot determine the
                         original prevailing price, it is considered to be an incomplete pricing analysis.


                         The Cournot Assumption
                         The second pricing strategy was first developed by French economist Augustin Cournot
                         in 1838. In the Cournot assumption, each firm determines its profit-maximizing pro-
                         duction level by assuming that the other firms’ output will not change. This assumption
                         simplifies pricing strategy because there is no need to guess what the other firm will
                         do to retaliate. It also provides a useful approach to analyzing real-world behavior in
                         oligopoly markets. Take the most basic oligopoly market situation, a two-firm duopoly
                         market. In equilibrium, neither firm has an incentive to change output, given the
                         other firm’s production level. Each firm attempts to maximize its own profits under
                         the assumption that the other firm will continue producing the same level of output
                         in the future. The Cournot strategy assumes that this pattern continues until each
                         firm reaches its long-run equilibrium position. In long-run equilibrium, output and
                         price are stable: No change in price or output will increase profits for either firm.
                             Consider this example of a duopoly market. Assume that the aggregate market
                         demand has been estimated to as follows:
                             QD = 450 − P.
                         The supply function is represented by constant marginal cost MC = 30.
                             The Cournot strategy’s solution can be found by setting QD = q1 + q2, where q1 and
                         q2 represent the output levels of the two firms. Each firm seeks to maximize profit,
                         and each firm believes the other firm will not change output as it changes its own
                         output (i.e., Cournot’s assumption). The firm will maximize profit where MR = MC.
                         Rearranging the aggregate demand function in terms of price, we get:
                             P = 450 − QD = 450 − (q1+q2), and MC = 30.
                         Total revenue for each of the two firms is found by multiplying price and quantity:
                             	​T ​R1​ ​ = P ​q​1​ = (450 − ​q​1​− q​ ​2​) ​q​1​ = 450 ​q​1​− ​q​12​ − ​q​1​​q​2​, ​
                         and
                             	​T ​R2​ ​ = P ​q​2​ = (450 − ​q​1​− q​ ​2​) ​q​2​ = 450 ​q​2​− ​q​2​​q​1​− ​q​22​.​
                         Marginal revenue is defined as the change in total revenue, given a change in sales
                         (q1 or q2). For the profit-maximizing output, set MR = MC, or
                             450 − 2q1 − q2 = 30,
                         and
                             450 − q1 − 2q2 = 30.
                         Then find the simultaneous equilibrium for the two firms by solving the two equations
                         with two unknowns:
                             450 − 2q1 − q2 = 450 − q1 − 2q2.
                         Because q2 = q1 under Cournot’s assumption, insert this solution into the demand
                         function and solve as follows:
                             450 − 2q1 − q1 = 450 − 3q1 = 30.

Therefore, q1 = 140, q2 = 140, and Q = 280.
   The price is P = 450 − 280 = 170.
   In the Cournot strategic pricing solution, the market equilibrium price will be
170, and the aggregate output will be 280 units. This result, known as the Cournot
equilibrium, differs from the perfectly competitive market equilibrium because the
perfectly competitive price will be lower and the perfectly competitive output will be
higher. In general, non-competitive markets have higher prices and lower levels of
output in equilibrium when compared with perfect competition. In competition, the
equilibrium is reached when price equals marginal cost:
   PC = MRC = MC, so 450 − Q = 30,
   where PC is the competitive firm’s equilibrium price.
   Q = 420, and PC = 30.
Exhibit 17 describes the oligopoly, competitive, and monopoly market equilibrium
positions, where PM is the monopoly optimum price, PC is the competitive price, and
PCournot is the oligopoly price under the Cournot assumption.

In the later discussion regarding monopoly market structure, equilibrium will be estab-
lished where MR = MC. That solution is also shown in Exhibit 17. The monopoly firm’s
demand schedule is the aggregate market demand schedule. Therefore, the solution is
   MR = MC.
For the market demand function, total revenue is P × Q = 450Q − Q2 and MR = 450
− 2Q; therefore,
   450 − 2Q = 30   and   Q = 210.
From the aggregate demand function, solve for price:
   PM = 450 − 210 = 240.
Note that the Cournot solution falls between the competitive equilibrium and the
monopoly solution.

                             As the number of firms increases from two to three, from three to four, and so on,
                         the output and price equilibrium positions move toward the competitive equilibrium
                         solution. Historically, this result has been the theoretical basis for the antitrust policies
                         established in the United States.


                         The Nash Equilibrium
                         The third pricing strategy is attributed to one of the 1994 Nobel Prize winners, John
                         Nash, who first developed the general concepts. In the previous analysis, the concept
                         of market equilibrium occurs when firms are achieving their optimum remuneration
                         under the circumstances they face. In this optimum environment, the firm has no
                         motive to change price or output level. Existing firms are earning a normal return
                         (zero economic profit), leaving no motive for entry to or exit from the market. All of
                         the firms in the market are producing at the output level at which price equals the
                         average cost of production.
                             In game theory (the set of tools that decision makers use to consider responses by
                         rival decision makers), the Nash equilibrium is present when two or more participants
                         in a non-cooperative game have no incentive to deviate from their respective equilib-
                         rium strategies after they have considered and anticipated their opponent’s rational
                         choices or strategies. In the context of oligopoly markets, the Nash equilibrium is an
                         equilibrium defined by the characteristic that none of the oligopolists can increase
                         its profits by unilaterally changing its pricing strategy. The assumption is made that
                         each participating firm does the best it can, given the reactions of its rivals. Each
                         firm anticipates that the other firms will react to any change made by competitors by
                         doing the best they can under the altered circumstances. The firms in the oligopoly
                         market have interdependent actions. Their actions are non-cooperative, with each
                         firm making decisions that maximize its own profits. The firms do not collude in an
                         effort to maximize joint profits. The equilibrium is reached when all firms are doing
                         the best they can, given the actions of their rivals.
                             Exhibit 18 illustrates the duopoly result from the Nash equilibrium. Assume there
                         are two firms in the market, ArcCo and BatCo. ArcCo and BatCo can charge high
                         prices or low prices for the product. The market outcomes are shown in Exhibit 18.

Oligopoly                                                                                     35


For example, the top left solution indicates that when both ArcCo and BatCo offer the
product at low prices, ArcCo earns a profit of 50 and BatCo earns 70. The top right
solution shows that if ArcCo offers the product at a low price, BatCo earns zero profits.
The solution with the maximum joint profits is the lower right equilibrium, where
both firms charge high prices for the product. Joint profits are 800 in this solution.
    The Nash equilibrium, however, requires that each firm behaves in its own best
interest. BatCo can improve its position by offering the product at low prices when
ArcCo is charging high prices. In the lower left solution, BatCo maximizes its profits
at 350. Although ArcCo can earn 500 in its best solution, it can do so only if BatCo
also agrees to charge high prices. This option is clearly not in BatCo’s best interest
because it can increase its return from 300 to 350 by charging lower prices.
    This scenario brings up the possibility of collusion. If ArcCo agrees to share at least
51 of its 500 when both companies are charging high prices, BatCo should also be
willing to charge high prices. In general, such collusion is unlawful in most countries,
but it remains a tempting alternative. Clearly, conditions in oligopolistic industries
encourage collusion, with a small number of competitors and interdependent pricing
behavior. Collusion is motivated by several factors: increased profits, reduced cash
flow uncertainty, and improved opportunities to construct barriers to entry.
    When collusive agreements are made openly and formally, the firms involved
are called a cartel. In some cases, collusion is successful; other times, the forces of
competition overpower collusive behavior. The following six major factors affect the
chances of successful collusion:
   1. The number and size distribution of sellers. Successful collusion is more
      likely if the number of firms is small or if one firm is dominant. Collusion
      becomes more difficult as the number of firms increases or if the few firms
      have similar market shares. When the firms have similar market shares, the
      competitive forces tend to overshadow the benefits of collusion.
   2. The similarity of the products. When the products are homogeneous, collu-
      sion is more successful. The more differentiated the products, the less likely
      it is that collusion will succeed.
   3. Cost structure. The more similar the firms’ cost structures, the more likely it
      is that collusion will succeed.
   4. Order size and frequency. Successful collusion is more likely when orders are
      frequent, received on a regular basis, and relatively small. Frequent small
      orders, received regularly, diminish the opportunities and rewards for cheat-
      ing on the collusive agreement.
   5. The strength and severity of retaliation. Oligopolists will be less likely to
      break the collusive agreement if the threat of retaliation by the other firms
      in the market is severe.
   6. The degree of external competition. The main reason to enter into the formal
      collusion is to increase overall profitability of the market, and rising profits
      attract competition. For example, in 2016 the average extraction cost of a
      barrel of crude oil from Saudi Arabia was approximately $9, while the aver-
      age cost from United States shale oil fields was roughly $23.50. The cost of
      extracting oil from the Canadian tar sands in 2016 was roughly $27 per bar-
      rel. It is more likely that crude oil producers in the gulf countries will suc-
      cessfully collude because of the similarity in their cost structures (roughly
      $9–$10 per barrel). If OPEC had held crude oil prices down below $30 per
      barrel, there would not have been a viable economic argument to develop
      US shale oil fields through fracking or expand extraction from Canada’s tar

                                sands. OPEC’s successful cartel raised crude oil prices to the point at which
                                outside sources became economically possible and, in doing so, increased
                                the competition the cartel faces.
                              Other possible oligopoly strategies are associated with decision making based on
                         game theory. The Cournot equilibrium and the Nash equilibrium are examples of
                         specific strategic games. A strategic game is any interdependent behavioral choice
                         employed by individuals or groups that share a common goal (e.g., military units, sports
                         teams, or business decision makers). Another prominent decision-making strategy in
                         oligopolistic markets is the first-mover advantage in the Stackelberg model, named
                         after the economist who first conceptualized the strategy. The important difference
                         between the Cournot model and the Stackelberg model is that Cournot assumes that
                         in a duopoly market, decision making is simultaneous, whereas Stackelberg assumes
                         that decisions are made sequentially. In the Stackelberg model, the leader firm chooses
                         its output first and then the follower firm chooses after observing the leader’s output.
                         It can be shown that the leader firm has a distinct advantage—that is, being a first
                         mover. In the Stackelberg game, the leader can aggressively overproduce to force the
                         follower to scale back its production or even punish or eliminate the weaker oppo-
                         nent. This approach is sometimes referred to as a “top dog” strategy. The leader earns
                         more than in Cournot’s simultaneous game, while the follower earns less. Many other
                         strategic games are possible in oligopoly markets. The important conclusion is that
                         the optimal strategy of the firm depends on what its adversary does. The price and
                         marginal revenue the firm receives for its product depend on both its decisions and
                         its adversary’s decisions.


                         Oligopoly Markets: Optimal Price, Output, and Long-Run
                         Equilibrium
                         As in monopolistic competition, the oligopolist does not have a well-defined supply
                         function. That is, there is no way to determine the oligopolist’s optimal levels of output
                         and price independent of demand conditions and competitor’s strategies. However,
                         the oligopolist still has a cost function that determines the optimal level of supply.
                         Therefore, the profit-maximizing rule established earlier is still valid: The level of
                         output that maximizes profit is where MR = MC. The price to charge is determined
                         by what price consumers are willing to pay for that quantity of the product. Therefore,
                         the equilibrium price comes from the demand curve, whereas the output level comes
                         from the relationship between marginal revenue and marginal cost.
                             Consider an oligopoly market in which one of the firms is dominant and thus able
                         to be the price leader. Dominant firms generally have 40 percent or greater market
                         share. When one firm dominates an oligopoly market, it does so because it has greater
                         capacity, has a lower cost structure, was first to market, or has greater customer loyalty
                         than other firms in the market.
                             Assuming there is no collusion, the dominant firm becomes the price maker, and
                         therefore its actions are similar to monopoly behavior in its segment of the market.
                         The other firms in the market follow the pricing patterns of the dominant firm.
                         Why wouldn’t the price followers attempt to gain market share by undercutting the
                         dominant firm’s price? The most common explanation is that the dominant firm’s
                         supremacy often stems from a lower cost of production. Usually, the price followers
                         would rather charge a price that is even higher than the dominant firm’s price choice.
                         If they attempt to undercut the dominant firm, the followers risk a price war with a
                         lower-cost producer that can threaten their survival. Some believe that one explanation
                         for the price leadership position of the dominant firm is simply convenience. Only
                         one firm has to make the pricing decisions, and the others can simply follow its lead.

    Exhibit 19 establishes the dominant firm’s pricing decision. The dominant firm’s
demand schedule, DL, is a substantial share of the total market demand, DT. The
low-cost position of the dominant firm is represented by its marginal cost, MCL. The
sum of the marginal costs of the price followers is established as ΣMC F and represents
a higher cost of production than that of the price leader.

An important reason why the total demand curve and the leader demand curve are
not parallel is illustrated in Exhibit 19: The leader is the low-cost producer. Therefore,
as price decreases, fewer of the smaller suppliers will be able to profitably remain
in the market, and several will exit because thwey do not want to sell below cost.
Therefore, the leader will have a larger market share as P decreases, which implies
that QL increases at a low price, exactly as shown by a steeper DT in the diagram.
    The price leader identifies its profit-maximizing output where MRL = MCL, at
output QL. This is the quantity it wants to supply; however, the price it will charge is
determined by its segment of the total demand function, DL. At price PL, the dominant
firm will supply quantity QL of total demand, DT. The price followers will supply the
difference to the market, (QT − QL) = QF. Therefore, neither the dominant firm nor
the follower firms have a single functional relationship that determines the quantity
supplied at various prices.

Optimal Price and Output in Oligopoly Markets
As this discussion shows, clearly no single optimum price and output analysis fits all
oligopoly market situations. The interdependence among the few firms that make up
the oligopoly market provides a complex set of pricing alternatives, depending on the
circumstances in each market. In the case of the kinked demand curve, the optimum
price is the prevailing price at the kink in the demand function. As noted, however,
the kinked demand curve analysis does not provide insight into what established the
prevailing price in the first place.
    Perhaps the case of the dominant firm, with the other firms following the price
leader, is the most obvious. In that case, the optimal price is determined at the output
level where MR = MC. The profit-maximizing price is then determined by the output
position of the segment of the demand function faced by the dominant firm. The price

                         followers have little incentive to change the leader’s price. In the case of the Cournot
                         assumption, each firm assumes that the other firms will not alter their output following
                         the dominant firm’s selection of its price and output level.
                              Therefore, again, the optimum price is determined by the output level where MR
                         = MC. In the case of the Nash equilibrium, each firm will react to the circumstances
                         it faces, maximizing its own profit. These adjustments continue until prices and levels
                         of output are stable. Because of the interdependence, the individual firm’s price and
                         output level remain uncertain.

                         Factors Affecting Long-Run Equilibrium in Oligopoly Markets
                         Long-run economic profits are possible for firms operating in oligopoly markets.
                         History has shown that, however, the market share of the dominant firm declines.
                         Profits attract entry by other firms into the oligopoly market. Over time, the marginal
                         costs of the entrant firms decrease because they adopt more efficient production
                         techniques, the dominant firm’s demand and marginal revenue shrink, and the prof-
                         itability of the dominant firm declines. In the early 1900s, J.P. Morgan, Elbert Gary,
                         Andrew Carnegie, and Charles M. Schwab created the United States Steel Corporation
                         (US Steel). When it was first formed in 1901, US Steel controlled 66 percent of the
                         market. By 1920, US Steel’s market share had declined to 46 percent, and by 1925 its
                         market share was 42 percent.
                             In the long run, optimal pricing strategy must include the reactions of rival firms.
                         History has proven that pricing wars should be avoided because any gains in market
                         share are temporary. Decreasing prices to drive away competitors lowers total rev-
                         enue to all participants in the oligopoly market. Innovation may be a way—though
                         sometimes an uneconomical one—to maintain market leadership.

                          OLIGOPOLIES: APPEARANCE VERSUS BEHAVIOR

                            When is an oligopoly not an oligopoly? There are two extreme cases of this
                            situation. A normal oligopoly has a few firms producing a differentiated good,
                            and this differentiation gives them pricing power.
                                 At one end of the spectrum, we have the oligopoly with a credible threat of
                            entry. In practice, if the oligopolists are producing a good or service that can be
                            easily replicated, has limited economies of scale, and is not protected by brand
                            recognition or patents, they will not be able to charge high prices. The easier it
                            is for a new supplier to enter the market, the lower the margins. In practice, this
                            oligopoly will behave very much like a perfectly competitive market.
                                 At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have the case of the cartel. Here,
                            the oligopolists collude and act as if they were a single firm. In practice, a very
                            effective cartel enacts a cooperative strategy. Instead of going to a Nash equi-
                            librium, the cartel participants go to the more lucrative (for them) cooperative
                            equilibrium.
                                 A cartel may be explicit (i.e., based on a contract) or implicit (based on
                            signals). An example of signals in a duopoly would be that one of the firms
                            reduces its prices and the other does not. Because the firm not cutting prices
                            refuses to start a price war, the firm that cut prices may interpret this signal as
                            a “suggestion” to raise prices to a higher level than before, so that profits may
                            increase for both.

QUESTION SET


  1. Oligopolistic pricing strategy most likely results in a demand curve
     that is:
      A. kinked.
      B. vertical.
      C. horizontal.
     Solution:
     A is correct. The oligopolist faces two different demand structures, one for
     price increases and another for price decreases. Competitors will lower pric-
     es to match a price reduction, but will not match a price increase. The result
     is a kinked demand curve.

  2. Collusion is less likely in a market when:
      A. the product is homogeneous.
      B. companies have similar market shares.
      C. the cost structures of companies are similar.
     Solution:
     B is correct. When companies have similar market shares, competitive forc-
     es tend to outweigh the benefits of collusion.

  3. In an industry composed of three companies, which are small-scale manu-
     facturers of an easily replicable product unprotected by brand recognition
     or patents, the most representative model of company behavior is:
      A. oligopoly.
      B. perfect competition.
      C. monopolistic competition.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The credible threat of entry holds down prices and multiple
     incumbents are offering undifferentiated products.

  4. Deep River Manufacturing is one of many companies in an industry that
     makes a food product. Deep River units are identical up to the point they
     are labeled. Deep River produces its labeled brand, which sells for $2.20 per
     unit, and “house brands” for seven different grocery chains, which sell for
     $2.00 per unit. Each grocery chain sells both the Deep River brand and its
     house brand. The best characterization of Deep River’s market is:
      A. oligopoly.
      B. perfect competition.
      C. monopolistic competition.
     Solution:
     C is correct. There are many competitors in the market, but some product
     differentiation exists, as the price differential between Deep River’s brand
     and the house brands indicates.

                            in which demand is much less price sensitive. SigmaSoft’s product is considered
                            to be technically superior. Each company can choose one of two strategies:
                                Open architecture (Open): Mass market focus allowing other software
                                venders to develop products for its platform.

                                Proprietary (Prop): Allow only its own software applications to run on its
                                platform.


                            5. Depending upon the strategy each company selects, their profits would be:

                                    SigmaSoft – Open                      SigmaSoft – Prop

                                     800                                 600
                                                        300                                  400
                                              ThetaTech – Prop                   ThetaTech – Prop



                            6. The Nash equilibrium for these companies is:
                                A. proprietary for SigmaSoft and proprietary for ThetaTech.
                                B. open architecture for SigmaSoft and proprietary for ThetaTech.
                                C. proprietary for SigmaSoft and open architecture for ThetaTech.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. In the Nash model, each company considers the other’s reac-
                               tion in selecting its strategy. In equilibrium, neither company has an incen-
                               tive to change its strategy. ThetaTech is better off with open architecture
                               regardless of what SigmaSoft decides. Given this choice, SigmaSoft is better
                               off with a proprietary platform. Neither company will change its decision
                               unilaterally.

Monopoly markets and other situations in which companies have pricing power can
be inefficient because producers constrain output to cause an increase in prices.
Therefore, less of the good will be consumed, and it will be sold at a higher price,
which is generally inefficient for the overall market. As a result, many countries have
introduced competition law to regulate the degree of competition in many industries.
    Market power in the real world is not always as clear as it is in textbook exam-
ples. Governments and regulators often have the difficult task of measuring market
power and establishing whether a firm has a dominant position that may resemble a
monopoly. A few historical examples of this are as follows:
   1. In the 1990s, US regulators prosecuted agricultural corporation Archer
      Daniels Midland for conspiring with Japanese competitors to fix the price of
      lysine, an amino acid used as an animal feed additive. The antitrust action
      resulted in a settlement that involved more than US$100 million in fines
      paid by the cartel members.
   2. In the 1970s, US antitrust authorities broke up the local telephone monop-
      oly, leaving AT&T the long-distance business (and opening that business
      to competitors), and required AT&T to divest itself of the local telephone
      companies it owned. This antitrust decision brought competition, innova-
      tion, and lower prices to the US telephone market.
   3. European regulators (specifically, the European Commission) have affected
      the mergers and monopoly positions of European corporations (as in the
      case of the companies Roche, Rhone-Poulenc, and BASF, which were at the
      center of a vitamin price-fixing case) as well as non-European companies
      (such as Intel) that do business in Europe. Moreover, the merger between
      the US company General Electric and the European company Honeywell
      was denied by the European Commission on grounds of excessive market
      concentration.
    Quantifying excessive market concentration is difficult. Sometimes, regulators
need to measure whether something that has not yet occurred might generate exces-
sive market power. For example, a merger between two companies might allow the
combined company to be a monopolist or quasi-monopolist in a certain market.
    A financial analyst hearing news about a possible merger should always consider
the impact of competition law (sometimes called antitrust law)—that is, whether a
proposed merger may be blocked by regulators in the interest of preserving a com-
petitive market.


Econometric Approaches
How should one measure market power? The theoretical answer is to estimate the
elasticity of demand and supply in a market. If demand is very elastic, the market
must be very close to perfect competition. If demand is rigid (inelastic), companies
may have market power.
    From the econometric point of view, this estimation requires some attention.
The problem is that observed price and quantity are the equilibrium values of price
and quantity and do not represent the value of either supply or demand. Technically,
this is called the problem of endogeneity, in the sense that the equilibrium price and
quantity are jointly determined by the interaction of demand and supply. Therefore,
to have an appropriate estimation of demand and supply, we need to use a model with
two equations: an equation of demanded quantity (as a function of price, income of
the buyers, and other variables) and an equation of supplied quantity (as a function
of price, production costs, and other variables). The estimated parameters will then
allow us to compute elasticity.

                             Regression analysis is useful in computing elasticity but requires a large number
                         of observations. Therefore, one may use a time-series approach and, for example,
                         look at 20 years of quarterly sales data for a market. The market structure may have
                         changed radically over those 20 years, however, and the estimated elasticity may not
                         apply to the current situation. Moreover, the supply curve may change because of a
                         merger among large competitors, and the estimation based on past data may not be
                         informative regarding the future state of the market postmerger.
                             An alternative approach is a cross-sectional regression analysis. Instead of looking
                         at total sales and average prices in a market over time (the time-series approach men-
                         tioned earlier), we can look at sales from different companies in the market during the
                         same year, or even at single transactions from many buyers and companies. Clearly,
                         this approach requires a substantial data-gathering effort, and therefore, this estima-
                         tion method can be complicated. Moreover, different specifications of the explanatory
                         variables (e.g., using total GDP rather than median household income or per-capita
                         GDP to represent income) may lead to dramatically different estimates.


                         Simpler Measures
                         Trying to avoid these drawbacks, analysts often use simpler measures to estimate
                         elasticity. The simplest measure is the concentration ratio, which is the sum of the
                         market shares of the largest N firms. To compute this ratio, one would, for example,
                         add the sales values of the largest 10 firms and divide this figure by total market sales.
                         This number is always between 0 (perfect competition) and 100 percent (monopoly).
                             The main advantage of the concentration ratio is that it is simple to compute, as
                         shown previously. The disadvantage is that it does not directly quantify market power.
                         In other words, is a high concentration ratio a clear signal of monopoly power? A
                         company may be the only incumbent in a market, but if the barriers to entry are low,
                         the simple presence of a potential entrant may be sufficient to convince the incumbent
                         to behave like a firm in perfect competition. For example, a sugar wholesaler may be
                         the only one in a country, but the knowledge that other large wholesalers in the food
                         industry might easily add imported sugar to their range of products should convince
                         the sugar wholesaler to price its product as if it were in perfect competition.
                             Another disadvantage of the concentration ratio is that it tends to be unaffected
                         by mergers among the top market incumbents. For example, if the largest and
                         second-largest incumbents merge, the pricing power of the combined entity is likely
                         to be larger than that of the two preexisting companies. But the concentration ratio
                         may not change much.

                          CALCULATING THE CONCENTRATION RATIO

                            Suppose there are eight producers of a certain good in a market. The largest
                            producer has 35 percent of the market, the second largest has 25 percent, the
                            third has 20 percent, the fourth has 10 percent, and the remaining four have 2.5
                            percent each. If we computed the concentration ratio of the top three producers,
                            it would be 35 + 25 + 20 = 80 percent, while the concentration ratio of the top
                            four producers would be 35 + 25 + 20 + 10 = 90 percent.
                                If the two largest companies merged, the new concentration ratio for the
                            top three producers would be 60 (the sum of the market shares of the merged
                            companies) + 20 + 10 = 90 percent, and the concentration ratio for the four top
                            producers would be 92.5 percent. Therefore, this merger affects the concentra-
                            tion ratio very mildly, even though it creates a substantial entity that controls
                            60 percent of the market.

      For example, the effect of consolidation in the US retail gasoline market has
  resulted in increasing degrees of concentration. In 1992, the top four companies
  in the US retail gasoline market shared 33 percent of the market. By 2001, the top
  four companies controlled 78 percent of the market (Exxon Mobil 24 percent,
  Shell 20 percent, BP/Amoco/Arco 18 percent, and Chevron/Texaco 16 percent).

    To avoid the known issues with concentration ratios, economists O. C. Herfindahl
and A. O. Hirschman suggested an index in which the market shares of the top N
companies are first squared and then added. If one firm controls the whole market
(a monopoly), the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI) equals 1. If there are M firms
in the industry with equal market shares, then the HHI equals (1/M). This provides a
useful gauge for interpreting an HHI. For example, an HHI of 0.20 would be analogous
to having the market shared equally by five firms.
    The HHI for the top three companies in the example in the box above would be
0.352 + 0.252 + 0.202 = 0.225 before the merger, whereas after the merger, it would be
0.602 + 0.202 + 0.102 = 0.410, which is substantially higher than the initial 0.225. The
HHI is widely used by competition regulators; however, just like the concentration
ratio, the HHI does not take the possibility of entry into account, nor does it consider
the elasticity of demand. Therefore, the HHI has limited use for a financial analyst
trying to estimate the potential profitability of a company or group of companies.

EXAMPLE 4

  The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index

  1. Suppose a market has 10 suppliers, each of them with 10 percent of the
     market. What are the concentration ratio and the HHI of the top four firms?
      A. Concentration ratio 4 percent and HHI 40
      B. Concentration ratio 40 percent and HHI 0.4
      C. Concentration ratio 40 percent and HHI 0.04
     Solution:
     C is correct. The concentration ratio for the top four firms is 10 + 10 + 10 +
     10 = 40 percent, and the HHI is 0.102 × 4 = 0.01 × 4 = 0.04.

                            4. One disadvantage of the Herfindahl–Hirschman index is that the index:
                                A. is difficult to compute.
                                B. fails to reflect low barriers to entry.
                                C. fails to reflect the effect of mergers in the industry.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. The Herfindahl–Hirschman index does not reflect low barriers
                               to entry that may restrict the market power of companies currently in the

                             A. economies of scale.

                             C. constant returns to scale.

                         8. A company is experiencing economies of scale when:
                             A. cost per unit increases as output increases.

                             B. it is operating at a point on the LRAC curve at which the slope is negative.

                             C. it is operating beyond the minimum point on the long-run average total cost
                                curve.

                         9. Diseconomies of scale most likely result from:
                             A. specialization in the labor force.

                             B. overlap of business functions and product lines.

                             C. discounted prices on resources when buying in larger quantities.

                         10. A firm is operating beyond minimum efficient scale in a perfectly competitive
                             industry. To maintain long-term viability, the most likely course of action for the
                             firm is to:
                             A. operate at the current level of production.

                             B. increase its level of production to gain economies of scale.

                             C. decrease its level of production to the minimum point on the long-run aver-
                                age total cost curve.

                         11. Companies most likely have a well-defined supply function when the market
                             structure is:
                             A. oligopoly.

                             B. perfect competition.

                             C. monopolistic competition.

                         12. Aquarius, Inc. is the dominant company and the price leader in its market. One
                             of the other companies in the market attempts to gain market share by undercut-
                             ting the price set by Aquarius. The market share of Aquarius will most likely:
                             A. increase.

                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. C is correct. The firm should shut down production when marginal revenue is
                            less than or equal to average variable cost.

                         2. A is correct. A company is said to break even if its total revenue is equal to its
                            total cost. Under conditions of perfect competition, a company will break even
                            when market price is equal to the minimum point of the average total cost curve.

                         3. B is correct. A company will shut down production in the short run when total
                            revenue is below total variable costs.

                         4. C is correct. A company will stay in the market in the long term if total revenue is
                            equal to or greater than total cost. Because total costs are $7 million ($4 million
                            variable costs and $3 million fixed costs), the company will stay in the market in
                            the long term if total revenue equals at least $7 million.

                         5. B is correct. When total revenue is enough to cover variable costs but not total
                            fixed costs in full, the firm can survive in the short run but would not be able to
                            maintain financial solvency in the long run.

                         6. A is correct. Competition should drive prices down to long-run marginal cost,
                            resulting in only normal profits being earned.

                         7. C is correct. Output increases in the same proportion as input increases occur at
                            constant returns to scale.

                         8. B is correct. Economies of scale occur if, as the firm increases output, cost per
                            unit of production falls. Graphically, this definition translates into an LRAC with
                            a negative slope.

                         9. B is correct. As the firm increases output, diseconomies of scale and higher av-
                            erage total costs can result when business functions and product lines overlap or
                            are duplicated.

                         10. C is correct. The firm operating at greater than long-run efficient scale is subject
                             to diseconomies of scale. It should plan to decrease its level of production.

                         11. B is correct. A company in a perfectly competitive market must accept whatever
                             price the market dictates. The marginal cost schedule of a company in a perfectly
                             competitive market determines its supply function.

                         12. A is correct. As prices decrease, smaller companies will leave the market rather
                             than sell below cost. The market share of Aquarius, the price leader, will increase.

                         13. B is correct. The dominant company’s market share tends to decrease as profits
                             attract entry by other companies.

INTRODUCTION
A typical economy’s output of goods and services fluctuates around its long-term
                                                                                             1
path. We now turn our attention to those recurring, cyclical fluctuations in economic
output. Some of the factors that influence short-term changes in the economy—such
as changes in population, technology, and capital—are the same as those that affect
long-term sustainable economic growth. But forces that cause shifts in aggregate
demand and aggregate supply curves—such as expectations, political developments,
natural disasters, and fiscal and monetary policy decisions—also influence economies,
particularly in the short run.
    We first describe a typical business cycle and its phases. While each cycle is dif-
ferent, analysts and investors need to be familiar with the typical cycle phases and
what they mean for the expectations and decisions of businesses and households
that influence the performance of sectors and companies. These behaviors also affect
financial conditions and risk appetite, thus affecting the setting of expectations and
choices of portfolio exposures to different investment sectors or styles.
    In the lessons that follow, we describe credit cycles, introduce several theories
of business cycles, and explain how different economic schools of thought interpret
the business cycle and their recommendations with respect to it. We also discuss

                                ■   Business cycles are recurrent expansions and contractions in
                                    economic activity affecting broad segments of the economy.
                                ■   Classical cycle refers to fluctuations in the level of economic activity
                                    (e.g., measured by GDP in volume terms).
                                ■   Growth cycle refers to fluctuations in economic activity around the
                                    long-term potential or trend growth level.
                                ■   Growth rate cycle refers to fluctuations in the growth rate of economic
                                    activity (e.g., GDP growth rate).
                                ■   The overall business cycle can be split into four phases: recovery,
                                    expansion, slowdown, and contraction.
                                ■   In the recovery phase of the business cycle, the economy is going
                                    through the “trough” of the cycle, where actual output is at its lowest
                                    level relative to potential output.
                                ■   In the expansion phase of the business cycle, output increases, and the
                                    rate of growth is above average. Actual output rises above potential
                                    output, and the economy enters the so-called boom phase.
                                ■   In the slowdown phase of the business cycle, output reaches its highest
                                    level relative to potential output (i.e., the largest positive output gap).
                                    The growth rate begins to slow relative to potential output growth, and
                                    the positive output gap begins to narrow.
                                ■   In the contraction phase of the business cycle, actual economic output
                                    falls below potential economic output.
                                ■   Credit cycles describe the changing availability—and pricing—of
                                    credit.
                                ■   Strong peaks in credit cycles are closely associated with subsequent
                                    systemic banking crises.
                                ■   Economic indicators are variables that provide information on the
                                    state of the overall economy.

                                    ●   Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually
                                        precede those of the overall economy.

                                    ●   Coincident economic indicators have turning points that usually
                                        are close to those of the overall economy.
                                    ●   Lagging economic indicators have turning points that take place
                                        later than those of the overall economy.
                                ■   A diffusion index reflects the proportion of a composite index of
                                    leading, lagging and coincident indicators that are moving in a pattern
                                    consistent with the overall index. Analysts often rely on these diffusion
                                    indexes to provide a measure of the breadth of the change in a com-

OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE
                                                                                                   2
                describe the business cycle and its phases

Business cycles are recurrent expansions and contractions in economic activity
affecting broad segments of the economy. In their 1946 book “Measuring Business
Cycles”, Burns and Mitchell define the business cycle as follows:
        Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic
        activity of nations that organize their work mainly in business enterprises:
        a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many
        economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions, contractions,
        and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle; this
        sequence of events is recurrent but not periodic; in duration, business
        cycles vary from more than one year to 10 or 12 years.
    This definition is rich with important insight. First, business cycles are typical of
economies that rely mainly on business enterprises—therefore, not agrarian societies
or centrally planned economies. Second, a cycle has an expected sequence of phases,
alternating between expansion and contraction, or upswings and downturns. Third,
such phases occur at about the same time throughout the economy. Finally, cycles are
recurrent; they happen again and again over time but not in a periodic way; they do
not all have the exact same intensity and duration. Exhibit 1 provides an illustration
of the pattern of economic growth rate in developed markets.

Burns and Mitchell’s definition remains helpful. History never repeats itself in quite
the same way, but it certainly does offer patterns that can be used when analyzing
the present and forecasting the future. Business cycle analysis is a wide-ranging topic
with conflicting perspectives held by industry participants.

                         Phases of the Business Cycle
                         Business cycles are recurring sequences of alternating upswings and downturns. The
                         business cycle can be broken into phases in various ways. The most obvious way is to
                         divide it into two primary segments: the expansion, or the upswing, and the contrac-
                         tion, or the downturn, with two key turning points, or peaks and troughs (see Exhibits
                         2 and 3). These two periods are fairly easy to identify in retrospect. Subdividing the
                         cycle more finely, however, becomes ambiguous, even in retrospect, because it requires
                         identifying more nuanced changes, such as acceleration or deceleration of growth
                         without a change in its direction. It thus is useful to divide the cycle into several phases
                         distinguished through both economic and financial market characteristics. Our focus
                         is on economic characteristics of the different phases, but we also will highlight their
                         implication for the behavior of different segments of the financial markets.
                              The timing of these periods will depend on the type of cycle. Before moving on
                         to the description of the four distinct phases to which we will refer in the subsequent
                         sections, we first explain the different cycle concepts that analysts should be aware
                         of given the range of different opinions, interpretations, and descriptions that prac-
                         titioners use.

                         Types of Cycles

                             ■     Classical cycle refers to fluctuations in the level of economic activity (e.g.,
                                   measured by GDP in volume terms). The contraction phases between peaks
                                   and troughs are often short, whereas expansion phases are much longer.
                                   Exhibit 2 shows the classical cycle of economic activity. In practice, the clas-
                                   sical cycle is not used extensively by academics and practitioners because it
                                   does not easily allow the breakdown of movements in GDP between short-
                                   term fluctuations and long-run trends. In addition, an absolute decline in
                                   activity between peaks and troughs does not occur frequently.

                             ■     Growth cycle refers to fluctuations in economic activity around the
                                   long-term potential or trend growth level. The focus is on how much actual
                                   economic activity is below or above trend growth in economic activity. The
                                   dashed “wave” in the lower part of Exhibit 3 captures the fluctuation of
                                   actual activity from trend growth activity. Exhibit 3 shows “gaps” between
                                   actual and trend output. The growth cycle definition comes closest to how
                                   mainstream economists think: It dissects overall economic activity into a

    ■     Growth rate cycle refers to fluctuations in the growth rate of economic
          activity (e.g., GDP growth rate). Peaks and troughs are mostly recognized
          earlier than when using the other two definitions (see Exhibit 4). One
          advantage of this approach is that it is not necessary to first estimate a
          long-run growth path. Nevertheless, economists often refer to economic
          growth being above or below potential growth rate, reflecting upswings or
          downturns.

                         Practical Issues
                         In practice, the definitions of a business cycle are used interchangeably, which often
                         causes confusion regarding how one labels the phases and their timing. The classical
                         cycle definition is rarely used. In line with how most economists and practitioners
                         view the cycle, we will generally be using the growth cycle concept in which business
                         cycles can be thought of as fluctuations around potential output (the trend in potential
                         output is shown as the upward sloping dotted line in Exhibit 3).

                         Four Phases of the Cycle
                         The overall business cycle can be split into four phases:
                              Recovery: The economy is going through the “trough” of the cycle, where actual
                         output is at its lowest level relative to potential output. Economic activity, including
                         consumer and business spending, is below potential but is starting to increase, closing
                         the negative output gap.
                              Expansion: The recovery gathers pace, output increases, and the rate of growth is
                         above average. Actual output rises above potential output, and the economy enters the
                         so-called boom phase. Consumers increase spending, and companies increase pro-
                         duction, employment, and investment. Prices and interest rates may start increasing.
                         As the expansion continues, the economy may start to experience shortages in factors
                         of production. Overinvestment in productive capacity may lead companies to reduce
                         further investment spending.
                              Slowdown: Output of the economy reaches its highest level relative to potential
                         output (largest positive output gap). The growth rate begins to slow relative to poten-
                         tial output growth, and the positive output gap begins to narrow. Consumers remain
                         optimistic about the economy, but companies may rely on overtime rather than using
                         new hires to meet demand. Inflation slows at some point, and price levels may decrease.
                              Contraction: Actual economic output falls below potential economic output.
                         Consumer and business confidence declines. Companies reduce costs by eliminating
                         overtime and reducing employment. The economy may experience declines in absolute
                         economic activity; a recession; or if the fall in activity is particularly large, a depression.
                         If the decline is moderate, this phase tends to be shorter than the expansion phase.
                              Exhibit 5 provides a summary of the key characteristics of each phase and describes
                         how several important economic variables evolve through the course of a business cycle.

Leads and Lags in Business and Consumer Decision Making
The behavior of businesses and households is key to the cycle and frequently incorpo-
rates leads and lags relative to what are established as turning points. For example, at
the beginning of an expansion phase, companies may want to fully use their existing
workforce and wait to hire new employees until they are sure that the economy is
indeed growing. However, gradually all economic variables are going to revert toward
their normal range of values (e.g., GDP growth will be close to potential, or average,
growth).


Market Conditions and Investor Behavior
Many economic variables and sectors of the economy have distinctive cyclical patterns.
Knowledge of these patterns can offer insight into likely cyclical directions overall, or
it can be particularly applicable to an investment strategy that requires more specific
rather than general cyclical insights for investment success.

Recovery Phase
When asset markets expect the end of a recession and the beginning of an expansion
phase, risky assets will be repriced upward. When an expansion is expected, the markets
will start incorporating higher profit expectations into the prices of corporate bonds
and stocks. Typically, equity markets will hit a trough about three to six months before
the economy bottoms out and well before the economic indicators turn up. Indeed, as
we will see later, the equity market is classified as a leading indicator of the economy.

Expansion Phase
When an economy’s expansion is well-established, a later part of an expansion, referred
to as a “boom,” often follows. The boom is an expansionary phase characterized by
economic growth “testing the limits” of the economy, strong confidence, profit, and
credit growth. For example, companies may expand so much that they have difficulty
finding qualified workers and will compete with other prospective employers by

                         raising wages and continuing to expand capacity, relying on strong cash flows and
                         borrowing. The government or central bank may step in if it is concerned about the
                         economy overheating.

                         Slowdown Phase
                         During the boom, the riskiest assets will often have substantial price increases. Safe
                         assets, such as government bonds that were more highly prized during recession,
                         may have lower prices and thus higher yields. In addition, investors may fear higher
                         inflation, which also contributes to higher nominal yields.

                         Contraction Phase
                         During contraction, investors place relatively high values on such safer assets as
                         government securities and shares of companies with steady (or growing) positive
                         cash flows, such as utilities and producers of staple goods. Such preferences reflect
                         the fact that the marginal utility of a safe income stream increases in periods when
                         employment is insecure or declining.

                          WHEN DO RECESSIONS BEGIN AND END?

                            A simple and commonly referred to rule is the following: A recession has started
                            when a country or region experiences two consecutive quarters of negative real
                            GDP growth. Real GDP growth is a measure of the “real” or “inflation-adjusted”
                            growth of the overall economy. This rule can be misleading because it does not
                            indicate a recession if real GDP growth is negative in one quarter, slightly positive
                            the next quarter, and again negative in the next quarter. Many analysts question
                            this result. This issue is why some countries have statistical and economic com-
                            mittees that apply the principles stated by Burns and Mitchell to several macro-
                            economic variables—not just real GDP growth—as a basis to identify business
                            cycle peaks and troughs. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)
                            is an organization that dates business cycles in the United States. Interestingly,
                            the economists and statisticians on NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee
                            analyze numerous time series of data focusing on employment, industrial
                            production, and sales. Because the data are available with a delay (preliminary
                            data releases can be revised even several years after the period they refer to), it
                            also means that the Committee’s determinations may take place well after the
                            business cycle turning points have occurred. As we will see later in the reading,
                            practical indicators may help economists understand in advance if a cyclical
                            turning point is about to happen.

                            1. Which of the following rules is most likely to be used to determine whether
                               the economy is in a recession?
                                A. The central bank has run out of foreign reserves.
                                B. Real GDP has two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
                                C. Economic activity experiences a significant decline in two business
                                   sectors.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. GDP is a measure of economic activity for the whole economy.
                               Changes in foreign reserves or a limited number of sectors may not have a
                               material impact on the whole economy.

                            2. Suppose you are interested in forecasting earnings growth for a company
                               active in a country where no official business cycle dating committee (such

      as the NBER) exists. The variables you are most likely to consider to identify
      peaks and troughs of a country’s business cycle are:
       A. inflation, interest rates, and unemployment.
       B. stock market values and money supply.
       C. unemployment, GDP growth, industrial production, and inflation.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Unemployment, GDP growth, industrial production, and
      inflation are measures of economic activity. The discount rate, the mone-
      tary base, and stock market indexes are not direct measures of economic
      activities. The first two are determined by monetary policy, which react to
      economic activities, whereas the stock market indexes tend to be forward
      looking or leading indicators of the economy.



QUESTION SET


   1. The characteristic business cycle patterns of trough, expansion,
      peak, and contraction are:
       A. periodic.
       B. recurrent.
       C. of similar duration.
      Solution:
      B is correct. The stages of the business cycle occur repeatedly over time.

   2. During the contraction phase of a business cycle, it is most likely that:
       A. inflation indicators are stable.
       B. aggregate economic activity relative to potential output is decreasing.
       C. investor preference for government securities declines.
      Solution:
      B is correct. The net trend during contraction is negative.

   3. An economic peak is most closely associated with:
       A. accelerating inflation.
       B. stable unemployment.
       C. declining capital spending.
      Solution:
      A is correct. Inflation is rising at peaks.




CREDIT CYCLES

                         Whereas business cycles mostly use GDP as a measure of economic activity, a body
                         of literature has emerged in which cyclical developments of financial variables are
                         analyzed separately. This is most commonly done in terms of credit and property
                         prices. Credit cycles describe the changing availability—and pricing—of credit. They
                         describe growth in private sector credit (availability and usage of loans), which is
                         essential for business investments and household purchases of real estate. Therefore,
                         they are connected to real economic activity captured by business cycles that describe
                         fluctuations in real GDP.
                             When the economy is strong or improving, the willingness of lenders to extend
                         credit, and on favorable terms, is high. Conversely, when the economy is weak or
                         weakening, lenders pull back, or “tighten” credit, by making it less available and
                         more expensive. This frequently contributes to the decline of such asset values as real
                         estate, causing further economic weakness and higher defaults. This is because of the
                         importance of credit in the financing of construction and the purchase of property.
                         Credit cycles are a subset of a wider family of so-called financial cycles, a topic that
                         goes beyond the scope of our coverage.


                         Applications of Credit Cycles
                         Financial factors were for a long time not prominent on the radar screens of macro-
                         economists. Monetary and financial phenomena were largely seen as a veil that could
                         be ignored when trying to understand the economy. But loose private sector credit
                         is considered to have contributed to several financial crises, such as the Latam crisis
                         of the 1980s; the Mexican, Brazilian, and Russian crises of the 1990s; the Asian crisis
                         of 1997–1998; and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–2009. Expansive credit condi-
                         tions often lead to asset price and real estate bubbles that burst when capital market
                         outflows and drawdowns occur mostly because of weaker fundamentals.
                             It is recognized that in a world with financial frictions, business cycles can be
                         amplified, with deeper recessions and more extensive expansions because of changes
                         in access to external financing. In line with this belief, it is found that the duration
                         and magnitude of recessions and recoveries are often shaped by linkages between
                         business and credit cycles. In particular, recessions accompanied by financial disrup-
                         tion episodes (notably, house and equity price busts), tend to be longer and deeper.
                         Recoveries combined with rapid growth in credit, risk-taking, and house prices tend
                         to be stronger.
                             Financial variables tend to co-vary closely with each other and can often help
                         explain the size of an economic expansion or contraction, but they are not always syn-
                         chronized with the traditional business cycle. Credit cycles tend to be longer, deeper,
                         and sharper than business cycles. Although the length of a business cycle varies from
                         peak to trough, the average length of a credit cycle is mostly found to be longer than
                         that of the business cycle. Exhibit 6 illustrates how credit cycles can be visualized.

                            versus Term Spread,” the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) provided a

                            that such cycles tend to boom before recessions.

Consequences for Policy
Investors pay attention to the stage in the credit cycle because (1) it helps them
understand developments in the housing and construction markets; (2) it helps them
assess the extent of business cycle expansions as well as contractions, particularly the
severity of a recession if it coincides with the contraction phase of the credit cycle;
and (3) it helps them better anticipate policy makers’ actions. Whereas monetary and
fiscal policy traditionally concentrate on reducing the volatility of business cycles,
macroprudential stabilization policies that aim to dampen financial booms have gained
importance. This is further stressed by findings that strong peaks in credit cycles are
closely associated with subsequent systemic banking crises.

QUESTION SET


   1. A senior portfolio manager at Carnara Asset Management explains
      her analysis of business cycles to a junior analyst. She makes two statements:

     Statement 1                Business cycles measure activity by GDP, whereas credit cycles
                                combine a range of financial variables, such as the amount of
                                and pricing of credit.
     Statement 2                Credit cycles and business cycles are unrelated and serve differ-
                                ent purposes.
          A. Only Statement 1 is true.
          B. Only Statement 2 is true.
       C. Both statements are true.
      Solution:
      A is correct. Only Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is not true because
      researchers have found linkages between financial and business cycles that
      help explain the magnitude of business cycle expansions and contractions
      depending on the state of the credit cycle.

                            2. With which sector of the economy would analysts most commonly associate
                               credit cycles?
                                A. Exports
                                B. Construction and purchases of property
                                C. Food retail
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Credit cycles are associated with availability of credit, which is
                               important in the financing of construction and the purchase of property.

                            3. The reason analysts follow developments in the availability of credit is that:
                                A. loose private sector credit may contribute to the extent of asset price
                                   and real estate bubbles and subsequent crises.
                                B. loose credit helps reduce the extent of asset price and real estate
                                   bubbles.
                                C. credit cycles are of same length and depth as business cycles.
                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Studies have shown that loose credit conditions contribute to
                               the extent of asset price and real estate bubbles that tend to be followed by
                               crises.




             4           ECONOMIC INDICATORS OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE

                                       describe how resource use, consumer and business activity, housing
                                       sector activity, and external trade sector activity vary over the
                                       business cycle and describe their measurement using economic
                                       indicators

                         This lesson provides a broad overview of how the use of resources needed to produce
                         goods and services typically evolves during a business cycle. We start by focusing on
                         circumstances of firms and explore some of the links between fluctuations in inven-
                         tory, employment, and investment in physical capital with economic fluctuations.


                         The Workforce and Company Costs
                         The pattern of hiring and employment is shown in Exhibit 7 . When the economy
                         enters contraction, companies reduce costs and eliminate overtime. They may try to
                         retain workers rather than reduce employment only to increase it later. Finding and
                         training new workers is costly, and it may be more cost efficient to keep workers on
                         the payroll even if they are not fully utilized. Companies may also benefit from an
                         implicit bond of loyalty between a company and its workers, boosting productivity
                         in the process. In prolonged contractions, companies will start reducing costs more
                         aggressively—terminating consultants, advertising campaigns, and workers beyond
                         the strict minimum. Capacity utilization will be low, and few companies will invest in
                         new equipment. Companies will try to liquidate their inventories of unsold products.
                         In addition, banks will be reluctant to lend because bankruptcy risks are perceived to
                         be higher, adding to the weakness in the economy.

    Decreases in aggregate demand are likely to depress wages or wage growth as
well as prices of inputs and capital goods. After a while, all of these input prices will
be relatively low. In addition, interest rates may be cut to try to revive the economy.
    As prices and interest rates decrease, consumers and companies may begin to
purchase more and aggregate demand may begin to rise. This stage is the turning
point of the business cycle: Aggregate demand starts to increase and economic activity
increases.

Fluctuations in Capital Spending
Capital spending—spending on tangible goods, such as property, plant, and equipment—
typically fluctuates with the business cycle. Because business profits and cash flows
are sensitive to changes in economic activity, capital spending is also highly sensitive
to changes in economic activity. In fact, investment is one of the most procyclical
and volatile components of GDP. Company spending decisions are driven by busi-
ness conditions, expectations, and levels of capacity utilization, all of which fluctuate
over the cycle. With regard to efficiency, firms will run “lean production” to generate
maximum output with the fewest number of workers at the end of contractions.
Exhibit 8 provides a description of capital spending over the cycle. Note that new
orders statistics include orders that will be delivered over several years. For example,

                                   it is common for airlines to order 40 airplanes to be delivered over five years. Where
                                   relevant, analysts use “core” orders that exclude defense and aircrafts for a better

EXAMPLE 1

  Capital Spending

  1. Levels of capacity utilization are one of the factors that determine compa-
     nies’ aggregate need for additional capital expenditure. Which of the follow-
     ing is another factor that affects the capital expenditure decision?
      A. The rate of unemployment
      B. The composition of the economy’s capacity in relation to how it can
         satisfy demand
      C. The ability to reinstate orders canceled during the contraction stage
     Solution:
     B is correct. The composition of the current productive capacity may not be
     optimal of the current structure of demand. C is incorrect because the abili-
     ty to re-instate canceled orders is a matter that is relevant once the decision
     to increase capital expenditure is made.

  2. Orders for technology and light equipment decline before construction
     projects in a contraction because:
      A. businesses are uncertain about cyclical directions.
      B. equipment orders are easier to cancel than large construction projects.
      C. businesses value light equipment less than structures and heavy
         machinery.
     Solution:
     B is correct. Because it usually takes much longer to plan and complete large
     construction projects than it takes to plan and complete equipment orders,
     construction projects may be less influenced by business cycles.



Fluctuations in Inventory Levels
The aggregate size of inventories is small relative to the size of the economy, but
their accumulation and cutbacks by businesses can occur with substantial speed and
frequency. Changing inventories reflect differences between the growth (or decline)
in sales and the growth (or decline) in production. A key indicator in this area is the
inventory–sales ratio that measures the inventories available for sale to the level of
sales. Analysts pay attention to inventories to gauge the position of the economy
in the cycle. Exhibit 9 shows how production, sales, and inventories typically move
through the phases of a cycle.

                                          Inventory Fluctuation

                                          1. Although a small part of the overall economy, changes in inventories can
                                             influence economic growth measures significantly because they:
                                                 A. reflect general business sentiment.
                                                 B. tend to move forcefully up or down.
                                              C. determine the availability of goods for sale.
                                             Solution:
                                             B is correct. Inventory levels can fluctuate dramatically over the business
                                             cycle.

                                          2. Inventories tend to rise when:
                                                 A. inventory–sales ratios are low.
                                                 B. inventory–sales ratios are high.
                                              C. economic activity begins to rebound.
                                             Solution:
                                             A is correct. When the economy starts to recover, sales of inventories can
                                             outpace production, which results in low inventory–sales ratios. Companies
                                             then need to accumulate more inventories to restore the ratio to normal
                                             level. C is incorrect because in the early stages of a recovery, inventories are
                                             likely to fall as sales increase faster than production.

                                          3. Inventories will often fall early in a recovery because:
                                                 A. businesses need profit.
                                                 B. sales outstrip production.
                                              C. businesses ramp up production because of increased economic
                                                 activity.
                                             Solution:
                                             B is correct. The companies are slow to increase production in the early
                                             recovery phase because they first want to confirm the recession is over. In-
                                             creasing output also takes time after the downsizing during the recession.

   4. In a recession, companies are most likely to adjust their stock of physical
      capital by:
        A. selling it at fire sale prices.
        B. not maintaining equipment.
         C. quickly canceling orders for new construction equipment.
        B is correct. Physical capital adjustments to downturns come through aging
        of equipment plus lack of maintenance.

   5. The inventory–sales ratio is most likely to be rising:
        A. as a contraction unfolds.
        B. partially into a recovery.
         C. near the top of an economic cycle.
        C is correct. Near the top of a cycle, sales begin to slow before production is
        cut, leading to an increase in inventories relative to sales.



Economic Indicators
Economic indicators are variables that provide information on the state of the overall
economy. They are statistics or data readings that reflect economic circumstances of a
country, group of countries, region, or sector. Economic indicators are used by policy
makers and analysts to understand and assess the existing condition of the economy and
its position in the cycle. They also can be used to help predict or confirm the turning
points in the cycle. Such knowledge allows analysts to better predict the financial and
market performance of stocks and bonds of issuers operating in different sectors of
the economy with different sensitivity to the economic cycle.


Types of Indicators
Economic indicators are often classified according to whether they lag, lead, or coin-
cide with changes in an economy’s growth.
    ■    Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually precede
         those of the overall economy. They are believed to have value for predicting
         the economy’s future state, usually near term.
    ■    Coincident economic indicators have turning points that are usually close
         to those of the overall economy. They are believed to have value for identify-
         ing the economy’s present state.
    ■    Lagging economic indicators have turning points that take place later than
         those of the overall economy. They are believed to have value in identify-
         ing the economy’s past condition and only change after a trend has been
         established.
    Exhibit 10 provides an illustration of several leading, lagging, and coincident indi-
cators. The leading indicators observed at a point in time labeled as time “1” indicate
the direction of the of the activity (output) at a future point in time, such as time “2.”
The lagging indicators, released around time “3,” refer to and help confirm what the
state of the economy was at time “2.”

                         Composite Indicators
                         An economic indicator either consists of a single variable, like industrial production
                         or the total value of outstanding building permits, or can be a composite of different
                         variables that all tend to move together. The latter are regularly labeled composite
                         indicators. Traditionally, most composite indicators to measure the cyclical state of
                         the economy consist of up to a dozen handpicked variables published by organizations
                         like the OECD or national research institutes. The exact variables combined into these
                         composites vary from one economy to the other. In each case, however, they bring
                         together various economic and financial measures that have displayed a consistently
                         leading, coincident, or lagging relationship to that economy’s general cycle.

                         The Conference Board, a US industry research organization, publishes a composite
                         leading indicator known as The Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI),
                         which consists of 10 component parts (it uses the classical business cycle as the under-
                         lying concept). Exhibit 11 presents the 10 components used in the LEI. In addition to
                         naming the indicators, it offers a general description of why each measure is leading
                         the business cycle.

                              Step 1
                                ●   Data release: Analyst notes an increase in the reported level of con-

                                ●   Analysis: The above indicator normally lags cyclical upturns.
                                ●   Possible conclusion: Initial evidence that an upturn has been
                                    underway.
                              Step 2
                                ●   Data release: Industrial Production Index and non-farm payrolls
                                    (employees on non-agricultural payrolls) are moving higher.
                                ●   Analysis: These coincident indicators suggest activity is picking up.
                                ●   Possible conclusion: Further evidence that expansion is underway.
                              Step 3

                                ●   Analysis: If the aggregate LEI is moving higher too, evidence suggests
                                    that recovery is underway. Confirmation that output is moving higher.

                         Other Composite Leading Indicators
                         For about 30 countries and several aggregates, such as the EU and G–7, the OECD
                         calculates OECD Composite Leading Indicator (CLI), which gauges the state of the
                         business cycle in the economy using the growth cycle concept. One of the interesting
                         features of OECD CLI is that the underlying methodology is consistent across several
                         countries. Therefore, it can be compared more easily to see how each region is faring.
                         Exhibit 13 shows the eight components of CLI used by the OECD. As is usually the
                         case with leading indicators, some data are based on surveys whereas others are based
                         on reported market or economic data.

The parallels that can be drawn between many of these components and those used
in the United States are clear, but the Euro area includes a services component in its
business activity measures that the United States lacks. Additionally, the Euro area
forgoes many of the overtime and employment gauges that the United States includes.
The OECD CLI for Japan is again similar, but it does include labor market indicators
(unlike the Euro area) and it adds a measure of business failures not included in the
other two.

GERMANY: THE IFO SURVEY

  The German ifo survey is a widely used index capturing business climate in
  Germany and is published monthly. Exhibit 14 shows how the index moved
  ahead of quarterly-reported year-over-year changes in German GDP. It also
  shows an uptick in 2018 despite the GDP growth downturn. These indicators
  are useful, but they are not foolproof.

                         Surveys
                         The composite indicators for region- or country-specific business cycles often make
                         use of economic tendency surveys. These monthly or quarterly surveys carried out
                         by central banks, research institutes, statistical offices, and trade associations are
                         conducted among either businesses, consumers, or experts. The mostly qualitative
                         questions posed are often on the state of their finances, level of activity, and confi-
                         dence in the future.
                              CIRET (a forum for leading economists and institutions that conducts and analyzes
                         business and consumer survey data), the United Nations, the OECD, and the European
                         Commission operate at different regional levels to harmonize and exchange knowledge
                         regarding these business tendency and consumer surveys. The Directorate-General
                         for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN) publishes fully harmonized results
                         for different sectors of the EU member and applicant economies. The Bank of Japan
                         carries out similar surveys and releases the findings in what is called the “Tankan
                         Report.” These diverse sources multiply within and across economies. Over the past
                         decade, so-called purchasing managers indexes along similar lines, albeit with often
                         much smaller survey samples, have been introduced in a wide range of countries and
                         regions, including Europe and China.
                              These economic tendency surveys are often aggregated into or are a part of compos-
                         ite indicators. IHS Markit publishes a global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) indi-
                         cator using results of its national business surveys (see Exhibit 13). A global consumer
                         confidence indicator is published by The Conference Board. Some other institutions
                         collect national survey data and calculate supranational results. For example, the OECD
                         publishes a business confidence indicator and a consumer confidence indicator for the
                         OECD aggregate in its report “Main Economic Indicators.” In addition, the European
                         Commission calculates various survey-based indicators for the EU, reflecting the
                         situation in Europe. Based on economic tendency surveys and using the growth rate
                         cycle concept, the Swiss Economic Institute (Konjunkturforschungsstelle or KOF) and
                         Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, publish a coincident
                         and a leading indicator for the world economy called the Global Economic Barometers.
                         These barometers incorporate hundreds of survey variables from around the world.


                         The Use of Big Data in Economic Indicators
                         The vast increase in this information and academic developments regarding the use
                         of big(ger) data have in recent years increased the number of variables that go into
                         these composite indicators. For instance, using a statistical technique called principal
                         components analysis, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago computes the Chicago
                         Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) using 85 monthly macroeconomic series. These
                         series cover industrial production, personal income, capital utilization, employment by
                         sectors, housing starts, retail sales, and so on. Principal components analysis extracts
                         the underlying trend that is common to most of these variables, thus distilling the
                         essence of the US business cycle. Similarly, the Bank of Italy in conjunction with
                         the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) produces the EuroCOIN statistic,
                         which is also based on principal component analysis. More than 100 macroeconomic
                         series are included in EuroCOIN. EuroCOIN also includes data derived from surveys,
                         interest rates, and other financial variables.

the “present,” they make use of a large variety of data—such as financial market
transactions, data from the usage of the large amounts of timely internet searches,
and electronic payment data—to provide estimates for key low-frequency (monthly
or quarterly) economic indicators. This process produces a nowcast, which is an esti-
mate of the current state, and we refer to the process of producing such an estimate
as nowcasting. It can be applied to various macroeconomic variables of interest, such
as GDP growth, inflation, or unemployment.


GDPNow
Nowcasts are produced by a number of entities in investment banking and asset man-
agement for their internal or client use, but they are also published by institutions,
such as the Atlanta Fed (the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, one of the 12 Federal
Reserve Banks in the United States). According to the Atlanta Fed, “GDPNow” is
“best viewed as a running estimate of real GDP growth based on available data for the
current measured quarter.” The objective is to forecast GDP for the current quarter
(which will not be released until after quarter-end) in real time based on data as they
are released throughout the quarter. To do this, the Atlanta Fed attempts to use the
same methodology and data as will be used by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) to estimate GDP, replacing data that have not yet been released with forecasts
based on the data already observed. As the quarter progresses, more of the actual
data will have been observed. GDPNow should, at least on average, converge to what
will be released by the BEA as their “advance” estimate of quarterly GDP about four
weeks after quarter-end.

DIFFUSION INDEX OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS

  In the United States, The Conference Board also compiles a monthly diffusion
  index of the leading, lagging, and coincident indicators. The diffusion index
  reflects the proportion of the index’s components that are moving in a pattern
  consistent with the overall index. Analysts often rely on these diffusion indexes
  to provide a measure of the breadth of the change in a composite index.
      For example, The Conference Board tracks the growth of each of the 10
  constituents of its LEI, assigning a value of 1.0 to each indicator that rises by
  more than 0.05 percent during the monthly measurement period, a value of
  0.5 for each component indicator that changes by less than 0.05 percent, and a
  value of 0 for each component indicator that falls by more than 0.05 percent.
  These assigned values, which of course differ in other indexes in other countries,
  are then summed and divided by 10 (the number of components). To make the
  overall measure resemble the more familiar indexes, the Board multiplies the
  result by 100.
      A simple numerical example will help explain. Say, for ease of exposition, the
  indicator has only four component parts: stock prices, money growth, orders,
  and consumer confidence. In one month, stock prices rise 2.0 percent, money
  growth rises 1.0 percent, orders are flat, and consumer confidence falls by 0.6
  percent. Using The Conference Board’s assigned values, these would contribute
  respectively: 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0 to create a numerator of 2.5. When divided by
  four (the number of components) and multiplied by 100, it generates an indicator
  of 62.5 for that month.
      Assume that the following month stock prices fall 0.8 percent, money grows
  by 0.5 percent, orders pick up 0.5 percent, and consumer confidence grows 3.5
  percent. Applying the appropriate values, the components would add to 0 +
  1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 3.0. Divided by the number of components and multiplied by

                            100, it yields an index value of 75. The 20.0 percent increase in the index value
                            means more components of the composite index are rising. Given this result,
                            an analyst can be more confident that the higher composite index value actually
                            represents broader movements in the economy. In general, a diffusion index does
                            not reflect outliers in any component (like a straight arithmetic mean would
                            do) but instead tries to capture the overall change common to all components.


                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Leading, lagging, and coincident indicators are:
                                A. the same worldwide.
                                B. based on historical cyclical observations.
                                C. based on Keynesian or Monetarist theory.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. The recognition of economic indicators is based on empirical
                               observations for an economy.

                            2. A diffusion index:
                                A. measures growth.
                                B. reflects the consensus change in economic indicators.
                                C. is roughly analogous to the indexes used to measure industrial
                                   production.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. The diffusion indexes are constructed to reflect the common
                               trends embedded in the movements of all the indicators included in such an
                               index.

                            3. In the morning business news, a financial analyst, Kevin Durbin, learned
                               that average hourly earnings had increased last month. The most appropri-
                               ate action for Durbin is to:
                                A. call his clients to inform them of a good trading opportunity today.
                                B. examine other leading indicators to see any confirmation of a possible
                                   turning point for the economy.
                                C. use the news in his research report as a confirmation for his belief that
                                   the economy has recovered from a recession.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Financial analysts need to synthesize the information from vari-
                               ous indicators in order to gather a reliable reading of the economic trends.

                            4. The following table shows the trends in various economic indicators in the

    Change in unit labor costs                        Rising

     Given the information, this economy is most likely experiencing a:
      A. continuing recession.
      B. peak in the business cycle.
      C. strong recovery out of a trough.
     Solution:
     B is correct. The first three indicators are leading indicators, and all of them
     are indicating an impending recession, which means the economy has
     reached the peak in this cycle. Non-agricultural payrolls and manufacturing
     and trade sales are coincident indicators. The trends in these two variables
     further indicate that the economy may begin to decline. The trends in the
     last two indicators—both lagging indicators—indicate that the economy
     may either continue to grow or it may be close to a peak. Aggregating the
     signals given by all three groups of economic indicators, it appears the econ-
     omy may be near the peak of a business cycle.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                         1. Based on typical labor utilization patterns across the business cycle, productivity
                            (output per hours worked) is most likely to be highest:
                             A. at the peak of a boom.

                             B. into a maturing expansion.

                             C. at the bottom of a recession.

                         2. As the expansion phase of the business cycle advances from early stage to late
                            stage, businesses most likely experience a decrease in:
                             A. labor costs.

                             B. capital investment.

                             C. availability of qualified workers.

                         3. An analyst writes in an economic report that the current phase of the business
                            cycle is characterized by accelerating inflationary pressures and borrowing by
                            companies. The analyst is most likely referring to the:
                             A. peak of the business cycle.

                             B. contraction phase of the business cycle.

                             C. early expansion phase of the business cycle.

                         4. The indicator indexes created by various organizations or research agencies:
                             A. include only leading indicators to compute their value.

                             B. are highly reliable signals on the phase of business cycles.

                             C. evolve over time in terms of composition and computation formula.

                         5. Which one of the following trends in various economic indicators is most consis-
                            tent with a recovery from a recession?
                             A. A declining inventory–sales ratio and stable industrial production index

                             B. A rising broad stock market index and unit labor costs turning from
                                increasing to decreasing

                             C. A decrease in average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance and
                                an increase in aggregate real personal income

                         6. Which of the following statements gives the best description of nowcasting?
                             A. This method is used to forecast future trends in economic variables based
                                on their past and current values.

                             B. This method is used for real-time monitoring of economic and financial
                                variables to continuously assess current conditions and provide an estimate
                                of the current state.

   C. This method is used to study past relationships between variables to deter-
      mine which ones have explained the path of a particular variable of interest.

7. Which of the following statements is the best description of the characteristics of
   economic indicators?
   A. Leading indicators are important because they track the entire economy.

   B. Lagging indicators, in measuring past conditions, do not require revisions.

   C. A combination of leading and coincident indicators can offer effective
      forecasts.

8. When the spread between 10-year US Treasury yields and the short-term federal
   funds rate narrows and at the same time the prime rate stays unchanged, this mix
   of indicators most likely forecasts future economic:
   A. growth.

   B. decline.

   C. stability.

9. Current economic statistics indicating little change in services inflation, rising
   residential building permits, and increasing average duration of unemployment
   are best interpreted as:
   A. conflicting evidence about the direction of the economy.

   B. evidence that a cyclical upturn is expected to occur in the future.

   C. evidence that a cyclical downturn is expected to occur in the future.

10. If relative to prior values of their respective indicators, the inventory–sales ratio
    has risen, unit labor cost is stable, and real personal income has decreased, it is
    most likely that a peak in the business cycle:
   A. has occurred.

   B. is just about to occur.

   C. will occur sometime in the future.

11. When aggregate real personal income, industrial output, and the S&P 500 Index
    all increase in a given period, it is most accurate to conclude that a cyclical up-
    turn is:
   A. occurring.

   B. about to end.

   C. about to begin.

12. Which of the following is most likely to increase after an increase in aggregate
    real personal income?
   A. Equity prices

   B. Building permits for new private housing units

                             C. The ratio of consumer installment debt to income

                         13. Which of the following indicators is most appropriate in predicting a turning
                             point in the economy?
                             A. The Industrial Production Index

                             B. The average bank prime lending rate

                             C. Average weekly hours, manufacturing

                         14. The unemployment rate is considered a lagging indicator because:
                             A. new job types must be defined to count their workers.

                             B. multiworker households change jobs at a slower pace.

                             C. businesses are slow to hire and fire due to related costs.

                         15. During an economic recovery, a lagging unemployment rate is most likely attrib-
                             utable to:
                             A. businesses quickly rehiring workers.

                             B. new job seekers entering the labor force.

                             C. underemployed workers transitioning to higher-paying jobs.

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. At the end of a recession, firms will run “lean production” to gener-
   ate maximum output with the fewest number of workers.

2. C is correct. When an economy’s expansion is well established, businesses often
   have difficulty finding qualified workers.

3. A is correct. Accelerating inflation and rapidly expanding capital expenditures
   typically characterize the peak of the business cycle. During such times, many
   businesses finance their capital expenditures with debt to expand their produc-
   tion capacity.

4. C is correct. The indicator indexes are constantly updated for their composition
   and methodology based on the accumulation of empirical knowledge, and they
   can certainly include more than just leading indicators.

5. C is correct. The improving leading indicator, average weekly initial claims for
   unemployment insurance, and the improving coincident indicator, aggregate real
   personal income, are most consistent with an economic recovery. Even though a
   declining inventory-to-sales ratio, a lagging indicator, is consistent with an early
   recovery, the coincident indicator, the stable industrial production index, does
   not support that conclusion. Although a rising stock market index can signal eco-
   nomic expansion, the lagging indicator, the unit labor costs, has peaked, which is
   more consistent with a recession.

6. B is correct. Nowcasting involves the use of techniques to estimate the present
   state. A is incorrect because nowcasting aims to estimate the present, not fore-
   cast the future. C is incorrect because the focus of nowcasting is to estimate the
   current, present value of a variable, such as GDP.

7. C is correct. Although no single indicator is definitive, a mix of them—which can
   be affected by various economic determinants—can offer the strongest signal of
   performance.

8. B is correct. The narrowing spread of this leading indicator foretells a drop in
   short-term rates and a fall in economic activity. The prime rate is a lagging indi-
   cator and typically moves after the economy turns.

9. B is correct. Rising building permits—a leading indicator—indicate that an
   upturn is expected to occur or continue. Increasing average duration of un-
   employment—a lagging indicator—indicates that a downturn has occurred,
   whereas the lack of any change in services inflation—also a lagging indicator—is
   neither negative nor positive for the direction of the economy. Taken together,
   these statistics indicate that a cyclical upturn may be expected to occur.

10. A is correct. Both inventory–sales and unit labor costs are lagging indicators that
    decline somewhat after a peak. Real personal income is a coincident indicator
    that, by its decline, shows a slowdown in business activity.

11. A is correct. Aggregate real personal income and industrial output are coincident
    indicators, whereas the S&P 500 is a leading indicator. An increase in aggregate
    personal income and industrial output signals that an expansion is occurring,
    whereas an increase in the S&P 500 signals that an expansion will occur or is ex-
    pected to continue. Taken together, these statistics indicate that a cyclical upturn
    is occurring.

                         12. C is correct. Aggregate real personal income is a coincident indicator of the
                             business cycle, and the ratio of consumer installment debt to income is a lagging
                             indicator. Increases in the ratio of consumer installment debt follow increases in
                             average aggregate income during the typical business cycle.

                         13. C is correct. Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually
                             precede those of the overall economy. Average weekly hours, manufacturing is a
                             leading economic indicator. The Industrial Production Index is a coincident eco-
                             nomic indicator, and the average bank prime lending rate is a lagging economic
                             indicator.

                         14. C is correct. This effect makes unemployment rise more slowly as recessions start
                             and fall more slowly as recoveries begin.

                         15. B is correct. In an economic recovery, new job seekers return to the labor force,
                             and because they seldom find work immediately, their return may initially raise
                             the unemployment rate.

INTRODUCTION
Fiscal policy refers to the government’s decisions about taxation and spending,
                                                                                         1
whereas monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward
influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. Fiscal policy involves the
use of government spending and changing tax revenue to affect certain aspects of the
economy, such as the overall level of aggregate demand. Government deficits are the
difference between government revenues and expenditures over a period of calendar
time. The fiscal tools available to a government include transfer payments, current
government spending, capital expenditures, and taxes. Economists often examine the
structural budget deficit as an indicator of a government’s fiscal stance.

                                ■   The primary goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is the creation of
                                    an economic environment in which growth is stable and positive, and
                                    inflation is stable and low.
                                ■   Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and changing
                                    tax revenue to affect certain aspects of the economy, including the
                                    level of economic activity in an economy, the distribution of income

                                ■   The budget surplus/deficit is the difference between government
                                    revenue and expenditure for a fixed period of time, such as a fiscal or
                                    calendar year.
                                ■   There are several strong arguments both for and against being con-
                                    cerned about national debt relative to GDP.
                                ■   The fiscal tools available to a government include transfer payments,
                                    current government spending, capital expenditures, direct taxes, and
                                    indirect taxes.
                                ■   Taxes can be justified both in terms of raising revenues to finance
                                    expenditures and in terms of income and wealth redistribution
                                    policies.
                                ■   Fiscal policy tools seek to achieve or maintain an economy on a path
                                    of positive, stable growth with low inflation.
                                ■   Economists assess the structural (or cyclically adjusted) budget deficit
                                    as an indicator of the government’s fiscal stance, which is defined as
                                    the deficit that would exist if the economy was at full employment.
                                ■   Actual government deficits may not be a good measure of fiscal stance
                                    because of the distinction between real and nominal interest rates and
                                    the role of inflation adjustment when applied to budget deficits.
                                ■   Fiscal policy cannot stabilize aggregate demand completely because
                                    the difficulties in executing fiscal policy cannot be completely
                                    overcome.

                         The economic decisions of households can have a significant impact on an economy.
                         For example, a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less
                         can lead to an increase in employment, investment, and ultimately profits. Equally, the
                         investment decisions made by corporations can have an important impact on the real
                         economy and on corporate profits. But individual corporations can rarely affect large
                         economies on their own; the decisions of a single household concerning consumption
                         will have a negligible impact on the wider economy.
                             By contrast, the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact
                         on even the largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons. First, the
                         public sectors of most developed economies normally employ a significant propor-
                         tion of the population, and they usually are responsible for a significant proportion

    Government policy is ultimately expressed through its borrowing and spending
activities. In this reading, we identify and discuss two types of government policy that
can affect the macroeconomy and financial markets: monetary policy and fiscal policy.
    Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influenc-
ing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. Central banks can implement
monetary policy almost completely independent of government interference and
influence at one end of the scale or may simply act as the agent of the government at
the other end of the scale.

                             By contrast, fiscal policy refers to the government’s decisions about taxation and
                         spending. Both monetary and fiscal policies are used to regulate economic activity
                         over time. They can be used to accelerate growth when an economy starts to slow or
                         to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat. In addition,
                         fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth.
                             The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation
                         of an economic environment in which growth is stable and positive and inflation is
                         stable and low. Crucially, the aim is to steer the underlying economy so that it does
                         not experience economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or
                         negative growth and high levels of unemployment. In such a stable economic envi-
                         ronment, households can feel secure in their consumption and saving decisions, while
                         corporations can concentrate on their investment decisions, on making their regular
                         coupon payments to their bond holders, and on making profits for their shareholders.
                             The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many. Economies frequently
                         are buffeted by shocks (such as oil price jumps), and some economists believe that
                         natural cycles in the economy also exist. Moreover, we can find plenty of examples
                         from history in which government policies—either monetary, fiscal, or both—have
                         exacerbated an economic expansion that eventually led to damaging consequences
                         for the real economy, for financial markets, and for investors.

                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Which of the following statements best describes monetary policy?
                               Monetary policy:
                               A. involves the setting of medium-term targets for broad money
                                  aggregates.
                               B. involves the manipulation by a central bank of the government’s bud-
                                  get deficit.
                                C. seeks to influence the macroeconomy by influencing the quantity of
                                   money and credit in the economy.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct, as monetary policy involves central bank activities directed
                               toward influencing the quantity of money and credit. Choice A is incorrect
                               because, although the setting of targets for monetary aggregates is a possible
                               tool of monetary policy, monetary policy itself is concerned with influencing
                               the overall, or macro, economy.

                            2. Which of the following statements best describes fiscal policy? Fiscal policy:
                               A. is used by governments to redistribute wealth and incomes.
                               B. is the attempt by governments to balance their budgets from one year
                                  to the next.
                                C. involves the use of government spending and taxation to influence
                                   economy activity.
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Note that governments may wish to use fiscal policy to redis-
                               tribute income and balance their budgets, but the overriding goal of fiscal
                               policy is usually to influence a broader range of economic activity.

ROLES AND OBJECTIVES OF FISCAL POLICY
                                                                                         3
             describe roles and objectives of fiscal policy as well as arguments as
             to whether the size of a national debt relative to GDP matters

Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and changing tax revenue to
affect a number of aspects of the economy:
   ■   Overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of
       economic activity.
   ■   Distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the
       population.
   ■   Allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents.
    The discussion of fiscal policy often focuses on the impact of changes in the dif-
ference between government spending and revenue on the aggregate economy, rather
than on the actual levels of spending and revenue themselves.


Roles and Objectives of Fiscal Policy
A primary aim for fiscal policy is to help manage the economy through its influence
on aggregate national output, that is, real GDP.

Fiscal Policy and Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand is the amount companies and households plan to spend. We can
consider a number of ways that fiscal policy can influence aggregate demand. For
example, an expansionary policy could take one or more of the following forms:
   ■   Cuts in personal income tax raise disposable income with the objective of
       boosting aggregate demand.
   ■   Cuts in sales (indirect) taxes to lower prices raise real incomes with the
       objective of raising consumer demand.
   ■   Cuts in corporation (company) taxes to boost business profits may raise
       capital spending.
   ■   Cuts in tax rates on personal savings to raise disposable income for those
       with savings, with the objective of raising consumer demand.
   ■   New public spending on social goods and infrastructure, such as hospitals
       and schools, boost personal incomes with the objective of raising aggregate
       demand.
    We must stress, however, that the reliability and magnitude of these relationships
will vary over time and from country to country. For example, in a recession with
rising unemployment, it is not always the case that cuts in income taxes will raise
consumer spending because consumers may wish to raise their precautionary (rainy
day) saving in anticipation of further deterioration in the economy. Indeed, in very
general terms, economists are often divided into two camps regarding the workings
of fiscal policy. Keynesians believe that fiscal policy can have powerful effects on
aggregate demand, output, and employment when there is substantial spare capacity
in an economy. Monetarists believe that fiscal changes only have a temporary effect
on aggregate demand and that monetary policy is a more effective tool for restraining
or boosting inflationary pressures. Monetarists tend not to advocate using monetary
policy for countercyclical adjustment of aggregate demand. This intellectual division

                         naturally will be reflected in economists’ divergent views on the efficacy of the large
                         fiscal expansions observed in many countries following the 2008–2009 Global Financial
                         Crisis, along with differing views on the possible impact of quantitative easing.

                         Government Receipts and Expenditure in Major Economies
                         In Exhibit 1, we present the total government revenues as a percentage of GDP for
                         some major economies. This is the share of a country’s output that is gathered by the
                         government through taxes and such related items as fees, charges, fines, and capital
                         transfers. It is often considered as a summary measure of the extent to which a gov-
                         ernment is involved both directly and indirectly in the economic activity of a country.
                             Taxes are formally defined as compulsory, unrequited payments to the general
                         government (they are unrequited in the sense that benefits provided by a government
                         to taxpayers usually are not related to payments). Exhibit 1 contains taxes on incomes
                         and profits, social security contributions, indirect taxes on goods and services, employ-
                         ment taxes, and taxes on the ownership and transfer of property.

                         Taxes on income and profits have been fairly constant for the member countries of
                         the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) at around
                         12.5–13 percent of GDP since the mid-1990s, while taxes on goods and services have
                         been steady at about 11 percent of GDP for that period. Variations between countries
                         can be substantial; taxes on goods and services are around 5 percent of GDP for the
                         United States and Japan but are more than 16 percent for Denmark.
                             Exhibit 2 shows the percentage of GDP represented by government expenditure
                         in a variety of major economies over time. Generally, these have been fairly constant
                         since 1995, although Germany had a particularly high number at the start of the
                         period because of reunification costs. The impacts of governments’ fiscal stimulus
                         programs in the face of the 2008–2009 financial crisis show up as significant increases
                         in government expenditures in Exhibit 2 and increases in government deficits between
                         2008 and 2010 are evident in Exhibit 3.

Clearly, the possibility that fiscal policy can influence output means that it may be
an important tool for economic stabilization. In a recession, governments can raise
spending (expansionary fiscal policy) in an attempt to raise employment and output.
In boom times—when an economy has full employment and wages and prices are
rising too fast—government spending may be reduced and taxes raised (contraction-
ary fiscal policy).
    Hence, a key concept is the budget surplus or deficit, which is the positive or
negative difference between government revenue and expenditure for a fixed period
of time, such as a fiscal or calendar year. Government revenue includes tax revenues
net of transfer payments; government spending includes interest payments on the
government debt. Analysts often focus on changes in the budget surplus or deficit
from year to year as indicators of whether the fiscal policy is getting tighter or looser.
An increase in a budget surplus would be associated with contractionary fiscal policy,
while a rise in a deficit is an expansionary fiscal policy. Of course, over the course of
a business cycle, the budget surplus will vary automatically in a countercyclical way.
For example, as an economy slows and unemployment rises, government spending
on social insurance and unemployment benefits will also rise and add to aggregate
demand. This is known as an automatic stabilizer. Similarly, if boom conditions ensue
and employment and incomes are high, then progressive income and profit taxes are
rising and also act as automatic stabilizers increasing budget surplus or reducing
budget deficit. The great advantage of automatic stabilizers is that they are automatic
and do not require the identification of shocks to which policy makers must consider
a response. By reducing the responsiveness of the economy to shocks, these automatic
stabilizers reduce output fluctuations. Automatic stabilizers should be distinguished
from discretionary fiscal policies, such as changes in government spending or tax
rates, which are actively used to stabilize aggregate demand. If government spending
and revenues are equal, then the budget is balanced.

                            the United Kingdom
                            The precise components of revenue and expenditure will of course vary over time
                            and between countries. But, as an example of the breakdown of expenditure and
                            revenue, in Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5 we have presented the budget projections of
                            the United Kingdom for 2018/2019. The budget projected that total spending
                            would come to GBP808 billion, whereas total revenue would be only GBP769
                            billion. The government was therefore forecasting a budget shortfall of GBP39
                            billion for the fiscal year, meaning that it had an associated need to borrow
                            GBP39 billion from the private sector in the United Kingdom or the private and
                            public sectors of other economies.

QUESTION SET


  1. The least likely goal of a government’s fiscal policy is to:
      A. redistribute income and wealth.
      B. influence aggregate national output.
      C. ensure the stability of the purchasing power of its currency.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Ensuring stable purchasing power is a goal of monetary rather
     than fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and
     tax revenue to affect the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy
     and hence the level of economic activity.

  2. Which of the following best represents a contractionary fiscal policy?
      A. Temporary suspension of payroll taxes
      B. Public spending on a high-speed railway
      C. Freeze in discretionary government spending
     Solution:
     C is correct. A freeze in discretionary government spending is an example of
     a contractionary fiscal policy.

  3. A “pay-as-you-go” rule, which requires that any tax cut or increase in
     entitlement spending be offset by an increase in other taxes or reduction in
     other entitlement spending, is an example of which fiscal policy stance?
      A. Neutral

                                  B. Expansionary
                                   C. Contractionary
                                  Solution:
                                  A is correct. A “pay-as-you-go” rule is a neutral policy because any increases
                                  in spending or reductions in revenues would be offset. Accordingly, there
                                  would be no net impact on the budget deficit/surplus.



                         Deficits and the National Debt
                         Government deficits are the difference between government revenues and expendi-
                         tures over a period of calendar time, usually a year. Government (or national) debt
                         is the accumulation over time of these deficits. Government deficits are financed by
                         borrowing from the private sector, often through private pension and insurance fund
                         portfolio investments. We read that governments are more likely to have deficits than
                         surpluses over long periods of time. As a result, a large stock of outstanding govern-
                         ment debt may be owned by the private sector. This will vary as the business cycle
                         ebbs and flows. Exhibit 6 shows the time path of the ratio of public debt to GDP for
                         the United Kingdom over several hundred years. It can be clearly seen that the major
                         cause of fluctuations in that ratio through history has been the financing of wars, in
                         particular the Napoleonic Wars of 1799–1815 and the First and Second World Wars
                         of 1914–1918 and 1939–1945.

                         With the onset of the credit crisis of 2008, governments actively sought to stimulate
                         their economies through increased expenditures without raising taxes and revenues.
                         This led to increased borrowing, shown in Exhibit 7, which became a concern in the

financial markets in 2010 for such countries as Greece. Indeed, between 2008 and
2009, according to the OECD, central government debt rose from USD1.2 trillion to
USD1.6 trillion in the United Kingdom and from USD5.8 trillion to USD7.5 trillion
for the United States. The fiscal expansion by governments in the face of the financial
crisis seems to have significantly raised the general government debt-to-GDP ratio
over the long term for many countries, as illustrated in Exhibit 7.

Ultimately, if the ratio of debt to GDP rises beyond a certain unknown point, then
the solvency of the country comes into question. An additional indicator for potential
insolvency is the ratio of interest rate payments to GDP, which is shown for some
major economies in Exhibit 8. These represent payments required of governments
to service their debts as a percentage of national output and, as such, reflect both the
size of debts and the interest charged on them.

Government spending was far in excess of revenues following the credit crisis of
2007–2010 as governments tried to stimulate their economies; this level of spending
raised concerns in some quarters about the scale of governmental debt accumula-
tion. Exhibit 7 shows that government debt relative to GDP for the OECD countries
overall rose from 59.5 percent in 2005 to 85.3 percent in 2015. In Japan, where fiscal
spending has been used to stimulate the economy from the early 1990s, the ratio has
risen from 94.7 percent in 1995 to 237.4 percent in 2015. If an economy grows in real
terms, so do the real tax revenues and hence the ability to service a growing real debt
at constant tax rate levels. If, however, the real growth in the economy is lower than
the real interest rate on the debt, then the debt ratio will worsen even though the
economy is growing because the debt burden (i.e., the real interest rate times the debt)

                         grows faster than the economy. Hence, an important issue for governments and their
                         creditors is whether their additional spending leads to sufficiently higher tax revenues
                         to pay the interest on the debt used to finance the extra spending.
                              However, within a national economy, the real value of the outstanding debt will
                         fall if the overall price level rises (i.e., inflation, and hence a rise in nominal GDP
                         even if real GDP is static) and thus the ratio of debt to GDP may not be rising. If the
                         general price level falls (i.e., deflation), then the ratio may stay elevated for longer.
                         If net interest payments rise rapidly and investors lose confidence in a government’s
                         ability to honor its debts, then financing costs may escalate even more quickly and
                         make the situation unstable.
                              Should we be concerned about the size of a national debt (relative to GDP)? There
                         are strong arguments both for and against:
                             ■   The arguments against being concerned about national debt (relative to
                                 GDP) are as follows:

                                 ●   The scale of the problem may be overstated because the debt is owed
                                     internally to fellow citizens. This is certainly the case in Japan and South
                                     Korea, where 93 percent is owned by local residents. Canada is similar
                                     with 90 percent of debt is owned by residents. However, other countries
                                     have a much lower percentage owned internally. According to data from
                                     the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and International Monetary
                                     Fund (IMF), the figures are 53 percent and 73 percent in the United
                                     States and United Kingdom, respectively, whereas in Italy, only 46 per-
                                     cent is owned by local residents.
                                 ●   A proportion of the money borrowed may have been used for capital
                                     investment projects or to enhance human capital (e.g., training, educa-
                                     tion); these should lead to raised future output and tax revenues.
                                 ●   Large fiscal deficits require tax changes that actually may reduce distor-
                                     tions caused by existing tax structures.
                                 ●   Deficits may have no net impact because the private sector may act
                                     to offset fiscal deficits by increasing saving in anticipation of future
                                     increased taxes. This argument is known as “Ricardian equivalence” and
                                     is discussed in more detail later.
                                 ●   If there is unemployment in an economy, then the debt is not diverting
                                     activity away from productive uses (and indeed the debt could be associ-
                                     ated with an increase in employment).
                             ■   The arguments in favor of being concerned about national debt are as
                                 follows:

                                 ●   High levels of debt to GDP may lead to higher tax rates in the search for
                                     higher tax revenues. This may lead to disincentives to economic activity
                                     as the higher marginal tax rates reduce labor effort and entrepreneurial
                                     activity, leading to lower growth in the long run.
                                 ●   If markets lose confidence in a government, then the central bank may
                                     have to print money to finance a government deficit. This ultimately may
                                     lead to high inflation, as evidenced by the economic history of Germany
                                     in the 1920s and more recently in Zimbabwe.
                                 ●   Government borrowing may divert private sector investment from tak-
                                     ing place (an effect known as crowding out); if there is a limited amount
                                     of savings to be spent on investment, then larger government demands
                                     will lead to higher interest rates and lower private sector investing.

Roles and Objectives of Fiscal Policy                                                        91


    An important distinction to make is between long- and short-run effects. Over
short periods of time (say, a few years), crowding out may have little effect. If it lasts
for a longer time, however, then capital accumulation in an economy may be damaged.
Similarly, tax distortions may not be too serious over the short term but will have a
more substantial impact over many years.

QUESTION SET


   1. Which of the following is not associated with an expansionary fiscal
      policy?
      A. Rise in capital gains taxes
      B. Cuts in personal income taxes
       C. New capital spending by the government on road building
      Solution:
      A is correct. A rise in capital gains taxes reduces income available for
      spending and hence reduces aggregate demand, other things being equal.
      Cutting income tax raises disposable income, while new road building raises
      employment and incomes; in both cases, aggregate demand rises and hence
      policy is expansionary.

   2. Fiscal expansions will most likely have the greatest impact on aggregate out-
      put when the economy is in which of the following states?
      A. Full employment
      B. Near full employment
       C. Considerable unemployment
      Solution:
      C is correct. When an economy is close to full employment, a fiscal expan-
      sion raising aggregate demand can have little impact on output because
      there are few spare unused resources (e.g., labor or idle factories); instead,
      there will be upward pressure on prices (i.e., inflation). The greatest impact
      on aggregate output will occur when there is considerable unemployment.

   3. Which one of the following is most likely a reason to not use fiscal deficits as
      an expansionary tool?
      A. They may crowd out private investment.
      B. They may facilitate tax changes to reduce distortions in an economy.
       C. They may stimulate employment when there is substantial unemploy-
          ment in an economy.
      Solution:
      A is correct. A frequent argument against raises in fiscal deficits is that the
      additional borrowing to fund the deficit in financial markets will displace
      private sector borrowing for investment (i.e., crowding out).

   4. The most likely argument against high national debt levels is that:
      A. the debt is owed internally to fellow citizens.
      B. they create disincentives for economic activity.

                                  C. they may finance investment in physical and human capital.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. The belief is that high levels of debt to GDP may lead to higher
                                 future tax rates, which may lead to disincentives to economic activity.

                            5. Which statement regarding fiscal deficits is most accurate?
                                 A. According to the Ricardian equivalence, deficits have a multiplicative
                                    effect on consumer spending.
                                 B. Higher government spending may lead to higher interest rates and
                                    lower private sector investing.
                                  C. Central bank actions that grow the money supply to address deflation-
                                     ary conditions decrease fiscal deficits.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. Government borrowing may compete with private sector bor-
                                 rowing for investment purposes.




             4           FISCAL POLICY TOOLS

                                         describe tools of fiscal policy, including their advantages and
                                         disadvantages

                         We now look at the nature of the fiscal tools available to a government. Government
                         spending can take a variety of forms:
                             ■    Transfer payments are welfare payments made through the social security
                                  system and, depending on the country, include payments for state pen-
                                  sions, housing benefits, tax credits and income support for poorer families,
                                  child benefits, unemployment benefits, and job search allowances. Transfer
                                  payments exist to provide a basic minimum level of income for low-in-
                                  come households, and they also provide a means by which a government
                                  can change the overall income distribution in a society. Note that these
                                  payments are not included in the definition of GDP because they do not
                                  reflect a reward to a factor of production for economic activity. Also, they
                                  are not considered to be part of general government spending on goods and
                                  services.
                             ■    Current government spending involves spending on goods and services
                                  that are provided on a regular, recurring basis—including health, education,
                                  and defense. Clearly, such spending will have a big impact on a country’s
                                  skill level and overall labor productivity.
                             ■    Capital expenditure includes infrastructure spending on roads, hospitals,
                                  prisons, and schools. This investment spending will add to a nation’s capital
                                  stock and affect productive potential for an economy.
                             Government spending can be justified on both economic and social grounds:
                             ■    To provide such services as defense that benefit all citizens equally.
                             ■    For infrastructure capital spending (e.g., roads) to help a country’s economic

    ■   To guarantee a minimum level of income for poorer people and hence redis-
        tribute income and wealth (e.g., welfare and related benefits).
    ■   To influence a government’s economic objectives of low inflation and high
        employment and growth (e.g., management of aggregate demand).
    ■   To subsidize the development of innovative and high-risk new products or
        markets (e.g., alternative energy sources).
    Government revenues can take several forms:
    ■   Direct taxes are levied on income, wealth, and corporate profits and include
        capital gains taxes, national insurance (or labor) taxes, and corporate taxes.
        They also may include a local income or property tax for both individuals
        and businesses. Inheritance tax on a deceased’s estate will have both reve-
        nue-raising and wealth-redistribution aspects.
    ■   Indirect taxes are taxes on spending on a variety of goods and services in
        an economy—such as the excise duties on fuel, alcohol, and tobacco as well
        as sales (or value-added tax)—and often exclude health and education prod-
        ucts on social grounds. In addition, taxes on gambling may be considered to
        have a social aspect in deterring such activity, while fuel duties will serve an
        environmental purpose by making fuel consumption and hence travel more
        expensive.
    Taxes can be justified both in terms of raising revenues to finance expenditures and
in terms of income and wealth redistribution policies. Economists typically consider
four desirable attributes of a tax policy:
    ■   Simplicity: This refers to ease of compliance by the taxpayer and enforce-
        ment by the revenue authorities. The final liability should be certain and not
        easily manipulated.
    ■   Efficiency: Taxation should interfere as little as possible in the choices
        individuals make in the marketplace. Taxes affect behavior and should,
        in general, discourage work and investment as little as possible. A major
        philosophical issue among economists is whether tax policy should delib-
        erately deviate from efficiency to promote “good” economic activities, such
        as savings, and discourage harmful ones, such as tobacco consumption.
        Although most would accept a limited role in guiding consumer choices,
        some will question if policy makers are equipped to decide on such objec-
        tives and whether there will be unwanted ancillary effects, such as giving tax
        breaks for saving among people who already save and whose behavior does
        not change.
    ■   Fairness: This refers to the fact that people in similar situations should pay
        the same taxes (“horizontal equity”) and that richer people should pay more
        taxes (“vertical equity”). Of course, the concept of fairness is really subjec-
        tive. Still, most would agree that income tax rates should be progressive—
        that is, that households and corporations should pay proportionately more
        as their incomes rise. However, some people advocate “flat” tax rates,
        whereby all should pay the same proportion of taxable income.
    ■   Revenue sufficiency: Although revenue sufficiency may seem obvious as a
        criterion for tax policy, there may be a conflict with fairness and efficiency.
        For example, one may believe that increasing income tax rates to reduce
        fiscal deficits reduces labor effort and that tax rate increases are thus an
        inefficient policy tool.

                          SOME ISSUES WITH TAX POLICY

                               1. Incentives. Some economists believe that income taxes reduce the
                                  incentive to work, save, and invest and that the overall tax burden has
                                  become excessive. These ideas are often associated with supply-side
                                  economics and the US economist Arthur Laffer. A variety of income
                                  tax cuts and simplifications have taken place in the United States since
                                  1981, and despite substantial controversy, some claim that work effort
                                  did rise (although tax cuts had little impact on savings). Similarly,
                                  some found that business investment did rise, while others claimed it
                                  was independent of such cuts.
                               2. Fairness. How do we judge the fairness of the tax system? One way
                                  is to calibrate the tax burden falling on different groups of people
                                  ranked by their income and to assess how changes in taxes affect these
                                  groups. Of course, this imposes huge data demands on investigators
                                  and must be considered incomplete. In the United States, the federal
                                  system is indeed highly progressive. Many countries use such methods
                                  to analyze the impact of tax changes on different income groups when
                                  they announce their annual fiscal policy plans.
                               3. Tax reform. There is continuous debate on reforming tax policy.
                                  Should there be a flat-rate tax on labor income? Should all investment
                                  be immediately deducted for corporate taxes? Should more revenue
                                  be sourced from consumption taxes? Should taxes be indexed to
                                  inflation? Should dividends be taxed when profits have already been
                                  subject to tax? Should estates be taxed at all? Many of these issues are
                                  raised in the context of their impact on economic growth.


                          QUESTION SET


                            1. Which of the following is not a tool of fiscal policy?
                               A. A rise in social transfer payments
                               B. The purchase of new equipment for the armed forces
                                C. An increase in deposit requirements for the buying of houses
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Rises in deposit requirements for house purchases are intended
                               to reduce the demand for credit for house purchases and hence would be
                               considered a tool of monetary policy. This is a policy used actively in several
                               countries and is under consideration by regulators in other countries to
                               constrain house price inflation.

                            2. Which of the following is not an indirect tax?
                               A. Excise duty
                               B. Value-added tax
                                C. Employment taxes
                               Solution:
                               C is correct. Both excise duty and value-added tax (VAT) are applied to
                               prices, whereas taxes on employment apply to labor income and hence are
                               not indirect taxes.

Fiscal Policy Tools                                                                          95


   3. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
        A. Direct taxes are useful for discouraging alcohol consumption.
        B. Because indirect taxes cannot be changed quickly, they are of no use
           in fiscal policy.
         C. Government capital spending decisions are slow to plan, implement,
            and execute and hence are of little use for short-term economic
            stabilization.
        Solution:
        C is correct. Capital spending is much slower to implement than changes in
        indirect taxes; and indirect taxes affect alcohol consumption more directly
        than direct taxes.



The Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Fiscal Policy
Tools
The different tools used to expedite fiscal policy as a means to try to put or keep an
economy on a path of positive, stable growth with low inflation have both advantages
and disadvantages:

Advantages

    ■    Indirect taxes can be adjusted almost immediately after they are announced
         and can influence spending behavior instantly and generate revenue for the
         government at little or no cost to the government.
    ■    Social policies, such as discouraging alcohol or tobacco use, can be adjusted
         almost instantly by raising such taxes.


Disadvantages

    ■    Direct taxes are more difficult to change without considerable notice, often
         many months, because payroll computer systems will have to be adjusted
         (although the announcement may well have a powerful effect on spending
         behavior more immediately). The same may be said for welfare and other
         social transfers.
    ■    Capital spending plans take longer to formulate and implement, typically
         over a period of years. For example, building a road or hospital requires
         detailed planning, legal permissions, and implementation. This is often a
         valid criticism of an active fiscal policy and was widely heard during the US
         fiscal stimulus in 2009–2010. Such policies, however, do add to the produc-
         tive potential of an economy, unlike a change in personal or indirect taxes.
         Of course, the slower the impact of a fiscal change, the more likely other
         exogenous changes will already be influencing the economy before the fiscal
         change kicks in.
    These tools may have expectational effects at least as powerful as the direct effects.
The announcement of future income tax rises a year ahead potentially could lead to
reduced consumption immediately. Such delayed tax rises were a feature of the UK
fiscal policy of 2009–2010; however, the evidence is anecdotal because spending
behavior changed little until the delayed tax changes actually came into force.
    We may also consider the relative potency of the different fiscal tools. Direct
government spending has a far bigger impact on aggregate spending and output than
income tax cuts or transfer increases; however, if the latter are directed at the poorest

                         in society (basically, those who spend all their income), then this will give a relatively
                         strong boost. Further discussion and examples of these comparisons are given in the
                         section on the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy.


                         Modeling the Impact of Taxes and Government Spending: The
                         Fiscal Multiplier
                         The conventional macroeconomic model has government spending, G, adding directly
                         to aggregate demand, AD, and reducing it via taxes, T; these include both indirect taxes
                         on expenditures and direct taxes on factor incomes. Further government spending is
                         increased through the payment of transfer benefits, B, such as social security payments.
                         Hence, the net impact of the government sector on aggregate demand is as follows:
                             G – T + B = Budget surplus OR deficit.
                         Net taxes (NT; taxes less transfers) reduce disposable income (YD) available to indi-
                         viduals relative to national income or output (Y) as follows:
                             YD = Y – NT = (1 – t) Y,
                         where t is the net tax rate. Net taxes are often assumed to be proportional to national
                         income, Y, and hence total tax revenue from net taxes is tY. If t = 20% or 0.2, then
                         for every USD1 rise in national income, net tax revenue will rise by USD0.20 and
                         household disposable income will rise by USD0.80.
                             The fiscal multiplier is important in macroeconomics because it tells us how much
                         output changes as exogenous changes occur in government spending or taxation.
                         The recipients of the increase in government spending will typically save a propor-
                         tion (1 – c) of each additional dollar of disposable income, where c is the marginal
                         propensity to consume (MPC) this additional income. Ignoring income taxes, we
                         can see that $c will, in turn, be spent by these recipients on more goods and services.
                         The recipients of this $c also will spend a proportion c of this additional income (i.e.,
                         $c × c, or c-squared). This process continues with income and spending growing at
                         a constant rate of c as it passes from hand to hand through the economy. This is the
                         familiar geometric progression with constant factor c, where 0 < c < 1. The sum of
                         this geometric series is 1/(1 – c).
                             We define s as the marginal propensity to save (MPS), the amount saved out of
                         an additional dollar of disposable income. Because c + s = 1, s =1 – c.



                           Exhibit 9: Disposable Income, Saving, and the MPC

                                                              Disposable
                             Income         Income Tax          Income          Consumption            Saving
                             USD100            USD20            USD80              USD72                USD8

                         In Exhibit 9, the MPC out of disposable income is 90 percent or 0.9 (72/80). The MPS
                         is therefore 1 – 0.9 or 0.1.
                             For every dollar of new (additional) spending, total incomes and spending rises
                         by USD1/(1 – c). And because 0 < c < 1, this must be > 1; this is the multiplier. If c
                         = 0.9 (or individuals spend 90 percent of additions to income), then the multiplier =
                         1/(1 – 0.9) = 10.
                             A formal definition of the multiplier would be the ratio of the change in equilib-
                         rium output to the change in autonomous spending that caused the change. This is
                         a monetary measure, but because prices are assumed to be constant in this analysis,
                         real and monetary amounts are identical. Given that fiscal policy is about changes

Fiscal Policy Tools                                                                           97


in government spending, G, net taxes, NT, and tax rates, t, we can see that the mul-
tiplier is an important tool for calibrating the possible impact of policy changes on
output. How can we introduce tax changes into the multiplier concept? We do this by
introducing the idea of disposable income, YD, defined as income less income taxes
net of transfers, Y – NT.
    Households spend a proportion c of disposable income, YD, that is, cYD or c(Y –
NT) or c(1 – t)Y. The marginal propensity to consume in the presence of taxes is then
c(1 – t). If the government increases spending, say on road building, by an amount,
G, then disposable income rises by (1 – t)G and consumer spending by c(1 – t)G.
Provided there are unused sources of capital and labor in the economy, this leads
to a rise in aggregate demand and output; the recipients of this extra consumption
spending will have (1 – t)c(1 – t)G extra disposable income available and will spend c
of it. This cumulative extra spending and income will continue to spread through the
economy at a decreasing rate as 0 < c(1 – t) < 1. The overall final impact on aggregate
demand and output will effectively be the sum of this decreasing geometric series
with the common ratio c(1 – t), which sums to 1/[1 – c(1 – t)]. This is known as the
fiscal multiplier and is relevant to studies of fiscal policy as changes in G or tax rates
will affect output in an economy through the value of the multiplier.
    For example, if the tax rate is 20 percent, or 0.2, and the marginal propensity to
consume is 90 percent, or 0.9, then the fiscal multiplier will be as follows: 1/[1 – 0.9(1
– 0.2)] or 1/0.28 = 3.57. In other words, if the government raises G by USD1 billion,
total incomes and spending rise by USD3.57 billion.
    Discretionary fiscal policy will involve changes in these variables with a view to
influencing Y.


The Balanced Budget Multiplier
If a government increases G by the same amount as it raises taxes, the aggregate
output actually rises. Why is this?
    Because the marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income is less than
1, for every dollar less in YD, spending falls only $c. Hence, aggregate spending falls
less than the tax rise by a factor of c. A balanced budget leads to a rise in output, which
in turn leads to further rises in output and incomes through the multiplier effect.
    Suppose an economy has an equilibrium output or income level of USD1,000
consisting of USD900 of consumption and USD100 of investment spending, which is
fixed and not related to income. If government spending is set at USD200, financed by
a tax rate of 20 percent (giving tax revenue of USD200), what will happen to output?
First, additional government spending of USD200 will raise output by that amount.
But taxes of USD200 will not reduce output by a similar amount if the MPC is less
than 1. Suppose it is 0.9, and hence spending will fall only by 90 percent of USD200,
or USD180. The initial impact of the balanced fiscal package on aggregate demand
will be to raise it by USD200 – USD180 = USD20. This additional output, in turn, will
lead to further increases in income and output through the multiplier effect.
    Even though this policy involved a combination of government spending and tax
increases that initially left the government’s budget deficit/surplus unchanged, the
induced rise in output will lead to further tax revenue increases and a further change
in the budget position. Could the government adjust the initial change in spending to
offset exactly the eventual total change in tax revenues? The answer is “yes,” and we
can ask what the effect will be on output of this genuinely balanced budget change.
This balanced budget multiplier always takes the value unity.

                          EXAMPLE 1

                            Government Debt, Deficits, and Ricardo Equivalence
                            The total stock of government debt is the outstanding stock of IOUs issued by
                            a government and not yet repaid. They are issued when the government has
                            insufficient tax revenues to meet expenditures and has to borrow from the
                            public. The size of the outstanding debt equals the cumulative quantity of net
                            borrowing it has done, and the fiscal or budget deficit is added in the current
                            period to the outstanding stock of debt. If the outstanding stock of debt falls,
                            we have a negative deficit or a surplus.
                                If a government reduces taxation by USD10 billion one year and replaces that
                            revenue with borrowing of USD10 billion from the public, will it have any real
                            impact on the economy? The important issue is how people perceive that action:
                            Do they recognize what will happen over time as interest and bond principal
                            have to be repaid out of future taxes? If so, they may think of the bond finance
                            as equivalent to delayed taxation finance; thus, the reduction in current taxation
                            will have no impact on spending because individuals save more in anticipation
                            of higher future taxes to repay the bond. This is called Ricardian equivalence
                            after the economist David Ricardo. If people do not correctly anticipate all the
                            future taxes required to repay the additional government debt, then they feel
                            wealthier when the debt is issued and may increase their spending, adding to
                            aggregate demand.
                                Whether Ricardian equivalence holds in practice is ultimately an empirical
                            issue and is difficult to calibrate conclusively given the number of factors that
                            are changing at any time in a modern economy.

Deficits and the Fiscal Stance
An important question is the extent to which the budget is a useful measure of the
government’s fiscal stance. Does the size of the deficit actually indicate whether fiscal
policy is expansionary or contractionary? Clearly, such a question is important for
economic policy makers insofar as the deficit can change for reasons unrelated to
actual fiscal policy changes. For example, the automatic stabilizers mentioned earlier
will lead to changes in the budget deficit unrelated to fiscal policy changes; a reces-
sion will cause tax revenues to fall and the budget deficit to rise. An observer may
conclude that fiscal policy has been loosened and is expansionary and that no further
government action is required.
    To this end, economists often look at the structural budget deficit as an indicator
of the fiscal stance. This is defined as the deficit that would exist if the economy was at
full employment (or full potential output). Hence, if we consider a period of relatively
high unemployment, such as 2009–2010 with around 9–10 percent of the workforce
out of work in the United States and Europe, then the budget deficits in those coun-
tries would be expected to be reduced substantially if the economies returned to full
employment. At this level, tax revenues would be higher and social transfers lower.
Historical data for major countries are given in Exhibit 10, where negative numbers
refer to deficits and positive numbers are surpluses.

Another reason why actual government deficits may not be a good measure of fiscal
stance is the distinction between real and nominal interest rates and the role of inflation
adjustment when applied to budget deficits. Although national economic statistics
treat the cash interest payments on debt as government expenditure, it makes more
sense to consider only the inflation-adjusted (or real) interest payments because the
real value of the outstanding debt is being eroded by inflation. Automatic stabilizers—
such as income tax, VAT, and social benefits—are important because as output and
employment fall and reduce tax revenues, net tax revenues also fall as unemployment
benefits rise. This acts as a fiscal stimulus and serves to reduce the size of the multi-
plier, dampening the output response of whatever caused the fall in output in the first
place. By their very nature, automatic stabilizers do not require policy changes; no
policy maker has to decide that an economic shock has occurred and how to respond.
Hence, the responsiveness of the economy to shocks is automatically reduced, as are
movements in employment and output.

                              In addition to these automatic adjustments, governments also use discretionary
                          fiscal adjustments to influence aggregate demand. These will involve tax changes
                          and/or spending cuts or increases usually with the aim of stabilizing the economy. A
                          natural question is why fiscal policy cannot stabilize aggregate demand completely,
                          hence ensuring full employment at all times.


                          Difficulties in Executing Fiscal Policy
                          Fiscal policy cannot stabilize aggregate demand completely because the difficulties in
                          executing fiscal policy cannot be completely overcome.
                              First, the policy maker does not have complete information about how the economy
                          functions. It may take several months for policy makers to realize that an economy is
                          slowing, because data appear with a considerable time lag and even then are subject
                          to substantial revision. This is often called the recognition lag and has been likened
                          to the problem of driving while looking in the rearview mirror. Then, when policy
                          changes are finally decided on, they may take many months to implement. This is the
                          action lag. If a government decides to raise spending on capital projects to increase
                          employment and incomes, for example, these may take many months to plan and put
                          into action. Finally, the result of these actions on the economy will take additional
                          time to become evident; this is the impact lag. These types of policy lags also occur
                          in the case of discretionary monetary policy.
                              A second aspect of time in this process is the uncertainty of where the economy
                          is heading independently of these policy changes. For example, a stimulus may occur
                          simultaneously with a surprise rise in investment spending or in the demand for a coun-
                          try’s exports just as discretionary government spending starts to rise. Macroeconomic
                          forecasting models generally do not have a good track record for accuracy and hence
                          cannot be relied on to aid the policy-making process in this context. In addition, when
                          discretionary fiscal adjustments are announced (or are already underway), private
                          sector behavior may well change, leading to rises in consumption or investment, both
                          of which will reinforce the effects of a rise in government expenditure. Again, this will
                          make it difficult to calibrate the required fiscal adjustment to secure full employment.
                              The following wider macroeconomic issues also are involved:
                              ■   If the government is concerned with both unemployment and inflation in an
                                  economy, then raising aggregate demand toward the full employment level
                                  may also lead to a tightening labor market and rising wages and prices. The
                                  policy maker may be reluctant to further fine-tune fiscal policy in an uncer-
                                  tain world because it might induce inflation.
                              ■   If the budget deficit is already large relative to GDP and further fiscal stimu-
                                  lus is required, then the necessary increase in the deficit may be considered
                                  unacceptable by the financial markets when government funding is raised,
                                  leading to higher interest rates on government debt and political pressure to
                                  tackle the deficit.
                              ■   Of course, all this presupposes that we know the level of full employment,
                                  which is difficult to measure accurately. Fiscal expansion raises demand, but
                                  what if we are already at full employment, which will be changing as pro-
                                  ductive capacity changes and workers’ willingness to work at various wage
                                  levels changes?
                              ■   If unused resources reflect a low supply of labor or other factors rather
                                  than a shortage of demand, then discretionary fiscal policy will not add to
                                  demand and will be ineffective, raising the risk of inflationary pressures in
                                  the economy.

Fiscal Policy Implementation                                                             101


   ■    The issue of crowding out may occur: If the government borrows from a
        limited pool of savings, the competition for funds with the private sector
        may crowd out private firms with subsequently less investing and economic
        growth. In addition, the cost of borrowing may rise, leading to the cancel-
        lation of potentially profitable opportunities. This concept is the subject of
        continuing empirical debate and investigation.


QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following statements is least accurate?
       A. The economic data available to policy makers have a considerable time
          lag.
       B. Economic models always offer an unambiguous guide to the future
          path of the economy.
        C. Surprise changes in exogenous economic variables make it difficult to
           use fiscal policy as a stabilization tool.
       Solution:
       B is correct. Economic forecasts from models will always have an element
       of uncertainty attached to them and thus are not unambiguous or precise in
       their prescriptions. Once a fiscal policy decision has been made and imple-
       mented, unforeseen changes in other variables may affect the economy in
       ways that would lead to changes in the fiscal policy if we had perfect fore-
       sight. Note that it is true that official economic data may be available with
       substantial time lags, making fiscal judgments more difficult.

  2. Which of the following statements is least accurate?
       A. Discretionary fiscal changes are aimed at stabilizing an economy.
       B. Automatic fiscal stabilizers include new plans for additional road
          building by the government.
        C. In the context of implementing fiscal policy, the recognition lag is
           often referred to as “driving while looking in the rearview mirror.”
       Solution:
       B is correct. New plans for road building are discretionary and not
       automatic.

  3. Which of the following statements regarding a fiscal stimulus is most
     accurate?
       A. Accommodative monetary policy reduces the impact of a fiscal
          stimulus.
       B. Different statistical models will predict different impacts for a fiscal
          stimulus.
        C. It is always possible to precisely predict the impact of a fiscal stimulus
           on employment.
       Solution:
       B is correct. Different models embrace differing views on how the economy
       works, including differing views on the impact of fiscal stimuli.

                             4. Which of the following statements is most accurate?
                                A. An increase in the budget deficit is always expansionary.
                                B. An increase in government spending is always expansionary.
                                 C. The structural deficit is always larger than the deficit below full
                                    employment.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Note that increases in government spending may be accompa-
                                nied by even bigger rises in tax receipts and hence may not be expansionary.

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1. Crowding out refers to a:
   A. fall in interest rates that reduces private investment.

   B. rise in private investment that reduces private consumption.

   C. rise in government borrowing that reduces the ability of the private sector
      to access investment funds.

2. A contractionary fiscal policy will always involve which of the following?
   A. Balanced budget

   B. Reduction in government spending

   C. Fall in the budget deficit or rise in the surplus

3. Which one of the following statements is most accurate?
   A. Ricardian equivalence refers to individuals having no idea of future tax
      liabilities.

   B. Governments do not allow political pressures to influence fiscal policies but
      do allow voters to affect monetary policies.

   C. If there is high unemployment in an economy, then easy monetary and fiscal
      policies should lead to an expansion in aggregate demand.

4. Which statement regarding fiscal policy is most accurate?
   A. Cyclically adjusted budget deficits are appropriate indicators of fiscal policy.

   B. To raise business capital spending, personal income taxes should be
      reduced.

   C. An increase in the budget surplus is associated with expansionary fiscal
      policy.

5. The least likely explanation for why fiscal policy cannot stabilize aggregate de-
   mand completely is that:
   A. private sector behavior changes over time.

   B. policy changes are implemented very quickly.

   C. fiscal policy focuses more on inflation than on unemployment.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. C is correct. A fall in interest rates is likely to lead to a rise in investment. Crowd-
                             ing out refers to government borrowing that reduces the ability of the private
                             sector to invest.

                          2. C is correct. Note that a reduction in government spending could be accompa-
                             nied by an even bigger fall in taxation, making it be expansionary.

                          3. C is correct. Note that governments often allow pressure groups to affect fiscal
                             policy and that Ricardian equivalence involves individuals correctly anticipating
                             future taxes. Thus, A and B are not correct choices.

                          4. A is correct. Cyclically adjusted budget deficits are appropriate indicators of fiscal
                             policy. These are defined as the deficit that would exist if the economy was at full
                             employment (or full potential output).

                          5. B is correct. Fiscal policy is subject to recognition, action, and impact lags.

INTRODUCTION
Central banks play several important roles in modern economies. These roles include
                                                                                          1
being the monopoly supplier of the currency, the banker to the government and the
bankers’ bank, the lender of last resort, the regulator and supervisor of the payments
system, the conductor of monetary policy, and the supervisor of the banking system.
Central banks have three primary tools available to them: open market operations, the
refinancing rate, and reserve requirements. The success of central banks is thought to
depend on three key concepts: central bank independence, credibility, and transparency.
Both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, but they do so through
differing channels with differing impacts on the composition of aggregate demand.

                                 ■   The highest profile role that central banks assume is the operation of a
                                     country’s monetary policy, which refers to central bank activities that
                                     are directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an
                                     economy.
                                 ■   The overarching goal of most central banks in maintaining price stabil-
                                     ity is the associated goal of controlling inflation.
                                 ■   Central banks can manipulate the money supply in one of three ways:
                                     open market operations, its official policy rate and associated actions
                                     in the repo market, and manipulation of official reserve requirements.
                                 ■   The central bank target interest rate (or policy rate) is used to influ-
                                     ence short- and long-term interest rates and, ultimately, real economic
                                     activity.
                                 ■   The central bank’s policy rate works through the economy via the fol-
                                     lowing interconnected channels: short-term interest rates, changes in
                                     the values of key asset prices, the exchange rate, and the expectations
                                     of economic agents.
                                 ■   The success of inflation-targeting by central banks depends on three
                                     key characteristics: central bank independence, credibility, and
                                     transparency.
                                 ■   Many emerging market economies choose to operate monetary policy
                                     by targeting their currency’s exchange rate, rather than an explicit
                                     level of domestic inflation.
                                 ■   A major problem for central banks as they try to manage the money
                                     supply to influence the real economy is that they cannot control the
                                     amount of money that households and corporations put in banks on
                                     deposit, nor can they easily control the willingness of banks to create
                                     money by expanding credit.
                                 ■   Both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, but they
                                     do so through differing channels with differing impacts on the compo-
                                     sition of aggregate demand.
                                 ■   Both fiscal and monetary policies suffer from a lack of precise cur-
                                     rent knowledge of the economy, because periodic economic data are
                                     released with a time lag and are subject to revision.
                                 ■   The interaction between monetary and fiscal policies is evident in the
                                     Ricardian equivalence because if tax cuts have no impact on private
                                     spending due to higher expected future taxes, then this may lead pol-
                                     icy makers to favor monetary tools.

Roles of Central Banks and Objectives of Monetary Policy
Central banks play several key roles in modern economies. Generally, a central bank
is the sole supplier of the domestic currency, the banker to the government and the
bankers’ bank, the lender of last resort, the regulator and supervisor of the payments
system, the conductor of monetary policy, and the supervisor of the banking system.
Let us examine these roles in turn.
    In its earliest form, money could be exchanged for a prespecified precious com-
modity, usually gold, and promissory notes were issued by many private banks. Today,
however, state-owned institutions—usually central banks—are designated in law as
being the monopoly suppliers of a currency. Initially, these monopolists supplied
money that could be converted into a prespecified amount of gold; they adhered to a
gold standard. For example, until 1931, bank notes issued by Britain’s central bank,
the Bank of England, could be redeemed at the bank for a prespecified amount of gold.
But Britain, like most other major economies, abandoned this convertibility principle
in the first half of the twentieth century. Money in all major economies today is not
convertible by law into anything else, but it is, in law, legal tender. This means that it
must be accepted when offered in exchange for goods and services. Money that is not
convertible into any other commodity is known as fiat money. Fiat money derives its
value through government decree and because people accept it for payment of goods
and services and for debt repayment.
    As long as fiat money is acceptable to everyone as a medium of exchange, and it
holds its value over time, then it also will be able to serve as a unit of account. However,
once an economy has moved to a system of fiat money, the role of the supplier of that
money becomes even more crucial because they could, for example, expand the supply
of this money indefinitely should they wish to do so. Central banks, therefore, play a
crucial role in modern economies as the suppliers and guardians of the value of their
fiat currencies and as institutions charged with the role of maintaining confidence
in their currencies. As the sole suppliers of domestic currency, central banks are at
the center of economic life. As such, they assume other roles in addition to being the
suppliers and guardians of the value of their currencies.
    Most central banks act as the banker to the government and to other banks. They
also act as a lender of last resort to banks. Because the central bank effectively has
the capacity to print money, it is in the position to be able to supply the funds to banks
that are facing crisis. The facts that economic agents know that the central bank stands
ready to provide the liquidity required by any of the banks under its jurisdiction and
that they trust government bank deposit insurance help to prevent bank runs in the
first place. However, the recent financial crisis has shown that this knowledge is not
always sufficient to deter a bank run.

EXAMPLE 1

   The Northern Rock Bank Run
   In the latter part of the summer of 2007, the fall in US house prices and the
   related implosion of the US sub-prime mortgage market became the catalyst
   for a global liquidity crisis. Banks began to hoard cash and refused to lend to
   other banks at anything other than extremely punitive interest rates through
   the interbank market. This caused severe difficulties for a UK mortgage bank,
   Northern Rock. Northern Rock’s mortgage book had expanded rapidly in the
   preceding years as it borrowed aggressively from the money markets. It is now
   clear that this expansion was at the expense of loan quality. The then–UK reg-
   ulatory authority, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), later reported in 2008
   that Northern Rock’s lending practices did not pay due regard to either the credit
   quality of the mortgagees or the values of the properties on which the mortgages

                             were secured. Being at the worst end of banking practice and relying heavily
                             on international capital markets for its funding, Northern Rock was therefore
                             susceptible to a global reduction in liquidity. As the liquidity crisis took hold,
                             Northern Rock found that it could not replace its maturing money market
                             borrowings. On 12 September 2007, in desperate need of liquidity, Northern
                             Rock’s board approached the UK central bank to ask for the necessary funds.
                                  However, the news of Northern Rock’s perilous liquidity position became
                             known by the public and, more pertinently, by Northern Rock’s retail deposi-
                             tors. On 14 September, having heard the news, queues began to form outside
                             Northern Rock branches as depositors tried to withdraw their savings. On that
                             day, it was estimated that Northern Rock depositors withdrew around GBP1
                             billion, representing 5 percent of Northern Rock’s deposits. Further panic ensued
                             as investors in “internet-only” Northern Rock accounts could not withdraw their
                             money because of the collapse of Northern Rock’s website. A further GBP1
                             billion was withdrawn over the next two days.
                                  Northern Rock’s share price dropped rapidly, as did the share prices of
                             other similar UK banks. The crisis therefore threatened to engulf more than
                             one bank. To prevent contagion, the chancellor of the exchequer announced
                             on 17 September that the UK government would guarantee all Northern Rock
                             deposits. This announcement was enough to stabilize the situation and given
                             that lending to Northern Rock was now just like lending to the government,
                             deposits actually started to rise again.
                                  Eventually Northern Rock was nationalized by the UK government, with
                             the hope that at some time in the future it could be privatized once its balance
                             sheet had been repaired.

                              Central banks often are charged by the government to supervise the banking sys-
                          tem, or at least to supervise those banks that they license to accept deposits. In some
                          countries, this role is undertaken by a separate authority. In other countries, the central
                          bank can be jointly responsible with another body for the supervision of its banks.
                              Exhibit 1 lists the banking supervisors in the G–10 countries; central banks are
                          underlined. As the exhibit shows, most but not all bank systems have a single super-
                          visor, which is not necessarily a central bank. A few countries, such as Germany and
                          the United States, have more than one supervisor.

Role of Central Banks                                                                         109


The United Kingdom is an interesting case study in this regard. Until May 1997, the
Bank of England had statutory responsibility for banking supervision in the United
Kingdom. In May 1997, banking supervision was removed from the Bank of England
and assigned to a new agency, the Financial Services Authority (FSA). However, the
removal of responsibility for banking supervision from the central bank was seen by
some as being a contributory factor in the run on the mortgage bank Northern Rock,
and generally as a contributory factor in the recent banking crisis. Because of this
perceived weakness in the separation of the central bank from banking supervision,
the Bank of England regained responsibility for banking supervision and regulation
in 2013.
    Perhaps the least appreciated role of a central bank is its role in the payments
system. Central banks are usually asked to oversee, regulate, and set standards for
a country’s payments system. For the system to work properly, procedures must be
robust and standardized. The central bank will usually oversee the payments system
and will also be responsible for the successful introduction of any new processes.
Given the international nature of finance, the central bank will also be responsible for
coordinating payments systems internationally with other central banks.
    Most central banks are responsible for managing their country’s foreign currency
reserves as well as its gold reserves. With regard to the latter, even though countries
abandoned the gold standard in the early part of the twentieth century, the world’s
central bankers still hold large quantities of gold. As such, if central banks were to
decide to sell significant proportions of their gold reserves, it could potentially depress
gold prices.
    Finally, central banks are usually responsible for the operation of a country’s
monetary policy. This is arguably the highest profile role that these important orga-
nizations assume. Recall that monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are
directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy. As the
sole supplier of a country’s domestic currency, central banks are in the ideal position
to implement and determine monetary policy.
    To summarize, central banks assume a range of roles and responsibilities. They do
not all assume responsibility for the supervision of the banks, but all of the following
roles normally are assumed by the central bank:
    ■   Monopoly supplier of the currency;
    ■   Banker to the government and the bankers’ bank;
    ■   Lender of last resort;
    ■   Regulator and supervisor of the payments system;
    ■   Conductor of monetary policy; and
    ■   Supervisor of the banking system.



The Objectives of Monetary Policy
Central banks fulfill a variety of important roles, but for what overarching purpose?
A perusal of the websites of the world’s central banks will reveal a wide range of
explanations of their objectives. Their objectives are clearly related to their roles,
and so there is frequent mention of objectives related to the stability of the financial
system and to the payments systems. Some central banks are charged with doing all
they can to maintain full employment and output. Some also have related but less
tangible roles, such as maintaining confidence in the financial system, or even to pro-
mote understanding of the financial sector. Most seem to acknowledge explicitly one
overarching objective—the objective of maintaining price stability.

                             So, although central banks usually have to perform many roles, most specify an
                          overarching objective. Exhibit 2 lists what we might call the primary objectives of a
                          number of central banks, from both developed market and emerging market economies.

                             Its institutional mission is to “ensure the stability of the currency’s purchasing

                                  in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127 (1).”

                                 A. lender of last resort.
                                 B. banker to the government and banks.

      C. body that sets tax rates on interest on savings.
     Solution:
     C is correct. A central bank is normally the lender of last resort and the
     banker to the banks and government, but the determination of all tax rates
     is normally the preserve of the government and is a fiscal policy issue.

  2. Which of the following best describes the overarching, long-run objective of
     most central banks?
      A. Price stability
      B. Fast economic growth
      C. Current account surplus
     Solution:
     A is correct. Central banks normally have a variety of objectives, but the
     overriding one is nearly always price stability.

  3. Which role is a central bank least likely to assume?
      A. Lender of last resort
      B. Supplier of the currency
      C. Sole supervisor of banks
     Solution:
     C is correct. The supervision of banks is not a role that all central banks
     assume. When it is a central bank’s role, responsibility may be shared with
     one or more entities.

    As we have discussed, one of the essential features of a monetary system is that
the medium of exchange should have a relatively stable value from one period to the
next. Arguably then, the overarching goal of most central banks in maintaining price
stability is the associated goal of controlling inflation. Before we explore the tools
central banks use to control inflation, we should first consider the potential costs of
inflation. In other words, we should ask why it is that central bankers believe that it
is so important to control a nominal variable.

                          Open Market Operations
                          One of the most direct ways for a central bank to increase or reduce the amount of
                          money in circulation is through open market operations. Open market operations
                          involve the purchase and sale of government bonds from and to commercial banks
                          or designated market makers. For example, when the central bank buys government
                          bonds from commercial banks, this increases the reserves of private sector banks
                          on the asset side of their balance sheets. If banks then use these surplus reserves by
                          increasing lending to corporations and households, then broad money growth expands
                          through the money multiplier process. Similarly, the central bank can sell government
                          bonds to commercial banks. In so doing, the reserves of commercial banks decline,
                          reducing their capacity to make loans (i.e., create credit) to households and corpora-
                          tions and thus causing broad money growth to decline through the money multiplier
                          mechanism. In using open market operations, the central bank may target a desired
                          level of commercial bank reserves or a desired interest rate for these reserves.


                          The Central Bank’s Policy Rate
                          The most obvious expression of a central bank’s intentions and views comes through
                          the interest rate it sets. The name of the official interest rate (or official policy rate
                          or just policy rate) varies from central bank to central bank, but its purpose is to
                          influence short- and long-term interest rates and ultimately real economic activity.
                               The interest rate that a central bank sets and that it announces publicly is nor-
                          mally the rate at which it is willing to lend money to the commercial banks (although
                          practices do vary from country to country). This policy rate can be achieved by using
                          short-term collateralized lending rates, known as repo rates. For example, if the central
                          bank wishes to increase the supply of money, it might buy bonds (usually government
                          bonds) from the banks, with an agreement to sell them back at some time in the future.
                          This transaction is known as a repurchase agreement. Normally, the maturity of repo
                          agreements ranges from overnight to two weeks. In effect, this represents a secured
                          loan to the banks, and the lender (in this case the central bank) earns the repo rate.
                               Suppose that a central bank announces an increase in its official interest rate.
                          Commercial banks normally would increase their base rates at the same time. A
                          commercial bank’s base rate is the reference rate on which it bases lending rates to
                          all other customers. For example, large corporate clients might pay the base rate plus
                          1 percent on their borrowing from a bank, whereas the same bank might lend money
                          to a small corporate client at the base rate plus 3 percent. But why would commercial
                          banks immediately increase their base or reference rates just because the central bank’s
                          refinancing rate had increased?
                               The answer is that commercial banks do not want to lend at a rate of interest below
                          that which they are charged by the central bank. Effectively, the central bank can force
                          commercial banks to borrow from it at this rate because it can conduct open market
                          operations that create a shortage of money, forcing the banks to sell bonds to it with
                          an agreed-upon repurchase price (i.e., a repurchase agreement). The repo rate would
                          be such that the central bank earned the official refinancing rate on the transactions.
                               The name of each central bank’s official refinancing rate varies. The Bank of
                          England’s refinancing rate is the two-week repo rate. In other words, the Bank of
                          England fixes the rate at which it is willing to lend two-week money to the banking
                          sector. The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) official policy rate is known as the refi-
                          nancing rate, which defines the rate at which the ECB is willing to lend short-term
                          money to the Euro area banking sector.
                               The corresponding rate in the United States is the discount rate, which is the rate for
                          member banks borrowing directly from the Federal Reserve System. The most import-
                          ant interest rate used in US monetary policy is the federal funds rate. The federal

funds rate (or fed funds rate) is the interbank lending rate on overnight borrowings
of reserves. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) seeks to move this rate to
a target level by reducing or adding reserves to the banking system by means of open
market operations. The level of the rate is reviewed by the FOMC at its meetings held
every six weeks (although the target can be changed between meetings, if necessary).
    Through the setting of a policy rate, a central bank can manipulate the amount
of money in the money markets. Generally speaking, the higher the policy rate, the
higher the potential penalty that banks will have to pay to the central bank if they
run short of liquidity, the greater their willingness will be to reduce lending, and the
more likely it will be that broad money growth will shrink.


Reserve Requirements
The third primary way in which central banks can limit or increase the supply of
money in an economy is through the reserve requirement. We already have seen
that the money creation process is more powerful the lower the percentage reserve
requirement of banks. So, a central bank could restrict money creation by raising
the reserve requirements of banks. However, this policy tool is not used much today
in developed market economies. Indeed, some central banks, such as the Bank of
England, no longer even set minimum reserve requirements for the banks under their
jurisdiction. Changing reserve requirements frequently is disruptive for banks. For
example, if a central bank increased the reserve requirements, a bank that was short
on reserves might have to cease its lending activities until it had built up the necessary
reserves, because deposits would be unlikely to rise quickly enough for the bank to
build its reserves in this way. However, reserve requirements are still actively used
in many emerging market countries to control lending and remain a potential policy
tool for those central banks that do not currently use it.
    To summarize, central banks can manipulate the money supply in one of three ways:
    ■   open market operations;
    ■   official policy rates and associated actions in the repo market; and
    ■   manipulation of official reserve requirements.



The Transmission Mechanism
The overarching goal of a central bank is to maintain price stability. We have demon-
strated how a central bank can manipulate the money supply and growth of the money
supply. We also indicated how policy rates set and targeted by the central banks are
usually very short term in nature; often they target overnight interest rates. However,
most businesses and individuals in the real economy borrow and lend over much
longer time frames than this. It may not be obvious, then, how changing short-term
interest rates can influence the real economy, particularly if money neutrality holds in
the long run. The fact that central bankers believe that they can affect real economic
variables, in particular economic growth, by influencing broad money growth suggests
that they believe that money is not neutral—at least not in the short run.
    Exhibit 3 presents a stylized representation of the monetary transmission mecha-
nism. This is the process whereby a central bank’s interest rate is transmitted through
the economy and ultimately affects the rate of increase of prices—that is, inflation.

                          Suppose that a central bank announces an increase in its official interest rate. The
                          implementation of the policy may begin to work through the economy via four interre-
                          lated channels. Those channels include bank lending rates, asset prices, agents’ expec-
                          tations, and exchange rates. First, as described earlier, the base rates of commercial
                          banks and interbank rates should rise in response to the increase in the official rate.
                          Banks, in turn, would increase the cost of borrowing for individuals and companies
                          over both short- and long-term horizons. Businesses and consumers would then tend
                          to borrow less as interest rates rise. An increase in short-term interest rates could
                          also cause the price of such assets as bonds or the value of capital projects to fall as
                          the discount rate for future cash flows rises.
                              Market participants would then come to the view that higher interest rates will
                          lead to slower economic growth, reduced profits, and reduced borrowing to finance
                          asset purchases. Exporters’ profits might decline if the rise in interest rates causes the
                          country’s exchange rate to appreciate, because this would make domestic exports more
                          expensive to overseas buyers and dampen demand to purchase them. The fall in asset
                          prices as well as an increase in prices would reduce household financial wealth and
                          therefore lead to a reduction in consumption growth. Expectations regarding interest
                          rates can play a significant role in the economy. Often companies and individuals will
                          make investment and purchasing decisions based on their interest rate expectations,
                          extrapolated from recent events. If the central bank’s interest rate move is widely
                          expected to be followed by other interest rate increases, investors and companies will
                          act accordingly. Consumption, borrowing, and asset prices may all decline as a result
                          of the revision in expectations.
                              A rise in the central bank’s policy rate can reduce real domestic demand and net
                          external demand (that is, the difference between export and import consumption)
                          through a wide range of interconnected ways. Weaker total demand would tend to put
                          downward pressure on the rate of domestic inflation—as would a stronger currency,
                          which would reduce the prices of imports. Taken together, these factors might begin
                          to put downward pressure on the overall measure of inflation.
                              To summarize, the central bank’s policy rate works through the economy via one
                          or more of the following interconnected channels:
                              ■    Short-term interest rates;
                              ■    Changes in the values of key asset prices;
                              ■    The exchange rate; and
                              ■    The expectations of economic agents.

QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following variables are most likely to be affected by a
     change in a central bank’s policy rate?
      A. Asset prices only
      B. Expectations about future interest rates only
      C. Both asset prices and expectations about future interest rates
     Solution:
     C is correct. The price of equities, for example, might be affected by the
     expectation of future policy interest rate changes. In other words, a rate
     change may be taken as a signal of the future stance of monetary policy—
     contractionary or expansionary.

  2. Which of the following does a central bank seek to influence directly via the
     setting of its official interest rate?
      A. Import prices
      B. Domestic inflation
      C. Inflation expectations
     Solution:
     C is correct. By setting its official interest rate, a central bank could expect
     to have a direct influence on inflation expectations—as well as on other
     market interest rates, asset prices, and the exchange rate (where this is
     freely floating). If it can influence these factors, it might ultimately hope to
     influence import prices (via changes in the exchange rate) and also domes-
     tically generated inflation (via its impact on domestic or external demand).
     The problem is that the workings of the transmission mechanism—from the
     official interest rate to inflation—are complex and can change over time.

  3. Monetary policy is least likely to include:
      A. setting an inflation rate target.
      B. changing an official interest rate.
      C. enacting a transfer payment program.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Transfer payment programs represent fiscal, not monetary
     policy.

  4. Which is the most accurate statement regarding central banks and monetary
     policy?
      A. Central bank activities are typically intended to maintain price
         stability.
      B. Monetary policies work through the economy via four independent
         channels.

                                  C. Commercial and interbank interest rates move inversely to official
                                     interest rates.
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. Central bank activities are typically intended to maintain price
                                 stability. B is not correct because the transmission channels of monetary
                                 policy are not independent.

                          Inflation Targeting
                          Throughout the 1990s, a consensus began to build among both central bankers and
                          politicians that the best way to control inflation and thereby maintain price stability
                          was to target a certain level of inflation and to ensure that this target was met by
                          monitoring a wide range of monetary, financial, and real economic variables. Today,
                          inflation-targeting frameworks are the cornerstone of monetary policy and macro-
                          economic policy in many economies. Exhibit 4 shows the growth in the number of
                          inflation-targeting monetary policy regimes over time.
                              The inflation-targeting framework that is now commonly practiced was pioneered
                          in New Zealand. In 1988, the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas,
                          announced that economic policy would focus on bringing inflation down from the
                          prevailing level of around 6 percent to a target range of 0 to 2 percent. This goal was
                          given legal status by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989. As part of the Act,
                          the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) was given the role of pursuing this target.
                          The bank was given operational independence; it was free to set interest rates in
                          the way that it thought would best meet the inflation target. Although the RBNZ had
                          independent control of monetary policy, it was still accountable to the government
                          and was charged with communicating its decisions in a clear and transparent way.
                          As Exhibit 4 shows, the New Zealand model was widely copied.

Although these inflation-targeting regimes vary a little from economy to economy,
their success is thought to depend on three key concepts: central bank independence,
credibility, and transparency.


Central Bank Independence
In most cases, the central bank that is charged with targeting inflation has a degree
of independence from its government. This independence is thought to be important.
It is conceivable that politicians could announce an inflation target and direct the
central bank to set interest rates accordingly. Indeed, this was the process adopted
in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1997. But politicians have a constant eye
on reelection and might be tempted, for example, to keep rates “too low” in the
lead-up to an election in the hope that this might help their reelection prospects.
As a consequence, this might lead to higher inflation. Thus, it is now widely believed
that monetary policy decisions should rest in the hands of an organization that is
remote from the electoral process. The central bank is the natural candidate to be the
monopoly supplier of a currency.
     However, there are degrees of independence. For example, the head of the central
bank is nearly always chosen by government officials. The chair of the US Federal
Reserve’s Board of Governors is appointed by the president of the United States of
America; the head of the ECB is chosen by the committee of Euro area finance min-
isters; and the governor of the Bank of England is chosen by the chancellor of the
exchequer. So, in practice, separating control from political influence completely is
probably an impossible (although a desirable) goal.
     There are further degrees of independence. Some central banks are both opera-
tionally and target independent. This means that they not only decide the level of
interest rates but also determine the definition of inflation that they target, the rate
of inflation that they target, and the horizon over which the target is to be achieved.
The ECB has independence of this kind. By contrast, other central banks—including
those in New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—are tasked to hit a definition
and level of inflation determined by the government. Therefore, these central banks
are only operationally independent.


Credibility
The independence of the central bank and public confidence in it are key in the design
of an inflation-targeting regime.
    To illustrate the role of credibility, suppose that instead of the central bank, the
government assumes the role of targeting inflation, but the government is heavily
indebted. Given that higher inflation reduces the real value of debt, the government
would have an incentive to avoid reaching the inflation target or to set a high inflation
target such that price stability and confidence in the currency could be endangered. As
a result, few would believe the government was really intent on controlling inflation;
thus, the government would lack credibility. Many governments have very large levels
of debt, especially since the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis. In such a situation,

                          economic agents might expect a high level of inflation, regardless of the actual, stated
                          target. The target might have little credibility if the organization’s likelihood of sticking
                          to it is in doubt.
                              If a respected central bank assumes the inflation-targeting role and if economic
                          agents believe that the central bank will hit its target, this belief could become
                          self-fulfilling. If everyone believes that the central bank will hit an inflation target of 2
                          percent next year, this expectation might be built into wage claims and other nominal
                          contracts that would make it hit the 2 percent target. For this reason, central bankers
                          pay a great deal of attention to inflation expectations. If these expectations were to
                          rise rapidly, perhaps following a rapid increase in oil prices, unchecked expectations
                          could get embedded into wage claims and eventually cause inflation to rise.


                          Transparency
                          One way to establish credibility is for a central bank to be transparent in its decision
                          making. Many, if not all, independent inflation-targeting central banks produce a
                          quarterly assessment of their economies. These inflation reports, as they are usually
                          known, give central banks’ views on the range of indicators that they watch when they
                          come to their (usually) monthly interest rate decision. They will consider and outline
                          their views on the following subjects, usually in this order:
                              ■    Broad money aggregates and credit conditions;
                              ■    Conditions in financial markets;
                              ■    Developments in the real economy (e.g., the labor market); and
                              ■    Evolution of prices.
                              Consideration of all of these important components of an economy is then usually
                          followed by a forecast of growth and inflation over a medium-term horizon, usually
                          two years.
                              By explaining their views on the economy and by being transparent in decision
                          making, the independent, inflation-targeting central banks seek to gain reputation and
                          credibility, making it easier to influence inflation expectations and hence ultimately
                          easier to meet the inflation target.

                          The Target
                          Whether the target is set by the central bank or by the government for the central
                          bank to hit, the level of the target and the horizon over which the target is to be hit
                          is a crucial consideration in all inflation-targeting frameworks.

Exhibit 5 shows that many central banks in developed economies target an inflation
rate of 2 percent based on a consumer price index (CPI). Given that the operation
of monetary policy is both art and science, the banks are normally allowed a range
around the central target of +1 percent or –1 percent. For example, with a 2 percent
target, they would be tasked to keep inflation between 1 percent and 3 percent. But
why target 2 percent and not 0 percent?
    The answer is that aiming to hit 0 percent could result in negative inflation, known
as deflation. One of the limitations of monetary policy that we will discuss is its ability
or inability to deal with periods of deflation. If deflation is something to be avoided,
why not target 10 percent? The answer to this question is that levels of inflation that
high would not be consistent with price stability; such a high inflation rate would
further tend to be associated with high inflation volatility and uncertainty. Central
bankers seem to agree that 2 percent is far enough away from the risks of deflation
and low enough not to lead to destabilizing inflation shocks.
    Finally, we should keep in mind that the headline inflation rate that is announced
in most economies every month, and which is the central bank’s target, is a mea-
sure of how much a basket of goods and services has risen over the previous twelve
months. It is history. Furthermore, interest rate changes made today will take some
time to have their full effect on the real economy as they make their way through the
monetary transmission mechanism. It is for these two reasons that inflation targeters
do not target current inflation but instead usually focus on inflation two years ahead.
    Although inflation-targeting mandates may vary from country to country, they have
common elements: the specification of an explicit inflation target, with permissible
bounds, and a requirement that the central bank should be transparent in its objectives
and policy actions. This is all usually laid out in legislation that imposes statutory
obligations on the central bank. As mentioned earlier, New Zealand pioneered the
inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy that has since been copied widely. New
Zealand’s Policy Targets Agreement, which specifies the inflation-targeting mandate
of its central bank, the RBNZ, is included in Example 2.

         Reserve Bank of New Zealand (the Bank) is made under section 9 of the
         Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 (the Act). The Minister and the
         Governor agree as follows:

   Price stability

        a. Under Section 8 of the Act the Reserve Bank is required to conduct
           monetary policy with the goal of maintaining a stable general level of
           prices.

                                  b. The Government’s economic objective is to promote a growing, open
                                     and competitive economy as the best means of delivering permanently
                                     higher incomes and living standards for New Zealanders. Price stabil-
                                     ity plays an important part in supporting this objective.
                             Policy target

                                  a. In pursuing the objective of a stable general level of prices, the Bank
                                     shall monitor prices as measured by a range of price indexes. The price
                                     stability target will be defined in terms of the All Groups Consumers
                                     Price Index (CPI), as published by Statistics New Zealand.
                                  b. For the purpose of this agreement, the policy target shall be to keep
                                     future CPI inflation outcomes between 1 per cent and 3 per cent on
                                     average over the medium term.
                             Inflation variations around target

                                  a. For a variety of reasons, the actual annual rate of CPI inflation will
                                     vary around the medium-term trend of inflation, which is the focus
                                     of the policy target. Amongst these reasons, there is a range of events
                                     whose impact would normally be temporary. Such events include, for
                                     example, shifts in the aggregate price level as a result of exceptional
                                     movements in the prices of commodities traded in world markets,
                                     changes in indirect taxes,9 significant government policy changes that
                                     directly affect prices, or a natural disaster affecting a major part of the
                                     economy.
                                  b. When disturbances of the kind described in clause 3(a) arise, the Bank
                                     will respond consistent with meeting its medium-term target.
                             Communication, implementation, and accountability

                                  a. On occasions when the annual rate of inflation is outside the medi-
                                     um-term target range, or when such occasions are projected, the Bank
                                     shall explain in Policy Statements made under section 15 of the Act
                                     why such outcomes have occurred, or are projected to occur, and what
                                     measures it has taken, or proposes to take, to ensure that inflation
                                     outcomes remain consistent with the medium-term target.
                                  b. In pursuing its price stability objective, the Bank shall implement
                                     monetary policy in a sustainable, consistent, and transparent manner
                                     and shall seek to avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates
                                     and the exchange rate.
                                  c. The Bank shall be fully accountable for its judgments and actions in
                                     implementing monetary policy.”

                              To summarize, an inflation-targeting framework normally has the following features:
                              ■   An independent and credible central bank;
                              ■   A commitment to transparency;
                              ■   A decision-making framework that considers a wide range of economic and
                                  financial market indicators; and
                              ■   A clear, symmetric, and forward-looking medium-term inflation target,
                                  sufficiently above 0 percent to avoid the risk of deflation but low enough to
                                  ensure a significant degree of price stability.

   Indeed, independence, credibility, and transparency are arguably the crucial ingre-
dients for an effective central bank, whether or not they target inflation.

The Main Exceptions to the Inflation-Targeting Rule
Although the practice of inflation targeting is widespread, two prominent central
banks have not adopted a formal inflation target along the lines of the New Zealand
model: the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the US Federal Reserve System.


The Bank of Japan
Japan’s central bank, the BoJ, does not target an explicit measure of inflation. Japan’s
government and its monetary authorities have been trying to combat deflation for
much of the past two decades. However, despite their efforts—including the outright
printing of money—inflation has remained very weak. Inflation targeting is seen very
much as a way of combating and controlling inflation; as such, it would seem to have
no place in an economy that suffers from persistent deflation.
    Some economists have argued, however, that an inflation target is exactly what
the Japanese economy needs. By announcing that positive inflation of say 3 percent
is desired by the central bank, this might become a self-fulfilling prophecy if Japanese
consumers and companies factor this target into nominal wage and price contracts.
But for economic agents to believe that the target will be achieved, they have to believe
that the central bank is capable of achieving it. Given that the BoJ has failed to engineer
persistent, positive inflation, it is debatable how much credibility Japanese households
and corporations would afford such an inflation-targeting policy.


The US Federal Reserve System
It is perhaps rather ironic that the world’s most influential central bank, the US Federal
Reserve, which controls the supply of the world’s de facto reserve currency, the US dol-
lar, does not have an explicit inflation target. However, it is felt that the single-minded
pursuit of inflation might not be compatible with the Fed’s statutory goal as laid out
in the Federal Reserve Act, which charges the Fed’s board to: “promote effectively the
goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”
     In other words, it has been argued that inflation targeting might compromise the
goal of “maximum employment.” In practice, however, the Fed has indicated that it
sees core inflation measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator
of about, or just below, 2 percent as being compatible with “stable prices.” Financial
markets therefore watch this US inflation gauge very carefully to anticipate the rate
actions of the Fed.

Monetary Policy in Developing Countries
Developing economies often face significant impediments to the successful operation
of any monetary policy—that is, the achievement of price stability. These include:
    ■   the absence of a sufficiently liquid government bond market and developed
        interbank market through which monetary policy can be conducted;
    ■   a rapidly changing economy, making it difficult to understand what the neu-
        tral rate might be and what the equilibrium relationship between monetary
        aggregates and the real economy might be;
    ■   rapid financial innovation that frequently changes the definition of the
        money supply;
    ■   a poor track record in controlling inflation in the past, making monetary
        policy intentions less credible; and

                              ■    an unwillingness of governments to grant genuine independence to the
                                   central bank.
                              Taken together, any or all of these impediments might call into question the
                          effectiveness of any developing economy’s monetary policy framework, making any
                          related monetary policy goals difficult to achieve.

                                  B. It is very difficult to eliminate all inflation from a modern economy.
                                   C. Targeting zero percent inflation runs a higher risk of a deflationary
                                      outcome.
                                  Solution:
                                  C is correct. Inflation targeting is art, not science. Sometimes inflation will
                                  be above target and sometimes below. Were central banks to target zero per-
                                  cent, then inflation would almost certainly be negative on some occasions. If
                                  a deflationary mindset then sets in among economic agents, it might be dif-
                                  ficult for the central bank to respond to this because they cannot cut interest
                                  rates much below zero.

                             2. The degree of credibility that a central bank is afforded by economic agents
                                is important because:
                                  A. they are the lender of last resort.
                                  B. they set targets that can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
                                   C. they are the monopolistic suppliers of the currency.
                                  Solution:
                                  B is correct. If a central bank operates within an inflation-targeting regime
                                  and if economic agents believe that it will achieve its target, this expectation
                                  will become embedded into wage negotiations, for example, and become
                                  a self-fulfilling prophecy. Also, banks need to be confident that the central
                                  bank will lend them money when all other sources are closed to them; oth-
                                  erwise, they might curtail their lending drastically, leading to a commensu-
                                  rate reduction in money and economic activity.

                             3. A central bank that decides the desired levels of interest rates and inflation
                                and the horizon over which the inflation objective is to be achieved is most
                                accurately described as being:
                                  A. target independent and operationally independent.
                                  B. target independent but not operationally independent.
                                   C. operationally independent but not target independent.
                                  Solution:
                                  A is correct. The central bank described is target independent because it set
                                  its own targets (e.g., the target inflation rate) and operationally independent
                                  because it decides how to achieve its targets (e.g., the time horizon).

Exchange Rate Targeting
Many developing economies choose to operate monetary policy by targeting their
currency’s exchange rate, rather than an explicit level of domestic inflation. Such
targeting involves setting a fixed level or band of values for the exchange rate against
a major currency, with the central bank supporting the target by buying and selling
the national currency in foreign exchange markets. There are recent examples of
developed economies using such an approach. In the 1980s, following the failure of
its policy of trying to control UK inflation by setting medium-term goals for money
supply growth, the UK government decided to operate monetary policy such that the
sterling’s exchange rate equaled a predetermined value in terms of German deutsche-
marks. The basic idea is that by tying a domestic economy’s currency to that of an
economy with a credible policy of maintaining low inflation, the domestic economy
would effectively “import” the inflation experience of the low-inflation economy.
    Suppose that a developing country wished to maintain the value of its currency
against the US dollar. The government or central bank would announce the currency
exchange rate that they wished to target. To simplify matters, let us assume that the
domestic inflation rates are very similar in both countries and that the monetary
authorities of the developing economy have set an exchange rate target that is consis-
tent with relative price levels in the two economies. Under these (admittedly unlikely)
circumstances, in the absence of shocks, there would be no reason for the exchange
rate to deviate significantly from this target level. As long as domestic inflation closely
mirrors US inflation, the exchange rate should remain close to its target (or within
a target band). It is in this sense that a successful exchange rate policy imports the
inflation of the foreign economy.
    Now suppose that economic activity in the developing economy starts to rise
rapidly and that domestic inflation in the developing economy rises above the level
in the United States. With a freely floating exchange rate regime, the currency of the
developing economy would start to fall against the dollar. To arrest this fall, and to
protect the exchange rate target, the developing economy’s monetary authority sells
foreign currency reserves and buys its own currency. This has the effect of reducing
the domestic money supply and increasing short-term interest rates. The developing
economy experiences a monetary policy tightening that, if expected to bring down
inflation, will cause its exchange rate to rise against the dollar.
    By contrast, in a scenario in which inflation in the developing country fell relative
to the United States, the central bank would need to sell the domestic currency to
support the target, tending to increase the domestic money supply and reduce the
rate of interest.
    In practice, the interventions of the developing economy central bank will simply
stabilize the value of its currency, with many frequent adjustments. But this simplis-
tic example should demonstrate one very important fact: When the central bank or
monetary authority chooses to target an exchange rate, interest rates and conditions
in the domestic economy must adapt to accommodate this target and domestic interest
rates and money supply can become more volatile.
    The monetary authority’s commitment to and ability to support the exchange rate
target must be credible for exchange rate targeting to be successful. If that is not the
case, then speculators may trade against the monetary authority. Speculative attacks
forced sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. The fixed
exchange rate regime was abandoned, and the United Kingdom allowed its currency to
float freely. Eventually, the UK government adopted a formal inflation target in 1997.
Similarly, in the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998, Thailand’s central bank tried to
defend the Thai baht against speculative attacks for much of the first half of 1997 but

                          then revealed at the beginning of July that it had no reserves left. The subsequent
                          devaluation triggered a debt crisis for banks and companies that had borrowed in
                          foreign currency, and contagion spread throughout Asia.
                              Despite these risks, many currencies are pegged to other currencies, most notably
                          the US dollar. Exhibit 6 shows a list of some of the currencies that were pegged to
                          (fixed against) the US dollar at the end of 2018. Other currencies operate under a
                          “managed exchange rate policy,” where they are allowed to fluctuate within a range
                          that is maintained by a monetary authority through market intervention. Dollarization
                          occurs when a country adopts the US dollar as their functional currency. This is stron-
                          ger than pegging to the dollar because under dollarization, the US dollar replaces the
                          previous national currency. Exhibit 6 breaks out countries that peg their currency to
                          the dollar and those that have adopted the US dollar as their currency.

                           QUESTION SET


                             1. When the central bank chooses to target a specific value for its
                                exchange rate:
                                A. it must also target domestic inflation.
                                B. it must also set targets for broad money growth.
                                 C. conditions in the domestic economy must adapt to accommodate this
                                    target.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. The adoption of an exchange rate target requires that the
                                central bank set interest rates to achieve this target. If the target comes
                                under pressure, domestic interest rates may have to rise, regardless of
                                domestic conditions. It may have a “target” level of inflation in mind as well
                                as “targets” for broad money growth, but as long as it targets the exchange
                                rate, domestic inflation and broad money trends must simply be allowed to
                                evolve.

                             2. With regard to monetary policy, what is the expected benefit of adopting an
                                exchange rate target?
                                A. Freedom to pursue redistributive fiscal policy
                                B. Freedom to set interest rates according to domestic conditions

       C. Ability to “import” the inflation experience of the economy whose
          currency is being targeted
      Solution:
      C is correct. Note that interest rates have to be set to achieve this target and
      are therefore subordinate to the exchange rate target and partially depen-
      dent on economic conditions in the foreign economy.

   3. Which of the following is least likely to be an impediment to the successful
      implementation of monetary policy in developing economies?
       A. Fiscal deficits
       B. Rapid financial innovation
       C. Absence of a liquid government bond market
      Solution:
      A is correct. Note that the absence of a liquid government bond market
      through which a central bank can enact open market operations and/or repo
      transactions will inhibit the implementation of monetary policy—as would
      rapid financial innovation because such innovation can change the rela-
      tionship between money and economic activity. In contrast, fiscal deficits
      are not normally an impediment to the implementation of monetary policy,
      although they could be if they were perceived to be unsustainable.

   4. A country that maintains a target exchange rate is most likely to have which
      outcome when its inflation rate rises above the level of the inflation rate in
      the target country?
       A. Increase in short-term interest rates
       B. Increase in the domestic money supply
       C. Increase in its foreign currency reserves
      Solution:
      A is correct. Interest rates are expected to rise to protect the exchange rate
      target.



Contractionary and Expansionary Monetary Policies and Their
Limitations
Most central banks will adjust liquidity conditions by adjusting their official policy rate.
When they believe that economic activity is likely to lead to an increase in inflation,
they might increase interest rates, thereby reducing liquidity. In these cases, market
analysts describe such actions as contractionary because the policy is designed to
cause the rate of growth of the money supply and the real economy to contract (see
Exhibit 3 for the possible transmission mechanism). Conversely, when the economy is
slowing and inflation and monetary trends are weakening, central banks may increase
liquidity by cutting their target rate. In these circumstances, monetary policy is said
to be expansionary.
    Thus, when policy rates are high, monetary policy may be described as contrac-
tionary; when low, it may be described as expansionary. But what are they “high” and
“low” in comparison to?
    The neutral rate of interest is often taken as the point of comparison. One way
of characterizing the neutral rate is to say that it is that rate of interest that neither
spurs on nor slows down the underlying economy. As such, when policy rates are

126   Learning Module 4                                                                             Monetary Policy


                          above the neutral rate, monetary policy is contractionary; when they are below the
                          neutral rate, monetary policy is expansionary. The neutral rate should correspond to
                          the average policy rate over a business cycle.
                              However, economists’ views of the neutral rate for any given economy might differ,
                          and therefore, their view of whether monetary policy is contractionary, neutral, or
                          expansionary might differ too. What economists do agree on is that the neutral policy
                          rate for any economy has two components:
                              ■   Real trend rate of growth of the underlying economy, and
                              ■   Long-run expected inflation.
                              The real trend rate of growth of an economy is also difficult to discern, but it
                          corresponds to that rate of economic growth that is achievable in the long run that
                          gives rise to stable inflation. If we are thinking about an economy with a credible
                          inflation-targeting regime, where the inflation target is, say, 2 percent per year and
                          where an analyst believes that the economy can grow sustainably over the long term
                          at a rate of 2.5 percent per year, then they might also estimate the neutral rate to be:
                              Neutral rate = Trend growth + Inflation target = 2.5% + 2.0% = 4.5%
                          The analyst would therefore describe the central bank’s monetary policy as being
                          contractionary when its policy rate is above 4.5 percent and expansionary when it is
                          below this level.
                              In practice, central banks often indicate what they believe to be the neutral rate
                          of interest for their economy too. But determining this “neutral rate” is more art than
                          science. For example, many analysts have recently revised down their estimates of
                          trend growth for many western countries following the collapse of the credit bubble,
                          because in many cases, the governments and private individuals of these economies
                          are now being forced to reduce consumption levels and pay down their debts.


                          What’s the Source of the Shock to the Inflation Rate?
                          An important aspect of monetary policy for those charged with its conduct is the
                          determination of the source of any shock to the inflation rate. Suppose that the mon-
                          etary authority sees that inflation is rising beyond its target, or simply in a way that
                          threatens price stability. If this rise was caused by an increase in the confidence of
                          consumers and business leaders, which in turn has led to increases in consumption and
                          investment growth rates, then we could think of it as being a demand shock. In this
                          instance, it might be appropriate to tighten monetary policy to bring the inflationary
                          pressures generated by these domestic demand pressures under control.
                              However, suppose instead that the rise in inflation was caused by a rise in the price
                          of oil (for the sake of argument). In this case, the economy is facing a supply shock,
                          and raising interest rates might make a bad situation worse. Consumers are already
                          facing an increase in the cost of fuel prices that might cause profits and consumption
                          to fall and eventually unemployment to rise. Putting up interest rates in this instance
                          might simply exacerbate the oil price-induced downturn, which ultimately might
                          cause inflation to fall sharply.
                              It is important, then, for the monetary authority to try to identify the source of the
                          shock before engineering a contractionary or expansionary monetary policy phase.


                          Limitations of Monetary Policy
                          The limitations of monetary policy include problems in the transmission mechanism
                          and the relative ineffectiveness of interest rate adjustment as a policy tool in defla-
                          tionary environments.

Problems in the Monetary Transmission Mechanism
In Exhibit 3, we presented a stylized representation of the monetary policy transmission
mechanism, including the channels of bank lending rates, asset prices, expectations,
and exchange rates. The implication of the diagram is that there are channels through
which the actions of the central bank or monetary authority are transmitted to both
the nominal and real economy. In some occasions, however, the will of the monetary
authority is not transmitted seamlessly through the economy.
     Suppose that a central bank raises interest rates because it is concerned about the
strength of underlying inflationary pressures. Long-term interest rates are influenced
by the path of expected short-term interest rates, so the outcome of the rate hike
will depend on market expectations. Suppose that bond market participants think
that short-term rates are already too high, that the monetary authorities are risking
a recession, and that the central bank will likely undershoot its inflation target. This
fall in inflation expectations could cause long-term interest rates to fall. That would
make long-term borrowing cheaper for companies and households, which could in
turn stimulate economic activity rather than cause it to contract.
     Arguably, the more credible the monetary authority, the more stable the long end
of the yield curve; moreover, the monetary authority will be more confident that its
“policy message” will be transmitted throughout the economy. A term recently used
in the marketplace is bond market vigilantes. These “vigilantes” are bond market
participants who might reduce their demand for long-term bonds, thus pushing up
their yields, if they believe that the monetary authority is losing its grip on infla-
tion. That yield increase could act as a brake on any loose monetary policy stance.
Conversely, the vigilantes may push long-term rates down by increasing their demand
for long-dated government bonds if they expect that tight monetary policy is likely
to cause a sharp slowdown in the economy, thereby loosening monetary conditions
for long-term borrowers in the economy.
     A credible monetary policy framework and authority will tend not to require the
vigilantes to do the work for it.
     In very extreme instances, there may be occasions in which the demand for money
becomes infinitely elastic—that is, where the demand curve is horizontal and individ-
uals are willing to hold additional money balances without any change in the interest
rate—so that further injections of money into the economy will not serve to further
lower interest rates or affect real activity. This is known as a liquidity trap. In this
extreme circumstance, monetary policy can become completely ineffective. The eco-
nomic conditions for a liquidity trap are associated with the phenomenon of deflation.

Interest Rate Adjustment in a Deflationary Environment and Quantitative Easing as
a Response
Deflation is a pervasive and persistent fall in a general price index and is more difficult
for conventional monetary policy to deal with than inflation. This is because cutting
nominal interest rates much below zero to stimulate the economy is difficult. For
example, policy interest rates were cut below zero in several European countries in
2014 and subsequently in Japan in 2016. At this point, the economic conditions for
a liquidity trap arise.
    Deflation raises the real value of debt, while the persistent fall in prices can
encourage consumers to put off consumption today, leading to a fall in demand that
leads to further deflationary pressure. Thus a deflationary “trap” can develop, which
is characterized by weak consumption growth, falling prices, and increases in real
debt levels. Japan eventually found itself in such a position following the collapse of
its property bubble in the early 1990s.
    If conventional monetary policy—the adjustment of short-term interest rates—is
no longer capable of stimulating the economy once the zero or even negative nominal
interest rate bound has been reached, is monetary policy useless?

                             In the aftermath of the collapse of the high-tech bubble in November 2002, Federal
                          Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke gave a speech entitled “Deflation: Making Sure ‘It’
                          Doesn’t Happen Here.” In this speech, Bernanke stated that inflation was always and
                          everywhere a monetary phenomenon, and he expressed great confidence that by
                          expanding the money supply by various means (including dropping it out of a heli-
                          copter on the population below), the Federal Reserve as the sole supplier of money
                          could always engineer positive inflation in the US economy. He said:
                                 I am confident that the Fed would take whatever means necessary to prevent
                                 significant deflation in the United States and, moreover, that the US central
                                 bank, in cooperation with other parts of the government as needed, has
                                 sufficient policy instruments to ensure that any deflation that might occur
                                 would be both mild and brief.
                              Following the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis, a number of governments along
                          with their central banks cut rates to (near) zero, including those in the United States
                          and the United Kingdom. However, there was concern that the underlying economies
                          might not respond to this drastic monetary medicine, mainly because the related
                          banking crisis had caused banks to reduce their lending drastically. To kick-start the
                          process, both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England effectively printed money
                          and pumped it into their respective economies. This “unconventional” approach to
                          monetary policy, known as quantitative easing (QE), is operationally similar to open
                          market purchase operations but is conducted on a much larger scale.
                              The additional reserves created by central banks in a policy of quantitative eas-
                          ing can be used to buy any assets. The Bank of England chose to buy gilts (bonds
                          issued by the UK government), where the focus was on gilts with three to five years
                          maturity. The idea was that this additional reserve would kick-start lending, causing
                          broad money growth to expand, which would eventually lead to an increase in real
                          economic activity. But there is no guarantee that banks will respond in this way. In
                          a difficult economic climate, it may be better to hold excess reserves rather than to
                          lend to households and businesses that may default.
                              In the United States, the formal plan for QE mainly involved the purchase of
                          mortgage bonds issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Part of the
                          intention was to push down mortgage rates to support the US housing market, as
                          well as to increase the growth rate of broad money. Before implementing this formal
                          program, the Federal Reserve intervened in several other markets that were failing
                          for lack of liquidity, including interbank markets and the commercial paper market.
                          These interventions had a similar effect on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and
                          the money supply as the later QE program.
                              This first round of QE by the Federal Reserve was then followed by another round
                          of QE, known as QE2. In November 2010, the Federal Reserve judged that the US
                          economy had not responded sufficiently to the first round of QE (QE1). The Fed
                          announced that it would create $600 billion and use this money to purchase long-dated
                          US Treasuries in equal tranches over the following eight months. The purpose of
                          QE2 was to ensure that long bond yields remained low to encourage businesses and
                          households to borrow for investment and consumption purposes, respectively.
                              The final round of QE, known as QE3, was implemented in September 2012 to
                          provide $40 billion per month to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities “until
                          the labor market improved substantially.” QE3 lasted until December 2013, when the
                          Federal Reserve announced it was tapering back on these purchases. These purchases,
                          and quantitative easing, ended 10 months later in October 2014.

    As long as central banks have the appropriate authority from the government,
they can purchase any assets in a quantitative easing program. But the risks involved
in purchasing assets with credit risk should be clear. In the end, the central bank is
just a special bank. If it accumulates bad assets that then turn out to create losses, it
could face a fatal loss of confidence in its main product: fiat money.

Limitations of Monetary Policy: Summary
The ultimate problem for monetary authorities as they try to manipulate the supply
of money to influence the real economy is that they cannot control the amount of
money that households and corporations put in banks on deposit, nor can they easily
control the willingness of banks to create money by expanding credit. Taken together,
this also means that they cannot always control the money supply. Therefore, there
are definite limits to the power of monetary policy.

EXAMPLE 3

   The Limits of Monetary Policy: The Case of Japan
   The Background
   Between the 1950s and 1980s, Japan’s economy achieved faster real growth than
   any other G–7 economy. But the terrific success of the economy sowed the seeds
   of the problems that were to follow. The very high real growth rates achieved by
   Japan over four decades became built into asset prices, particularly equity and
   commercial property prices. Toward the end of the 1980s, asset prices rose to
   even higher levels when the BoJ followed a very easy monetary policy as it tried
   to prevent the Japanese yen from appreciating too much against the US dollar.
   However, when interest rates went up in 1989–1990 and the economy slowed,
   investors eventually came to believe that the growth assumptions that were built
   into asset prices and other aspects of the Japanese economy were unrealistic.
   This realization caused Japanese asset prices to collapse. For example, the Nikkei
   225 stock market index reached 38,915 in 1989; by the end of March 2003, it
   had fallen by 80 percent to 7,972. The collapse in asset prices caused wealth to
   decline dramatically. Consumer confidence understandably fell sharply too, and
   consumption growth slowed. Corporate spending also fell, while bank lending
   contracted sharply in the weak economic climate. Although many of these
   phenomena are apparent in all recessions, the situation was made worse when
   deflation set in. In an environment when prices are falling, consumers may put
   off discretionary spending today until tomorrow; by doing this, however, they
   exacerbate the deflationary environment. Deflation also raises the real value of
   debts; as deflation takes hold, borrowers find the real value of their debts rising
   and may try to increase their savings accordingly. Once again, such actions
   exacerbate the recessionary conditions.

   The Monetary Policy Response
   Faced with such a downturn, the conventional monetary policy response is to
   cut interest rates to try to stimulate real economic activity. The Japanese central
   bank, the BoJ, cut rates from 8 percent in 1990 to 1 percent by 1996. By February
   2001, the Japanese policy rate was cut to zero where it stayed.
       Once rates are at or near zero, there are two broad approaches suggested by
   theory, though the two are usually complementary. First, the central bank can
   try to convince markets that interest rates will remain low for a long time, even
   after the economy and inflation pick up. This will tend to lower interest rates
   along the yield curve. Second, the central bank can try to increase the money

                             supply by purchasing assets from the private sector, so-called quantitative eas-
                             ing. The BoJ did both in 2001. It embarked on a program of quantitative easing
                             supplemented by an explicit promise not to raise short-term interest rates until
                             deflation had given way to inflation.
                                 Quantitative easing simply involves the printing of money by the central
                             bank. In practice, this involved the BoJ using open market operations to add
                             reserves to the banking system through the direct purchase of government
                             securities in the open market.
                                 The reserve levels became the new target. The BoJ’s monetary policy com-
                             mittee determined the level of reserves and the quantity of bond purchases that
                             should be undertaken, rather than voting on the policy rate.
                                 The success of this policy is difficult to judge. As Exhibit 7 shows, although
                             deflation turned to inflation for a while, it returned to deflation in 2008–2009
                             when the Japanese economy suffered a sharp recession along with much of the
                             rest of the world. At that time, having reversed its QE policy during 2004–2008
                             by reducing its bond holdings, the BoJ began to buy again.
                                 The BoJ ramped up its asset purchases starting in 2013, when other central
                             banks began to unwind their QE programs. At the beginning of 2013, BoJ Assets
                             to Japanese GDP were approximately 30 percent, but rose to more than 170
                             percent in 2020. Economists debate the point, but arguably, even the BoJ’s much
                             larger program of QE has not been able to eliminate deflation. The Japanese
                             experience suggests that there may be limits to the power of monetary policy.

QUESTION SET


  1. If an economy’s trend GDP growth rate is 3 percent and its central
     bank has a 2 percent inflation target, which policy rate is most consistent
     with an expansionary monetary policy?
      A. 4 percent
      B. 5 percent
      C. 6 percent
     Solution:
     A is correct. The neutral rate of interest, which in this example is 5 percent,
     is considered to be that rate of interest that neither spurs on nor slows down
     the underlying economy. As such, when policy rates are above the neutral
     rate, monetary policy is contractionary; when they are below the neutral
     rate, monetary policy is expansionary. It has two components: the real trend
     rate of growth of the underlying economy (in this example, 3 percent) and
     long-run expected inflation (in this example, 2 percent).

  2. An increase in a central bank’s policy rate might be expected to reduce infla-
     tionary pressures by:
      A. reducing consumer demand.
      B. reducing the foreign exchange value of the currency.
      C. driving up asset prices leading to an increase in personal sector
         wealth.
     Solution:
     A is correct. If an increase in the central bank’s policy rate is successful-
     ly transmitted through the money markets to other parts of the financial
     sector, consumer demand might decline as the rate of interest on mortgages
     and other credit rises. This decline in consumer demand should, all other
     things being equal and among other affects, lead to a reduction in upward
     pressure on consumer prices.

  3. Which of the following statements best describes a fundamental limitation
     of monetary policy? Monetary policy is limited because central bankers:
      A. cannot control the inflation rate perfectly.
      B. are appointed by politicians and are therefore never truly independent.
      C. cannot control the amount of money that economic agents put in
         banks, nor the willingness of banks to make loans.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Central bankers do not control the decisions of individuals and
     banks that can influence the money creation process.

  4. In theory, setting the policy rate equal to the neutral interest rate should
     promote:
      A. stable inflation.
      B. balanced budgets.

                                   C. greater employment.
                                  Solution:
                                  A is correct. The neutral rate of interest is that rate of interest that neither
                                  stimulates nor slows down the underlying economy. The neutral rate should
                                  be consistent with stable long-run inflation.




              5           INTERACTION OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY

                                          explain the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy



                          The Relationship Between Monetary and Fiscal Policy
                          Both monetary and fiscal policies can be used to try to influence the macroeconomy.
                          But the impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand may differ depending on the
                          fiscal policy stance. Conversely, the impact of fiscal policy might vary under various
                          alternative monetary policy conditions. Clearly, policy makers need to understand this
                          interaction. For example, they need to consider the impact of changes to the budget
                          when monetary policy is accommodative as opposed to when it is restrictive: Can we
                          expect the same impact on aggregate demand in both situations?
                              Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand, they do
                          so through differing channels with differing impact on the composition of aggregate
                          demand. The two policies are not interchangeable. Consider the following cases in
                          which the assumption is made that wages and prices are rigid:
                              ■    Easy fiscal policy/tight monetary policy: If taxes are cut or government
                                   spending rises, the expansionary fiscal policy will lead to a rise in aggregate
                                   output. If this is accompanied by a reduction in money supply to offset the
                                   fiscal expansion, then interest rates will rise and have a negative effect on
                                   private sector demand. We have higher output and higher interest rates, and
                                   government spending will be a larger proportion of overall national income.
                              ■    Tight fiscal policy/easy monetary policy: If a fiscal contraction is accom-
                                   panied by expansionary monetary policy and low interest rates, then the
                                   private sector will be stimulated and will rise as a share of GDP, while the
                                   public sector will shrink.
                              ■    Easy monetary policy/easy fiscal policy: If both fiscal and monetary policy
                                   are easy, then the joint impact will be highly expansionary—leading to a rise
                                   in aggregate demand, lower interest rates (at least if the monetary impact is
                                   larger), and growing private and public sectors.
                              ■    Tight monetary policy/tight fiscal policy: Interest rates rise (at least if the
                                   monetary impact on interest rates is larger) and reduce private demand. At
                                   the same time, higher taxes and falling government spending lead to a drop
                                   in aggregate demand from both public and private sectors.

Factors Influencing the Mix of Fiscal and Monetary Policy
Although governments are concerned about stabilizing the level of aggregate demand
at close to the full employment level, they are also concerned with the growth of
potential output. To this end, encouraging private investment will be important. It
may best be achieved by accommodative monetary policy with low interest rates and
a tight fiscal policy to ensure free resources for a growing private sector.
    At other times, the lack of a good quality, trained workforce—or perhaps a modern
capital infrastructure—will be seen as an impediment to growth; thus, an expansion
in government spending in these areas may be seen as a high priority. If taxes are not
raised to pay for this, then the fiscal stance will be expansionary. If a loose monetary
policy is chosen to accompany this expansionary spending, then it is possible that
inflation may be induced. Of course, it is an open question as to whether policy makers
can judge the appropriate levels of interest rates or fiscal spending levels.
    Clearly, the mix of policies will be heavily influenced by the political context. A
weak government may raise spending to accommodate the demands of competing
vested interests (e.g., subsidies to particular sectors, such as agriculture in the EU), and
thus a restrictive monetary policy may be needed to hold back the possibly inflationary
growth in aggregate demand through raised interest rates and less credit availability.
    Both fiscal and monetary policies suffer from the lack of precise knowledge of
where the economy is today, because data initially appear to be subject to revision
and to have a time lag. However, fiscal policy suffers from two further issues with
regard to its use in the short run.
    As we saw earlier, it is difficult to implement quickly because spending on capital
projects takes time to plan, procure, and put into practice. In addition, it is politically
easier to loosen fiscal policy than to tighten it; in many cases, automatic stabilizers
are the source of fiscal tightening, because tax rates are not changing and political
opposition is muted. Similarly, the independence of many central banks means that
decisions on raising interest rates are outside the hands of politicians and thus can
be taken more easily.
    The interaction between monetary and fiscal policies was implicit in our discussion
of Ricardian equivalence because if tax cuts have no impact on private spending as
individuals anticipate future higher taxes, then clearly this may lead policy makers
to favor monetary tools.
    Ultimately, the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in practice is an empirical
question, which we also touched on earlier. In their detailed research paper using the
International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’S) Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model,
IMF researchers examined four forms of coordinated global fiscal loosening over a
two-year period, which will be reversed gradually after the two years are completed.
These are:
    ■   an increase in social transfers to all households,
    ■   a decrease in tax on labor income,
    ■   a rise in government investment expenditure, and
    ■   a rise in transfers to the poorest in society.
   The two types of monetary policy responses considered are:
    ■   no monetary accommodation, so rising aggregate demand leads to higher
        interest rates immediately; or
    ■   interest rates are kept unchanged (accommodative policy) for the two years.

                              The following important policy conclusions from this study emphasize the role
                          of policy interactions:
                              ■   No monetary accommodation: Government spending increases have a much
                                  bigger effect (six times bigger) on GDP than similar size social transfers
                                  because the latter are not considered to be permanent, although real inter-
                                  est rates rise as monetary authorities react to rises in aggregate demand
                                  and inflation. Targeted social transfers to the poorest citizens have double
                                  the effect of the non-targeted transfers, while labor tax reductions have a
                                  slightly bigger impact than the latter.
                              ■   Monetary accommodation: Except for the case of the cut in labor taxes,
                                  fiscal multipliers are now much larger than when there is no monetary
                                  accommodation. The cumulative multiplier (i.e., the cumulative effect on
                                  real GDP over the two years divided by the percentage of GDP, which is a
                                  fiscal stimulus) is now 3.9 for government expenditure compared with 1.6
                                  with no monetary accommodation. The corresponding numbers for targeted
                                  social transfer payments are 0.5 without monetary accommodation and 1.7
                                  with it. The larger multiplier effects with monetary accommodation result
                                  from rises in aggregate demand and inflation, leading to falls in real interest
                                  rates and additional private sector spending (e.g., on investment goods).
                                  Labor tax cuts are less positive.


                          Quantitative Easing and Policy Interaction
                          What about the scenario of zero interest rates and deflation? Fiscal stimulus should
                          still raise demand and inflation, lowering real interest rates and stimulating private
                          sector demand. We saw earlier that quantitative easing was a feature of major econ-
                          omies following the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis. This involved the purchase
                          of government or private securities by the central bank from individuals, institutions,
                          or banks and substituting central bank balances for those securities. The ultimate aim
                          was for recipients to subsequently increase expenditures, lending or borrowing in the
                          face of raised cash balances and lower interest rates.
                               If the central bank purchases government securities on a large scale, it is effectively
                          funding the budget deficit and the independence of monetary policy is an illusion.
                          This so-called printing of money is feared by many economists as the monetization of
                          the government deficit. Note that it is unrelated to the conventional inflation target
                          of central banks, such as the Bank of England. Some economists question whether
                          an independent central bank should engage in such activity.

                          The Importance of Credibility and Commitment
                          The IMF model implies that if governments run persistently high budget deficits, real
                          interest rates rise and crowd out private investment, reducing each country’s productive
                          potential. As individuals realize that deficits will persist, inflation expectations and
                          long-term interest rates rise: This reduces the effect of the stimulus by half.
                              Further, if there is a real lack of commitment to fiscal discipline over the longer
                          term, (e.g., because of aging populations) and the ratio of government debt to GDP
                          rose by 10 percentage points permanently in the United States alone, then world real
                          interest rates would rise by 0.14 percent—leading to a 0.6 percent permanent fall in
                          world GDP.

QUESTION SET


  1. In a world in which Ricardian equivalence holds, governments
     would most likely prefer to use monetary rather than fiscal policy because
     under Ricardian equivalence:
      A. real interest rates have a more powerful effect on the real economy.
      B. the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is better understood.
      C. the future impact of fiscal policy changes are fully discounted by eco-
         nomic agents.
     Solution:
     C is correct. If Ricardian equivalence holds, then economic agents anticipate
     that the consequence of any current tax cut will be future tax rises, which
     leads them to increase their saving in anticipation of this so that the tax cut
     has little effect on consumption and investment decisions. Governments
     would be forced to use monetary policy to affect the real economy on the
     assumption that money neutrality did not hold in the short term.

  2. If fiscal policy is easy and monetary policy tight, then:
      A. interest rates would tend to fall, reinforcing the fiscal policy stance.
      B. the government sector would tend to shrink as a proportion of total
         GDP.
      C. the government sector would tend to expand as a proportion of total
         GDP.
     Solution:
     C is correct. With a tight monetary policy, real interest rates should rise
     and reduce private sector activity, which could be at least partially offset by
     an expansion in government activity via the loosening of fiscal policy. The
     net effect, however, would be an expansion in the size of the public sector
     relative to the private sector.

  3. Which of the following has the greatest impact on aggregate demand ac-
     cording to an IMF study? 1 percent of GDP stimulus in:
      A. government spending
      B. rise in transfer benefits
      C. cut in labor income tax across all income levels
     Solution:
     A is correct. The study clearly showed that direct spending by the govern-
     ment leads to a larger impact on GDP than changes in taxes or benefits.

  4. Given an independent central bank, monetary policy actions are more likely
     than fiscal policy actions to be:
      A. implementable quickly.
      B. effective when a specific group is targeted.
      C. effective when combating a deflationary economy.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Monetary actions may face fewer delays to taking action than
     fiscal policy, especially when the central bank is independent.

                             5. Which policy alternative is most likely to be effective for growing both the
                                public and private sectors?
                                A. Easy fiscal/easy monetary policy
                                B. Easy fiscal/tight monetary policy
                                 C. Tight fiscal/tight monetary policy
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. If both fiscal and monetary policies are “easy,” then the joint
                                impact will be highly expansionary, leading to a rise in aggregate demand,
                                low interest rates, and growing private and public sectors.

   SOLUTIONS
1. A is correct. Investment is expected to move inversely with the official policy
   rate.

2. A is correct. Such action would tend to constrict the money supply and increase
   interest rates, all else being equal.

3. C is correct. The purchase of government bonds through open market operations
   increases banking reserves and the money supply; it is consistent with an expan-
   sionary monetary policy.

4. B is correct. A central bank would decrease an official interest rate to stimulate
   the economy. The setting in which an official interest rate is lowered to zero (or
   even slightly below zero) without stimulating economic growth suggests that
   there are limits to monetary policy.

5. C is correct. Raising reserve requirements should slow money supply growth.

6. C is correct. Deflation poses a challenge to conventional monetary policy because
   once the central bank has cut nominal interest rates to zero (or slightly less than
   zero) to stimulate the economy, they cannot cut them further.

7. A is correct. The inability to determine exactly the neutral rate of interest does
   not necessarily limit the power of monetary policy.

8. B is correct. Quantitative easing is an example of an expansionary monetary
   policy stance. It attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the
   money supply.

                             LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                                 ■   Geopolitics is the study of how geography affects politics and
                                     international relations. Within the field of geopolitics, analysts
                                     study actors—the individuals, organizations, companies, and national
                                     governments that carry out political, economic, and financial activi-
                                     ties—and how they interact with one another.
                                 ■   State actors can be cooperative or non-cooperative. A country may
                                     want to cooperate with its neighbors or with other state actors for
                                     many reasons. These reasons are typically defined by a country’s
                                     national interest—its goals and ambitions—whether they be military,
                                     economic, or cultural.
                                 ■   The cooperation and engagement among countries is also affected by
                                     its resource endowment, standardization of the rules of engagement,
                                     and cultural factors and soft power.
                                 ■   A country’s national interest can be viewed as a hierarchy of factors,
                                     with those essential for survival at the top of the hierarchy and nice-
                                     but-not-essential elements lower in the hierarchy. Governments use
                                     the hierarchy of interests to guide their behavior.
                                 ■   Political cooperation versus non-cooperation is only one lens through
                                     which geopolitical actors engage with the world, but it is an important
                                     one for understanding countries’ priorities.
                                 ■   Globalization is marked by economic and financial cooperation,
                                     including the active trade of goods and services, capital flows, cur-
                                     rency exchange, and cultural and information exchange. By contrast,
                                     antiglobalization or nationalism is the promotion of a country’s own
                                     economic interests to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of
                                     other nations. Nationalism is marked by limited economic and finan-
                                     cial cooperation.
                                 ■   Globalization provides potential gains, such as:

                                     ●   increased profits—through increasing sales and/or reducing costs,

                                     ●   access to resources—market access and investment opportunities,
                                         and
                                     ●   intrinsic gains—an improved quality of life.
                                 ■   Globalization also has some potential drawbacks, such as:

                                     ●   unequal economic and financial gains,

                                     ●   interdependence that can lead to supply chain disruption, and
                                     ●   possible exploitation of social and environmental resources.
                                 ■   The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) main mandate is to ensure
                                     the stability of the international monetary system, the system of
                                     exchange rates and international payments that enables countries to
                                     buy goods and services from each other.

Introduction                                                                           143


      ■   A geopolitical framework for analysis includes four archetypes of
          country behavior: autarky, hegemony, multilateralism, and bilateral-
          ism. Each archetype has its own costs, benefits, and trade-offs with
          respect to geopolitical risk.
      ■   Geopolitical risk is the risk associated with tensions or actions
          between actors (state and non-state) that affect the normal and
          peaceful course of international relations. Geopolitical risk tends to
          rise when the geographic and political factors underpinning country
          relations shift.
      ■   The tools of geopolitics may be separated into the following three
          types:

           ●   national security tools,

           ●   economic tools, and
           ●   financial tools.
      ■   The most extreme example of a national security tool is that of armed
          conflict. Espionage is an indirect national security tool. Military alli-
          ances are often used either to aid in direct conflict or to deter conflict
          from arising in the first place.
      ■   Economic tools are used to reinforce a cooperative or non-cooperative
          stance through economic means. Among state actors, economic tools
          can include multilateral trade agreements or the global harmonization
          of tariff rules. Economic tools also can be non-cooperative in nature.
          Nationalization is a non-cooperative approach to asserting economic
          control.
      ■   Financial tools are the actions used to reinforce a cooperative or
          non-cooperative stance through financial mechanisms. Examples of
          cooperative financial tools include the free exchange of currencies
          across borders and allowing foreign investment. Examples of non-co-
          operative financial tools include limiting access to local currency
          markets and restricting foreign investment.
      ■   There are three basic types of geopolitical risk:

           ●   event risk,

           ●   exogenous risk, and
           ●   thematic risk.
      ■   Event risk evolves around set dates known in advance. Political events,
          for example, often result in changes to investor expectations related to
          a country’s cooperative stance. Brexit is an example of event risk.
      ■   Exogenous risk is a sudden or unanticipated risk that can affect either
          a country’s cooperative stance, the ability of non-state actors to glo-
          balize, or both. Examples include sudden uprisings, invasions, or the
          aftermath of natural disasters.
      ■   Thematic risks are known risks that evolve and expand over time.
          Climate change, cyber threats, and the ongoing threat of terrorism fall
          into this category.
      ■   To make an assessment, an investor considers geopolitical risk in
          terms of the following three areas:

                                     ●   velocity (speed) of its impact, and
                                     ●   size and nature of that impact.
                                 ■   Geopolitical risks seldom develop in linear fashion, making it diffi-
                                     cult to monitor and forecast their likelihood, velocity, and size and
                                     nature of impact on a portfolio. As a result, many investors deploy an
                                     approach that includes scenario building and signposting rather than a
                                     single point forecast.
                                 ■   Investors study geopolitical risk because it has a tangible impact on
                                     investment outcomes. On a macroeconomic level, these risks can
                                     affect capital markets conditions, such as economic growth, interest
                                     rates, and market volatility.
                                 ■   Changes in capital markets conditions can have an important influ-
                                     ence on asset allocation decisions, including an investor’s choice of
                                     geographic exposures.
                                 ■   On a portfolio level, geopolitical risk can influence the appropriateness
                                     of an investment security or strategy for an investor’s goals, risk toler-
                                     ance, and time horizon.




              2           NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND POLITICAL
                          COOPERATION

                                         describe geopolitics from a cooperation versus competition
                                         perspective

                          The international environment is constantly evolving. Such trends as the growth of
                          emerging market economies, globalization, and the rise of populism affect the range of
                          opportunities and threats that companies, industries, nations, and regional groups face.
                          Geopolitics is the study of how geography affects politics and international relations.
                          Within the field of geopolitics, analysts study actors—the individuals, organizations,
                          companies, and national governments that carry out political, economic, and financial
                          activities—and how they interact with one another. The role of state and non-state
                          actors is discussed in the following section.


                          State and Non-State Actors
                          Relationships within and among countries can be complex. To begin, many actors
                          influence international relations, political developments, and economic affairs. In
                          the introduction, we defined actors as the individuals, organizations, companies, and
                          national governments that carry out political, economic, and financial activities. This
                          definition can be divided into two types of actors relevant for geopolitical risk: state
                          actors and non-state actors. State actors are typically national governments, political
                          organizations, or country leaders that exert authority over a country’s national security
                          and resources. The South African president, sultan of Brunei, Malaysia’s parliament,
                          and the British Prime minister are all examples of state actors. Non-state actors are
                          those that participate in global political, economic, or financial affairs but do not

directly control national security or country resources. Examples of non-state actors
are non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational companies, charities, and
even influential individuals, such as business leaders or cultural icons.
    These actors are influenced not only by their relationship with one another but
also by factors affecting their other allies and adversaries. For example, if Country
A has a cooperative relationship with Country B but Country B attacks Country C,
a close ally of Country A, then the relationship between Countries A and B may
become strained or even broken. The opposite is also true: A country’s cooperation
across many political, economic, or financial channels may increase trust over time.
As a result, the international system is composed of multifaceted webs of affairs that
can shape events and decisions as well as economic and market outcomes. Although
a “one-size-fits-all” model does not exist for geopolitical actors, understanding and
categorizing the threats and opportunities that a country faces may help us to gauge
the likelihood that geopolitical risk will arise.
    Countries and their governments are heavily influenced by economic, financial, and
national security considerations as well as by social and cultural factors and non-state
actors. In fact, economic and financial considerations are inextricably linked with
a country’s national interest and political dynamic. That said, it is useful to isolate
one of these areas—national actors and political cooperation—as a starting point in
understanding actors’ interwoven goals and the way they may affect geopolitical risk.
In the next section, we will develop a sense of state actors and their motivations for
cooperation (versus non-cooperation) before adding layers of geopolitical risk analysis.


Features of Political Cooperation
At the highest level, relations between countries or national governments (state actors)
can be cooperative or competitive in nature. Cooperation is the process by which
countries work together toward some shared goal or purpose. These goals may, and
often do, vary widely—from strategic or military concerns to economic influence
or cultural preferences. Given the expansive nature of country goals and interests,
their interactions with one another also may be complex, generating the potential for
geopolitical risk to arise.
    We begin that framework by exploring one specific type of cooperation—political
cooperation—which is the degree to which countries work toward agreements on
rules and standardization for the activities and interactions between them. Within
this context, a cooperative country is one that engages and reciprocates in rules
standardization; harmonization of tariffs; and international agreements on trade, immi-
gration, or regulation and that also allows for the free flow of information, including
technology transfer. In contrast, a non-cooperative country is one with inconsistent
and even arbitrary rules; restricted movement of goods, services, people, and capital
across borders; retaliation; and limited technology exchange. We show the degree of
political cooperation in Exhibit 1

                          A country may want to cooperate with its neighbors or with other state actors for
                          many reasons. These reasons are typically defined by a country’s national interest—its
                          goals and ambitions—whether they be military, economic, or cultural.

                          National Security or Military Interest
                          National security or national defense involves protecting a country, including its cit-
                          izens, economy, and institutions, from external threat. These threats may be broad
                          in nature—from military attacks and terrorism, to crime, cybersecurity, and even
                          natural disasters.
                              Geographic factors play an important role in shaping a country’s approach to
                          national security and the extent to which it will choose a cooperative approach.
                          Landlocked countries, such as Switzerland, rely extensively on their neighbors for
                          access to vital resources. This reliance may make cooperation more important for
                          sustaining international access and growth or even for survival. By the same token,
                          countries highly connected to trade routes, such as Singapore, or countries acting as
                          a conduit for trade, such as Panama, may use their geographic location as a lever of
                          power in broader international dynamics.

                          Economic Interest
                          Over time, the concept of national security has expanded to include economic factors,
                          including access to such resources as energy, food, or water. On a domestic level,
                          growing national wealth and limiting income inequality can contribute to social sta-
                          bility, another important component of national security. On the international level,
                          the ability of national firms to operate on a global scale is increasingly important as
                          well. In this context, countries that cooperate in support of their economic interest
                          are likely focused on one of two factors: Either they would like to secure essential
                          resources through trade, or they would like to level the global playing field for their
                          companies or industries through standardization.

      B. False
     Solution:
     B is correct. Geographic factors play an important role in shaping a coun-
     try’s approach to national security and the extent to which it will choose a
     cooperative approach. A country with limited access to resources because
     of its geographic characteristics might be more inclined to cooperate as
     it needs access to resources to thrive, whereas a country rich in internal
     resources might use its resources as leverage to influence international dy-
     namics. Countries with direct access to the sea have an advantage related to
     trade and transport as well as the natural resources provided by the ocean.

     cused include____ and___.
     Solution:
     Two factors on which a cooperative country is likely focused include trade
     and standardization.



Resource Endowment, Standardization, and Soft Power
The cooperation and engagement among countries is also affected by its resource
endowment, standardization of the rules of engagement, and cultural factors and soft
power. These factors are examined in the section that follows.

Geophysical Resource Endowment
At a basic level, geophysical resource endowment includes such factors as livable
geography and climate as well as access to food and water, which are necessary for
sustainable growth. Geophysical resource endowment is highly unequal among
countries. Some countries, such as the United States, Russia, Australia, and China,
are relatively self-sufficient in their resource use. Others, such as Western Europe,
Japan, and Turkey, are highly reliant on others for key factors of production, such as
fossil fuels. Still others, such as Saudi Arabia, have a plentiful endowment of fossil
fuels but rely on others for many basic needs.
     These different starting points create power dynamics that can affect the terms of
engagement between states. A country heavily endowed with a resource may find itself
with more political leverage when dealing with another country in desperate need
of that resource. At the same time, a resource-rich country may become vulnerable
if the use or sale of the resource benefits certain groups more than others, therefore
contributing to internal political instability.

Standardization
Economic and financial activities may cross borders with or without explicit gov-
ernment support. As they do, governments have more incentive to cooperate with
others in standardizing the rules of engagement. Standardization is the process of
creating protocols for the production, sale, transport, or use of a product or service.
Standardization occurs when relevant parties agree to follow these protocols together.
It helps support expanded economic and financial activities across borders, such as

                                   also be driven by non-state entities, such as industry groups or organizations. Exhibit

                                   Cultural Considerations and Soft Power
                                   Finally, countries may have cultural reasons for cooperating with others. These could
                                   be historical in nature, such as long-standing political ties, immigration patterns,
                                   shared experiences, or cultural similarities. In other cases, countries may engage
                                   in soft power, a means of influencing another country’s decisions without force or
                                   coercion. Soft power can be built over time through such actions as cultural programs,
                                   advertisement, travel grants, and university exchange. For example, the European
                                   Union (EU) Erasmus+ program provides funding for exchange programs in educa-
                                   tion and sport to drive social inclusion and participation between participants from
                                   different countries and also to promote such priority policies as the EU’s green and
                                   digital transitions. In another example, countries like South Korea advertise visiting
                                   Seoul, the country’s capital city, in subway systems globally. These advertisements use
                                   popular Korean-made products, musical acts, and actors to encourage interaction
                                   with Korean culture and business.


                                   The Role of Institutions
                                   An institution is an established organization or practice in a society or culture. An
                                   institution can be a formal structure, such as a university, organization, or process
                                   backed by law; or, it can be informal, such as customs or behavioral patterns import-
                                   ant to a society. Institutions can, but need not be, formed by national governments.
                                   Examples of institutions include NGOs, charities, religious customs, family units, the
                                   media, political parties, and educational practice.

National Governments and Political Cooperation                                                                              149


    Generally, strong institutions contribute to more stable internal and external
political forces. That consistency, in turn, gives a country more opportunity to develop
cooperative relationships. Countries with strong institutions—including organizations
and structures promoting government accountability, rule of law, and property rights—
allow them to act with more authority and independence in the international space.
Stronger institutions also make cooperative relationships more durable. By integrating
a cooperative relationship in multiple layers of society, strong institutions can reduce
the likelihood that a country defects from its cooperative roles.


Hierarchy of Interests and Costs of Cooperation
The national interest of a country is its set of goals and ambitions. For some countries,
national interest is viewed primarily in geospatial terms—the need for self-determina-
tion, survival as a nation state, the need for clear national borders, or expansion of
the nation state. For others, national interest incorporates a wide array of interrelated
factors, including the economic and social considerations discussed earlier. This broad
approach can create conflicts among a country’s many important needs, which com-
plicates the assessment of geopolitical actors and their motivations.
     We can think of a country’s national interest as a hierarchy of factors, with those
essential for survival at the top of the hierarchy and nice-but-not-essential elements
lower in the hierarchy. Governments use the hierarchy of interests to guide their
behavior. They will choose to cooperate where it benefits the nation-state, but when
two needs result in conflicting cooperation tactics, those higher on the hierarchy are
prioritized. For example, cooperation in the form of tariff harmonization may benefit
the country on a stand-alone basis; however, if those countries are in a military con-
flict, then there is a higher cost to cooperation. In this case, if military determination
is higher on the countries’ hierarchies, then cooperation may not be in their national
interest, despite the potential benefits.
     Exhibit 3 shows how countries prioritize their hierarchy of interests. Every country
has different resources, goals, and leadership and thus different priorities, as well. In
the exhibit, Country A prioritizes access to food and water. In contrast, Country B,
prioritizes independence from foreign influence. Additionally, these priorities may
shift as political leadership turns over or as global events change. For investors, it
is important to understand how these resources, goals, and leadership styles may
interact or even conflict with one another over time. When countries’ goals misalign
or change, it may give rise to geopolitical risk.

                          Power of the Decision Maker
                          Some elements on the hierarchy of national interests may appear clear-cut; securing
                          access to food and water may take precedence over funding a cultural program, for
                          example. However, as basic societal needs are met, the hierarchy of national interests
                          can become more subjective. One government may treat the prioritization of some
                          interests—such as military buildup or providing health care—very differently from
                          its predecessor. How governments weigh those issues will determine the depth and
                          nature of political cooperation.
                              The length of a country’s political cycle has an important impact on priority des-
                          ignation. Many countries have political cycles of just a few years, which means that
                          long-term risks like climate change or addressing income inequality can be difficult
                          to prioritize against projects or goals that can be achieved in a short-term horizon.
                          Intrinsic in this reality is that governmental decision makers, whether political par-
                          ties or individuals, have their own set of influences and needs. Although we will not
                          explore this idea in depth, it is important to acknowledge that, for the purpose of
                          geopolitical risk analysis, decision makers’ motivations can affect a country’s coop-
                          erative and non-cooperative choices. This introduces a factor of psychology and
                          non-predictability into choices along the hierarchy of a nation’s needs that can shape
                          geopolitical relationships.

                           EXAMPLE 3

                             Country’s Political Cycle

                             1. True or false: The length of a country’s political cycle does not affect its
                                priority designation.

                                Explain your reasoning.
                                 A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. The length of a country’s political cycle has an important im-
                                pact on priority designation as governments with shorter cycles have little
                                incentive to focus on longer-term priorities, even if those priorities would
                                be beneficial for society. Australia, for example, has shorter than average
                                parliamentary terms, which could potentially affect governmental priorities.



                          Political Non-Cooperation
                          We consider political cooperation and non-cooperation as existing along a spectrum.
                          While it is in some countries’ interest to be highly politically cooperative, for others
                          it is less essential. Over time, most countries cooperate on standardized rules on an
                          international scale. In some instances of extreme non-cooperation, however, countries’
                          political self-determination is more important than the benefits of any cooperative
                          actions. These extreme cases are rare, not least because the importance of cooperation
                          for other state actors may result in attempts to coerce non-cooperative state actors
                          into participation.

INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST VENEZUELA (2015–)

  The United States has had concerns about Venezuelan narcotics trafficking since
  2005 and Venezuela’s lack of cooperation in combatting terrorism since 2006.
  With support from Congress and in response to increasing political repression
  in Venezuela, US President Obama levied additional sanctions for human rights
  abuses, corruption, and antidemocratic actions. The European Union urged
  Venezuelan officials to work toward political reconciliation but ultimately joined
  the United States in targeted sanctions to encourage a credible and meaningful
  process toward re-starting cooperation.
      Throughout this time, sanctions have included targeted restrictions on
  Venezuelan officials, blocking financial transactions, and an embargo on the oil
  sector, which is highly important to the country’s economy. Some politicians
  continue to support economic sanctions as a means to pressure the Venezuelan
  government to meet international standards on human rights and political
  cooperation. Others are concerned about the increasing humanitarian cost of
  those sanctions.
      Venezuela’s non-cooperative stance in the international arena has resulted
  in it being subject to substantial international sanctions. Imposing sanctions
  is in itself a non-cooperative approach by the United States and the European
  Union meant to influence the behavior of a country or its political leadership.
  Venezuela’s non-cooperative stance indicates that its political self-determination
  is a priority above that of the humanitarian cost being inflicted on its citizens.

    Political cooperation versus non-cooperation is only one lens through which
geopolitical actors engage with the world, but it is an important one for understand-
ing countries’ priorities. Assessing a state actor’s hierarchy of needs and how it may
change may help us to understand its motivations and priorities. These factors affect
not only countries’ political and military actions but also their willingness to support
economic and financial cooperation, which we will explore next.

QUESTION SET


  1. Which of these is likely lowest on a country’s hierarchy of interests?
      A. Tariff harmonization
      B. Military determination
      C. Cultural program development
     Solution:
     C is correct. Cultural program development is likely lowest on a country’s
     hierarchy of interests. Military determination (B) is often a primary source
     of national security and key to a country’s national interest. Tariff harmoni-
     zation (A) may improve economic activity and improve cooperation. Cultur-
     al programs are important and influential but likely lower priority compared
     with A and B.

  2. Which of the following actions by a country is most likely a form of geopolit-
     ical cooperation?
      A. Acting as a conduit for trade
      B. Engaging in rules standardization

152   Learning Module 5                                                             Introduction to Geopolitics


                                 C. Opting to use soft power over military retaliation
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Political cooperation is associated with anything related to
                                agreements of rules and standardization, with countries working together
                                toward some shared goal. A cooperative country is one that engages and
                                reciprocates in rules standardization. A is incorrect because acting as a
                                conduit of trade, like Panama, involves non-cooperatively using a country’s
                                geographic location as a lever of power in broader international dynamics.
                                C is incorrect because both soft power and military retaliation are examples
                                of non-cooperative behavior, with the former being a less extreme means to
                                influence another country’s decisions without force or coercion.

                             3. Which of the following statements represents an aspect of geopolitical risk?
                                 A. Modeling geopolitical risk is relatively easy to standardize.
                                 B. An engaged country can be considered cooperative, even if it does not
                                    reciprocate.
                                 C. The strength of a country’s institutions is relevant to the durability of
                                    its cooperative relationships.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. The strength of a country’s institutions can make cooperative
                                relationships more durable. A is incorrect because modeling geopolitical
                                risk is not easily standardized. B is incorrect because a cooperative country
                                is one that is both engaged and reciprocates.




              3           FORCES OF GLOBALIZATION

                                        describe geopolitics and its relationship with globalization

                          Globalization is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies,
                          and governments worldwide. It is marked by the spread of products, information,
                          jobs, and culture across borders. Indeed, the spread of goods and services across
                          borders has been increasing for decades. The World Bank Openness Index, a key
                          measure of globalization, has risen from 27 percent in 1970 to more than 60 percent
                          in 2019, as shown in Exhibit 4. Since 2008, globalization has experienced headwinds;
                          these include the impact of the Global Financial Crisis, which increased scrutiny of
                          cross-border activity, and the rise in nationalism, which decreased some countries’
                          appetite for using imported products or services. Capacity constraints may also create
                          an important headwind. Global trade cannot make up 100 percent of global economic
                          activity, meaning its expansion may slow even without specific disruptions.

In addition to its macroeconomic impact, globalization is also visible at a microeco-
nomic level. Take, for example, the production of an automobile. A car may be designed
in Japan, with electrical parts made in Germany, steering systems designed in the
United States, seatbelts manufactured in Sweden, climate system made in Belgium,
and vehicles assembled in Mexico. In fact, automobiles are often assembled in one
country with parts from all over the world, finished in a second country, and sold in
a third (see Exhibit 5). This extensive process provides opportunities for companies
to find the best inputs for their product, whether in terms of quality or cost-effective-
ness. The process of globalization also opens opportunities for investors worldwide,
who may invest in aspects of engineering, production, or even the process of supply
chain management and logistics.

                          Globalization also has cultural and communicative features. Although it can be diffi-
                          cult to measure these features, such as the spread of information or culture, it is not
                          difficult to see them in our daily lives. A grocery store in Warsaw may hold Italian
                          cheese, Moroccan spices, Colombian coffee, and Indian sauces. Social media allows
                          users in South Africa to collaborate on dances with a Japanese music group. Faster
                          and more affordable travel has increased interactions between citizens of countries
                          all over the world. Internet usage allows for the near-instantaneous spread of cultural
                          information and context.


                          Features of Globalization
                          In the previous section, we considered political cooperation and non-cooperation as
                          one lens through which to consider geopolitical actors—primarily national or state
                          actors. Globalization, by contrast, is the result of economic and financial coopera-
                          tion. It is carried out mostly by non-state actors, such as corporations, individuals,
                          or organizations.
                              Globalization is marked by economic and financial cooperation, including the
                          active trade of goods and services, capital flows, currency exchange, and cultural and
                          information exchange. Actors participating in globalization are likely to reach beyond
                          their national borders for access to new markets, talent, or learning. In contrast, anti-
                          globalization or nationalism is the promotion of a country’s own economic interests
                          to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations. Nationalism is marked
                          by limited economic and financial cooperation. These actors may focus on national
                          production and sales, limited cross-border investment and capital flows, and restricted
                          currency exchange. Exhibit 6 shows a continuum from nationalism to globalization.

Globalization and cooperation tend to be correlated, meaning that globalization can
be facilitated or accelerated by political cooperation, but globalization is also an inde-
pendent process. Organic private sector forces can drive the exchange of products or
ideas even without government support or harmonized rules.

                                  economic and financial cooperation. Multinational corporations, for exam-
                                  ple, want a competitive advantage leading them to seek new markets, talent,
                                  and learning as well as trade, capital, currency, and cultural and information
                                  exchange. Corporate outsourcing of talent is an example of globalization.



                          Motivations for Globalization
                          Non-state actors, such as companies and investors, who choose to participate in
                          globalization consider three potential gains:
                              ■    Increasing profits
                              ■    Access to resources and markets
                              ■    Intrinsic gain


                          Increasing Profits
                          Profit can be increased by two means: increasing sales or reducing costs.

                          Increasing sales
                          The opportunity to generate higher profits may motivate companies to globalize.
                          The first way to generate profit is to increase sales. Companies may choose to engage
                          in globalization in order to access new customers for their goods and services. This
                          process may require extensive investment, including acquiring or building property,
                          plant, and equipment in the local market. It may also require hiring workers in new
                          markets and offering training directly benefiting the countries involved.

                          Reducing costs
                          Another way to increase profits is to reduce costs. Globalization allows companies
                          to access lower tax-operating environments, reduce labor costs, or seek other supply
                          chain efficiency gains, all of which are cost-reduction measures. Of course, increasing
                          sales and reducing costs can be closely intertwined. The consolidation of the global
                          automobile industry is one instructive example. For capital-intensive production pro-
                          cesses, companies experience economies of scale, reducing average costs, by producing
                          more. By consolidating, automakers can benefit from a global sales opportunity while
                          reducing costs per auto sold.

                          Access to Resources and Markets
                          In “Motivations for Globalization,” we described the economic interest countries may
                          have to cooperate, including access to resources. The same may be true of non-state
                          actors, such as companies, seeking sustainable access to resources, such as talent or
                          raw materials. If those resources are not readily available or affordable in the home
                          country, then the non-state actor may globalize to improve access.
                              A non-state actor may also seek market access or investment opportunities abroad.
                          For example, a country experiencing low domestic market returns and increasing
                          wealth may experience a higher propensity to accept cross-border risk—a catalyst for
                          seeking returns abroad. For investment professionals, there are two important types
                          of flows. Portfolio investment flows are short-term investments in foreign assets,

Forces of Globalization                                                                    157


such as stocks or bonds. Alternatively, foreign direct investments (FDI) are long-term
investments in the productive capacity of a foreign country. These concepts will be
covered in more detail elsewhere in the curriculum.
    As appetite for cross-border investment has increased, such globalizing actors as
companies and organizations (i.e., industry groups, NGOs, or charitable organizations),
have established processes for facilitating those needs, including foreign exchange,
accounting services, and global investment management services. This globalizing
force, while an independent one, has been facilitated and strengthened over time by
the harmonization of foreign exchange markets and investment practices.

Intrinsic Gain
Intrinsic gain is a side effect or consequence of an activity that generates a bene-
fit beyond profit itself. It is difficult to measure but contributes to globalization’s
momentum. It can also be a stabilizing force, increasing empathy between actors and
reducing the likelihood that a geopolitical threat is levied. One example of intrinsic
gain is the personal growth or education that individuals may receive from expanding
their horizons, experiencing new places, or learning new ideas. Another example is
accelerated productivity from learning new methods.
    Regardless of the motivation for globalization—profit driven or intrinsically
driven—these processes and investments can have multiplicative effects. As global-
ization deepens, companies develop standards and processes to incorporate multiple
cultures into their overall corporate culture. They must cooperate with multiple sets of
rules, and they may establish standard procedures based on the groups of companies
in which they operate.
    While these factors provide important motivating forces for globalization, they
are not the only benefits of globalization. The process of reducing barriers between
global businesses and organization can also provide aggregate economic benefits,
such as increased choice, higher quality goods, increased competition among firms,
higher efficiency, and increased labor mobility.


Costs of Globalization and Threats of Rollback
While globalization provides many benefits, costs also may be associated with it for
individual economies or sectors, depending on how it is implemented. Some of the
potential disadvantages of globalization are discussed in the following sections.

Unequal Accrual of Economic and Financial Gains
Economic theory tells us that aggregate economic activity is improved when all actors
seek profit maximization and efficiency. However, improvement on the aggregate
does not mean improvement for everyone. If a company moves a factory to another
country, it creates jobs in the new country but reduces them at home, while firms in
the new country may have to compete with the foreign firm for labor. Some actors
will benefit from this exchange, but others may suffer.

Lower Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards
Companies operating in lower-cost countries often operate in the local standards of
those countries. If standards on environmental protection, social benefits, or corporate
governance are lower in one country compared with another, and companies ultimately
reduce their standards of production in that context, then globalization can create a
drain on human, administrative, and environmental resources. The more measurable
corporate profit factor may show a gain, but the overall effect of that activity may be
negative. For example, many European countries have stricter standards on carbon
emissions than those elsewhere in the world. Imagine that a European-based company

                          decides to produce in a different country with lighter environmental regulations and
                          cheaper labor costs. If the company decides to act according to local standards rather
                          than its home country standards, it may make more profit but reduce environmental
                          quality.

                          Political Consequences
                          These two costs can create a third cost of globalization: the political consequences of
                          global expansion. While some individuals may enjoy global exposure, others may fear
                          it. While some countries may benefit from improved labor force utilization, others
                          may lose jobs as a company moves abroad. Therefore, globalization can contribute
                          to income and wealth inequality, as well as differences in opportunity, within and
                          between countries. These dynamics can manifest in countries’ local politics, result-
                          ing in a force not only for reduced political and economic cooperation but also for a
                          rollback in political cooperation.

                          Interdependence
                          Through the process of greater economic and financial cooperation, companies may
                          become dependent on other countries’ resources for their supply chains. On aggre-
                          gate, this can result in the nation becoming dependent on other nations for certain
                          resources. If there is a disruption to the supply chain, including through a moment of
                          political non-cooperation, then firms may not be able to produce the good themselves.
                          Commodities production illustrates this potential risk. Rare earth metals, used for
                          light-emitting diode (LED) lights and most electronic displays, are largely produced
                          in China. Copper, essential for renewable energy construction, is largely produced in
                          Chile. Disruptions to production in these countries, including mining accidents or
                          floods, can disrupt entire industries relying on those resources.

                           THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND SUPPLY CHAIN SHORTAGES

                             The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and reached global impact
                             in 2020, provides an interesting example of how geopolitical disruptions can
                             impact companies’ supply chains and countries’ access to important resources.
                             In the early months of 2020, many countries enforced stay-at-home orders in
                             hopes of protecting their citizens against the pandemic’s spread. As a result,
                             demand for many goods and services collapsed and manufacturing activity was
                             restricted, resulting in a significant slowdown in production of many goods and
                             services. Even as production resumed, the impact of production slowdown had
                             ripple effects across industries.
                                 Semiconductors were one such product. Semiconductor production is highly
                             concentrated in China and is very important to the automobile industry. The
                             chips are used for fuel-pressure sensors, navigation displays, and speedometers,
                             among other automotive devices. Gradually, as the pandemic wore on, mobility
                             began to improve, but supply remained constrained. The result was a severe
                             shortage of semiconductor supply, which contributed to high and rising prices
                             for new, used, and rental automobiles in many countries across the world. This
                             dependence of a global industry on one country’s production illustrates how
                             interconnected supply chains can create important financial risks. Additionally,
                             the effects of the semiconductor shortage soon moved beyond the automobile
                             industry, as other industrial players struggled to secure chips for their devices.

       The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic built upon preexisting challenges
   to global supply chain management. Supply disruptions revealed the pitfalls of
   overreliance on any single production location. Corporates found their supply
   chains were fragile as inputs sourced from foreign countries became unavailable
   or manufacturing moved offshore suddenly fell victim to lockdown orders.



Threats of Rollback of Globalization
The threat of deglobalization has grabbed headlines since 2018 when the Trump admin-
istration began a series of “America first” policies. Rooted in nationalism, isolationism,
and concerns for national and economic security, trade wars escalated in fits and starts
for several years. Targets evolved to include not only countries traditionally seen as US
competitors but also long-standing allies, such as the European Union, through tariffs
on imported products, and Canada and Mexico, through a renegotiation of the North
America Free Trade Agreement now known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(USMCA). These developments have led investors and policy makers to consider
whether globalization is reversing and what it means for the path of geopolitical risk.
    Indeed, the impact of political non-cooperation on multinational companies is
significant. Global design, manufacturing, and distribution systems are complex,
making a change in the rules—such as a restriction on the free movement of goods
and services—burdensome, which raises questions about profitability and efficiency.
Multinational corporations are accustomed, however, to the political and operational
risks of international production. This makes management rightfully slow to change
carefully engineered processes over political disputes that eventually may be cleared up.
    Despite the deglobalization discussion, completely reversing globalization seems
unlikely. Instead, companies are likely to use a combination of the following tactics
to fortify their supply chains:
   1. Reshoring the essentials: Shortages of prescription medication, personal
      protective equipment, and other essential items during the pandemic high-
      lighted the need for certain “essential” supply chains to be rebuilt domesti-
      cally for emergency situations. Companies seeking to reduce manufacturing
      and procurement risk may relocate back to their home countries.
   2. Reglobalizing production: The same concerns about production disruptions,
      rising labor costs, or political risk may instead prompt companies to dupli-
      cate or fortify their supply chains.
   3. Doubling down on key markets: China has been the focus of US trade con-
      cerns, but the political risk is unlikely to change the need for some global-
      ization. Not all manufacturing would be able to move outside of such key
      markets as China, Canada, and Mexico, particularly for companies that also
      seek to sell to those markets. While labor costs in some trading partners

                             1. Which of these actions would do the most to increase geopolitical
                                risk?
                                 A. Increase capital flows
                                 B. Restrict foreign currency exchange
                                 C. Engage in trade of goods and services
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Restricted foreign currency exchange—a characteristic of anti-
                                globalization—would likely reduce political and economic cooperation and
                                thus increase geopolitical risk. A is incorrect because an increase in capital
                                flows would reduce geopolitical risk. C is incorrect because an increase in
                                trade would reduce geopolitical risk.




              4           INTERNATIONAL TRADE ORGANIZATIONS

                                        describe functions and objectives of the international organizations
                                        that facilitate trade, including the World Bank, the International
                                        Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization

                          During the Great Depression in the 1930s, countries attempted to support their failing
                          economies by sharply raising barriers to foreign trade, devaluing their currencies to
                          compete against each other for export markets, and restricting their citizens’ freedom
                          to hold foreign exchange. These attempts proved to be self-defeating. World trade
                          declined dramatically and employment and living standards fell sharply in many
                          countries. By the 1940s, it had become a widespread conviction that the world econ-
                          omy needed organizations to help promote international economic cooperation. In
                          July 1944, during the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton
                          Woods, New Hampshire, representatives of 45 governments agreed on a framework for
                          international economic cooperation. Two crucial, multinational organizations emanated
                          from this conference—the World Bank, which was founded during the conference,
                          and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which came into formal existence in
                          December 1945. Although the IMF was founded with the goal to stabilize exchange
                          rates and assist the reconstruction of the world’s international payment system, the
                          World Bank was created to facilitate post-war reconstruction and development.
                              A third institution, the International Trade Organization (ITO), was to be created
                          to handle the trade side of international economic cooperation, joining the other two
                          Bretton Woods institutions. The draft ITO charter was ambitious, extending beyond
                          world trade regulations to include rules on employment, commodity agreements,
                          restrictive business practices, international investment, and services. The objective
                          was to create the ITO at a United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment in
                          Havana, Cuba in 1947. Meanwhile, 15 countries had begun negotiations in December
                          1945 to reduce and regulate customs tariffs. With World War II only barely ended,
                          they wanted to give an early boost to trade liberalization and begin to correct the
                          legacy of protectionist measures that had remained in place since the early 1930s.
                          The group had expanded to 23 nations by the time the deal was signed on 30 October

1947 and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was born. The Havana
conference began on 21 November 1947, less than a month after GATT was signed.
The ITO charter was finally approved in Havana in March 1948, but ratification in
some national legislatures proved impossible. The most serious opposition was in the
US Congress, even though the US government had been one of the driving forces. In
1950, the US government announced that it would not seek congressional ratifica-
tion of the Havana Charter, and the ITO was effectively dead. As a consequence, the
GATT became the only multilateral instrument governing international trade from
1948 until the World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially established in 1995.


Role of the International Monetary Fund
As we saw earlier, current account deficits reflect a shortage of net savings in an
economy and can be addressed by policies designed to rein in domestic demand. This
approach, however, could have adverse consequences for domestic employment. The
IMF stands ready to lend foreign currencies to member countries to assist them during
periods of significant external deficits. A pool of gold and currencies contributed by
members provides the IMF with the resources required for these lending operations.
The funds are lent only under strict conditions and borrowing countries’ macro-
economic policies are continually monitored. The IMF’s main mandate is to ensure
the stability of the international monetary system, the system of exchange rates and
international payments that enables countries to buy goods and services from each
other. More specifically, the IMF:
   ■   provides a forum for cooperation on international monetary problems;
   ■   facilitates the growth of international trade and promotes employment,
       economic growth, and poverty reduction;
   ■   supports exchange rate stability and an open system of international pay-
       ments; and
   ■   lends foreign exchange to members when needed, on a temporary basis
       and under adequate safeguards, to help them address balance of payments
       problems.
    The 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis demonstrated that domestic and inter-
national financial stability cannot be taken for granted, even in the world’s most
developed countries. In light of these events, the IMF has redefined and deepened
its operations by:
   ■   enhancing its lending facilities: The IMF has upgraded its lending facilities
       to better serve its members. As part of a wide-ranging reform of its lend-
       ing practices, it also has redefined the way it engages with countries on
       issues related to structural reform of their economies. In this context, it has
       doubled member countries’ access to fund resources and streamlined its
       lending approach to reduce the stigma of borrowing for countries in need of
       financial help.
   ■   improving the monitoring of global, regional, and country economies: The
       IMF has taken several steps to improve economic and financial surveillance,
       which is its framework for providing advice to member countries on macro-
       economic policies and warning member countries of risks and vulnerabili-
       ties in their economies.
   ■   helping resolve global economic imbalances: The IMF’s analysis of global eco-
       nomic developments provides finance ministers and central bank governors
       with a common framework for discussing the global economy.

                              ■   analyzing capital market developments: The IMF is devoting more resources
                                  to the analysis of global financial markets and their links with macroeco-
                                  nomic policy. It also offers training to country officials on how to man-
                                  age their financial systems, monetary and exchange regimes, and capital
                                  markets.
                              ■   assessing financial sector vulnerabilities: Resilient, well-regulated financial
                                  systems are essential for macroeconomic stability in a world of ever-growing
                                  capital flows. The IMF and the World Bank jointly run an assessment pro-
                                  gram aimed at alerting countries to vulnerabilities and risks in their finan-
                                  cial sectors.
                              From an investment perspective, the IMF helps to keep country-specific market
                          risk and global systemic risk under control. The Greek sovereign debt crisis, which
                          threatened to destabilize the entire European banking system, is an example. In early
                          2010, the Greek sovereign debt rating was downgraded to non-investment grade by
                          leading rating agencies as a result of serious concerns about the sustainability of Greece’s
                          public sector debt load. Yields on Greek government bonds rose substantially following
                          the downgrading and the country’s ability to refinance its national debt was seriously
                          questioned in international capital markets. Bonds issued by some other European
                          governments fell and equity markets worldwide declined in response to spreading
                          concerns of a Greek debt default. The downgrading of Greek sovereign debt was the
                          ultimate consequence of persistent and growing budget deficits the Greek government
                          had run before and after the country had joined the European Monetary Union (EMU)
                          in 2001. Most of the budget shortfalls reflected elevated outlays for public-sector jobs,
                          pensions, and other social benefits as well as persistent tax evasion. Reports that
                          the Greek government had consistently and deliberately misreported the country’s
                          official economic and budget statistics contributed to further erosion of confidence
                          in Greek government bonds in international financial markets. Facing default, the
                          Greek government requested that a joint European Union/IMF bailout package be
                          activated, and a loan agreement was reached between Greece, the other EMU member
                          countries, and the IMF. The deal consisted of an immediate EUR45 billion in loans to
                          be provided in 2010, with more funds available later. A total of EUR110 billion was
                          agreed depending on strict economic policy conditions that included cuts in wages
                          and benefits, an increase in the retirement age for public-sector employees, limits on
                          public pensions, increases in direct and indirect taxes, and a substantial reduction in
                          state-owned companies. By providing conditional emergency lending facilities to the
                          Greek government and designing a joint program with the European Union on how
                          to achieve fiscal consolidation, the IMF prevented a contagious wave of sovereign
                          debt crises in global capital markets.
                              Another example of IMF activities is the East Asian Financial Crisis in the late
                          1990s. It began in July 1997, when Thailand was forced to abandon its currency’s peg
                          with the US dollar. Currency devaluation subsequently hit other East Asian countries
                          that had similar balance of payment problems, including South Korea, Malaysia, the
                          Philippines, and Indonesia. They had run persistent and increasing current account
                          deficits, financed mainly with short-term capital imports, in particular, domestic
                          banks borrowing in international financial markets. External financing was popular
                          because of the combination of lower foreign (especially US) interest rates and fixed
                          exchange rates. Easy money obtained from abroad led to imprudent investment,
                          which contributed to overcapacities in several industries and inflated prices on real
                          estate and stock markets. The IMF came to the rescue of the affected countries with
                          considerable loans, accompanied by policies designed to control domestic demand,
                          which included fiscal austerity and tightened monetary reins.

World Bank Group and Developing Countries
The World Bank’s main objective is to help developing countries fight poverty and
enhance environmentally sound economic growth. For developing countries to grow
and attract business, they have to
    ■   strengthen their governments and educate their government officials;
    ■   implement legal and judicial systems that encourage business;
    ■   protect individual and property rights and honor contracts;
    ■   develop financial systems robust enough to support endeavors ranging from
        micro credit to financing larger corporate ventures; and
    ■   combat corruption.
    Given these targets, the World Bank provides funds for a wide range of projects
in developing countries worldwide and financial and technical expertise aimed at
helping those countries reduce poverty.
    The World Bank’s two closely affiliated entities—the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development
Association (IDA)—provide low or no-interest loans and grants to countries that
have unfavorable or no access to international credit markets. Unlike private finan-
cial institutions, neither the IBRD nor the IDA operates for profit. The IBRD is
market-based, and uses its high credit rating to pass the low interest it pays for funds
on to its borrowers—developing countries. It pays for its own operating costs because
it does not look to outside sources to furnish funds for overhead.
    IBRD lending to developing countries is primarily financed by selling AAA-rated
bonds in the world’s financial markets. Although the IBRD earns a small margin on this
lending, the greater proportion of its income comes from lending out its own capital.
This capital consists of reserves built up over the years and money paid in from the
Bank’s 185 member country shareholders. IBRD’s income also pays for World Bank
operating expenses and has contributed to IDA and debt relief. IDA is the world’s
largest source of interest-free loans and grant assistance to the poorest countries.
IDA’s funds are replenished every three years by 40 donor countries. Additional funds
are regenerated through repayments of loan principal on 35- to 40-year, no-interest
loans, which are then available for relending. At the end of September 2010, the IBRD
had net loans outstanding of USD125.5 billion, while its borrowings amounted to
USD132 billion.
    In addition to acting as a financier, the World Bank also provides analysis, advice,
and information to its member countries to enable them to achieve the lasting economic
and social improvements their people need. Another core function of the World Bank
is to increase the capabilities of its partners, people in developing countries, and its
own staff. Links to a wide range of knowledge-sharing networks have been set up by
the Bank to address the vast need for information and dialogue about development.
    From an investment perspective, the World Bank helps to create the basic economic
infrastructure that is essential for the creation of domestic financial markets and a
well-functioning financial industry in developing countries. Moreover, the IBRD is one
of the most important supranational borrowers in the international capital markets.
Because of its strong capital position and its very conservative financial, liquidity, and
lending policies, it enjoys the top investment-grade rating from the leading agencies,
and investors have confidence in its ability to withstand adverse events. As a result,
IBRD bonds denominated in various major currencies are widely held by institutional
and private investors.

                          World Trade Organization and Global Trade
                          The WTO provides the legal and institutional foundation of the multinational trad-
                          ing system. It is the only international organization that regulates cross-border trade
                          relationships among nations on a global scale. It was founded on 1 January 1995,
                          replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that had come into
                          existence in 1947. The GATT was the only multilateral body governing international
                          trade from 1947 to 1995. It operated for almost half a century as a quasi-institution-
                          alized, provisional system of multilateral treaties. Several rounds of negotiations took
                          place under the GATT, of which the Tokyo round and the Uruguay round may have
                          been the most far reaching. The Tokyo round was the first major effort to address a
                          wide range of non-tariff trade barriers, whereas the Uruguay round focused on the
                          extension of the world trading system into several new areas, particularly trade in
                          services and intellectual property, but also to reform trade in agricultural products
                          and textiles. The GATT still exists in an updated 1994 version and is the WTO’s
                          principal treaty for trade in goods. The GATT and the General Agreement on Trade
                          in Services (GATS) are the major agreements within the WTO’s body of treaties that
                          encompasses a total of about 60 agreements, annexes, decisions, and understandings.
                              In November 2001, the most recent round of negotiations was launched by the
                          WTO in Doha, Qatar. The Doha round was an ambitious effort to enhance global-
                          ization by slashing barriers and subsidies in agriculture and addressing a wide range
                          of cross-border services. So far, under GATS, which came into force in January 1995,
                          banks, insurance companies, telecommunication firms, tour operators, hotel chains,
                          and transport companies that want to do business abroad can enjoy the same principles
                          of free and fair trade that previously had applied only to international trade in goods.
                          Although no final agreement was reached in the Doha round, it marked one of the
                          most crucial events in global trade over the past several decades: China’s accession
                          to the WTO in December 2001. The inability to reach agreement in the Doha round
                          led to an increasing number of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, such as
                          the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Japan, Vietnam, and nine other countries.
                              The WTO’s most important functions are the implementation, administration, and
                          operation of individual agreements; acting as a platform for negotiations; and settling
                          disputes. Moreover, the WTO has the mandate to review and propagate its members’
                          trade policies and ensure the coherence and transparency of trade policies through
                          surveillance in a global policy setting. The WTO also provides technical cooperation
                          and training to developing, least-developed, and low-income countries to assist with
                          their adjustment to WTO rules. In addition, the WTO is a major source of economic
                          research and analysis, producing ongoing assessments of global trade in its publications
                          and research reports on special topics. Finally, the WTO works in cooperation with
                          the other two Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank.
                              From an investment perspective, the WTO’s framework of global trade rules
                          provides the major institutional and regulatory base without which today’s global
                          multinational corporations would be hard to conceive. Modern financial markets
                          would look different without the large, multinational companies whose stocks and
                          bonds have become key elements in investment portfolios. In the equity universe, for
                          instance, investment considerations focusing on global sectors rather than national
                          markets would make little sense without a critical mass of multinational firms com-
                          peting with each other in a globally defined business environment.

  Request for Stand-By Arrangement
     This paper was prepared based on the information available at the time it
  was completed on Monday, May 10, 2010. The views expressed in this docu-
  ment are those of the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the
  government of Greece or the Executive Board of the IMF. The policy of publi-
  cation of staff reports and other documents by the IMF allows for the deletion
  of market-sensitive information.
     May 3, 2010
     Managing Director
     International Monetary Fund
     Washington DC
     The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
  outlines the economic and financial policies that the Greek government and the
  Bank of Greece, respectively, will implement during the remainder of 2010 and
  in the period 2011–2013 to strengthen market confidence and Greece’s fiscal
  and financial position during a difficult transition period toward a more open
  and competitive economy. The government is fully committed to the policies
  stipulated in this document and its attachments, to frame tight budgets in the
  coming years with the aim to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent in 2014
  and achieve a downward trajectory in the public debt-GDP ratio beginning in
  2013, to safeguard the stability of the Greek financial system, and to implement
  structural reforms to boost competitiveness and the economy’s capacity to
  produce, save, and export. (…) The government is strongly determined to lower
  the fiscal deficit, (…) by achieving higher and more equitable tax collections,
  and constraining spending in the government wage bill and entitlement out-
  lays, among other items. In view of these efforts and to signal the commitment
  to effective macroeconomic policies, the Greek government requests that the
  Fund supports this multi-year program under a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
  for a period of 36 months in an amount equivalent to SDR26.4 billion. (A SDR
  (special drawing right) is a basket of four leading currencies: Japanese yen (JPY),
  US dollar (USD), British pound (GBP), and euro (EUR).) A parallel request for
  financial assistance to euro area countries for a total amount of EUR80 billion
  has been sent. The implementation of the program will be monitored through
  quantitative performance criteria and structural benchmarks as described in the
  attached MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). There
  will be twelve quarterly reviews of the program supported under the SBA by
  the Fund, (….) to begin with the first review that is expected to be completed
  in the course of the third calendar quarter of 2010, and then every quarter
  thereafter until the last quarterly review envisaged to be completed during the
  second calendar quarter of 2013, to assess progress in implementing the program
  and reach understandings on any additional measures that may be needed to
  achieve its objectives. (….) The Greek authorities believe that the policies set
  forth in the attached memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of
  the economic program, and stand ready to take any further measures that may
  become appropriate for this purpose. The authorities will consult with the Fund
  in accordance with its policies on such consultations, (….) and in advance of
  revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP. All information requested by
  the Fund (….) to assess implementation of the program will be provided.
     (….)
     Sincerely,
                                           ​

                             1. What is the objective of the IMF’s emergency lending facilities?
                                Solution:
                                The program seeks to safeguard the stability of the Greek financial system
                                and to implement structural reforms to boost competitiveness and the econ-
                                omy’s capacity to produce, save, and export.

                             2. What are the macroeconomic policy conditions under which the IMF pro-
                                vides emergency lending to Greece?
                                Solution:
                                The Greek government has to reduce the country’s fiscal deficit by achieving
                                higher and more equitable tax collections as well as constrain spending in
                                the government wage bill and entitlement outlays.

                             3. What is the amount Greece requests from the IMF as emergency funds?
                                Solution:
                                Greece applied for a standby arrangement in an amount equivalent to
                                SDR26.4 billion (approximately USD39.5 billion, based on the 10 May 2010
                                exchange rate).

                             4. Which of the following international trade organizations regulates
                                cross-border exchange among nations on a global scale?
                                 A. World Bank Group (World Bank)
                                 B. World Trade Organization (WTO)
                                 C. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. The WTO provides the legal and institutional foundation of
                                the multinational trading system and is the only international organization
                                that regulates cross-border trade relations among nations on a global scale.
                                The WTO’s mission is to foster free trade by providing a major institutional
                                and regulatory framework of global trade rules. Without such global trading
                                rules, today’s global transnational corporations would be hard to conceive.

                             5. Which of the following international trade organizations has a mission to
                                help developing countries fight poverty and enhance environmentally sound
                                economic growth?
                                 A. World Bank Group (World Bank)
                                 B. World Trade Organization (WTO)
                                 C. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The World Bank’s mission is to help developing countries fight
                                poverty and enhance environmentally sound economic growth. The World
                                Bank helps to create the basic economic infrastructure essential for creation
                                and maintenance of domestic financial markets and a well-functioning
                                financial industry in developing countries.

                             6. Which of the following organizations helps to keep global systemic risk
                                under control by preventing contagion in scenarios such as the 2010 Greek
                                sovereign debt crisis?

      B. World Trade Organization (WTO)
      C. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
     Solution:
     C is correct. From an investment perspective, the IMF helps to keep coun-
     try-specific market risk and global systemic risk under control. The Greek
     sovereign debt crisis in 2010, which threatened to destabilize the entire
     European banking system, is a recent example. The IMF’s mission is to en-
     sure the stability of the international monetary system—that is, the system
     of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries to buy
     goods and services from each other.

  7. Which of the following international trade bodies was the only multilateral
     body governing international trade from 1948 to 1995?
      A. World Trade Organization (WTO)
      B. International Trade Organization (ITO)
      C. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
     Solution:
     C is correct. The GATT was the only multilateral body governing inter-
     national trade from 1948 to 1995. It operated for almost half a century as
     a quasi-institutionalized, provisional system of multilateral treaties and
     included several rounds of negotiations.




ASSESSING GEOPOLITICAL ACTORS AND RISK
                                                                                           5
              describe geopolitical risk

Using the two axes we have discussed—political cooperation versus non-cooperation
and globalization versus nationalism—investment analysts can assess geopolitical
actors and the likelihood of threat to investment outcomes. Where countries stand in
that balance shapes their standing compared with other geopolitical actors, the tools
of geopolitics they can use, and the threats and opportunities they face. This lesson
provides a framework for analyzing a country’s geopolitical risk.


Archetypes of Country Behavior
The framework, using the two axes, shown in Exhibit 7 presents four archetypes of
country behavior: autarky, hegemony, multilateralism, and bilateralism. Each
archetype has its own costs, benefits, and trade-offs with respect to geopolitical
risk. In general terms, regions, countries, and industries that are more dependent on
cross-border goods and capital flows will have growth rates and investment returns that
benefit from greater global cooperation. The interdependent nature of their activities
may reduce the likelihood that collaborative countries levy economic, financial, or
political attacks on one another. That same interdependence often makes cooperative
actors more vulnerable to geopolitical risk than those less dependent on cooperation
and trade. Diversifying the means of production provides some shield against risk but
also provides more touchpoints by which risk can occur. In the remainder of the section,
we describe the costs and benefits of each archetype, with some examples of each.

                               Non-Cooperation                                                          Cooperation



                                                  Autarky                              Bilateralism



                                                                   Nationalism/
                                                                 Anti-Globalization




                          Note that each of the axes explored in this framework—cooperation versus
                          non-cooperation and globalization versus nationalism—represent a spectrum. Rarely
                          do countries represent full extremes of either of these factors. As you can see from the
                          examples provided, a country’s place within the framework can be a moving target.
                          As such, the examples provided in no way represent a value judgment of a country’s
                          goals or approach.
                              For geopolitical risk analysis, it matters not only which quadrant a country falls
                          in today but also its stability within that quadrant. A hegemon that is working to
                          build more political cooperation may be less of a threat to investment results than a
                          multilateral actor trying to break them.
                              The “America first” example given in the section “Threats of Rollback of
                          Globalization” is highly relevant. Adjusting previously agreed-upon rules may be in
                          a country’s national interest, but inconsistent application of those rules presents a risk
                          for companies and economic growth. Investors must be aware of actors’ movement
                          within the framework to assess the likelihood and impact of geopolitical risk more
                          appropriately.

                             Geopolitical Risk Analysis

                             1. True or false: The relative permanence of geographic factors implies a fun-
                                damental stability in geopolitical risk analysis of the involved parties.

                                Explain your selection.
                                 A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Geopolitical risk analysis is fundamentally dynamic, with
                                analysts needing to be aware of the parties’ movement within the relevant
                                framework to assess the likelihood and impact of geopolitical risk.
                                Geopolitical actors face a delicate balance between harnessing the potential
                                intrinsic and profit gains from globalization while managing the many and

      sometimes unforeseen consequences. Further complicating the picture is
      the intricate connection between globalization and cooperation. A country’s
      place within the globalization and cooperation framework can be a moving
      target, and for geopolitical risk analysis, it matters not only which quadrant
      a company falls in today but also its stability within that quadrant.


Autarky
Autarky describes countries seeking political self-sufficiency with little or no external
trade or finance. State-owned enterprises control strategic domestic industries. The
self-sufficiency of autarkic countries allows them to be stronger politically, including
the ability to exercise complete control over the supply of technology, goods, and ser-
vices, as well as media and political messaging. In some cases, periods of autarky can
provide a country with swifter economic and political development. For example, for
much of the 20th century, China could have been described as autarkic, exercising very
little political cooperation or globalization. However, China’s autarkic stance resulted
in substantial poverty alleviation and an eventual move toward more economic and
financial cooperation. That said, an autarkic stance does not come without costs. In
other cases, such as North Korea and the earlier example of Venezuela, autarky has
resulted in a gradual loss of economic and political development within the country.

Hegemony
Hegemonic countries tend to be regional or even global leaders, and they use their
political or economic influence of others to control resources. State-owned enterprises
tend to control key export markets. A hegemonic system can provide valuable benefits
both to the hegemonic countries and to the international system. For the country,
economic and political dominance may provide important influence on global affairs.
For the global system, countries aligning with the hegemon’s rules and standards may
enjoy the rewards provided by the leader, including the stabilizing force of monitoring
and enforcing the hegemon’s standards. That said, there may be costs to hegemonic
systems. As hegemons gain or lose influence in the international system, they may
become more competitive, increasing the likelihood of geopolitical risk.

CHINA AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

   In 2011, China overtook Japan as the world’s second largest economy. Having
   joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China’s economy had
   globalized meaningfully. At the same time, the importance of China’s economy
   gave it important influence on the rules of play in the international stage. One
   area where China has exerted its political influence is in technology transfer.
   For many years, China’s stance was, in order to integrate into the Chinese pro-
   duction machine, including access to a skilled and plentiful labor supply, some
   companies would be required to transfer their technology ideas and processes
   to Chinese partners. For a smaller or less important economy, these rules might
   be difficult to enforce, but China’s size and importance made it possible. These
   policies may have some globalizing effects. By having Chinese companies adopt
   more international technological ideas and rules, they become more globalized
   in their approach. At the same time, they can also create investment risks. If
   China were to become more restrictive, it could disrupt global supply chains
   and increase costs for global companies.

                           RUSSIA AND GAS DISPUTES

                             Russia’s economy, and particularly its oil sector, is well-integrated into global
                             supply chains. However, the country is also largely politically autonomous, which
                             can contribute to geopolitical risk and uncertainty. For example, Russia’s control
                             of important natural gas pipelines gives it significant political leverage over other
                             countries, particularly those in Europe that rely on it for fossil fuels. As a result,
                             European countries may be less likely to confront Russia in other areas. Between
                             February and March 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, Ukraine. Other countries
                             condemned the annexation and considered it to be a violation of international

                             Belavezha Accords that established the Commonwealth of Independent States.
                             Still, the annexation continues, in part because many countries are unwilling to
                             disrupt an important economic relationship.
                                 In addition to political uncertainty, the annexation contributed to import-
                             ant economic and market developments affecting investors. In the immediate
                             aftermath of the annexation, the Russian ruble depreciated significantly, con-
                             tributing to higher market volatility and inflation. Other significant economic
                             impacts followed. For example, countries, including Canada, the United States,
                             and European Union member states, imposed sanctions on Russian officials.
                             Ukraine responded to the annexation by cutting off water to the area, contrib-
                             uting to crop failure.


                          Multilateralism
                          Multilateralism describes countries that participate in mutually beneficial trade rela-
                          tionships and extensive rules harmonization. Private firms are fully integrated into
                          global supply chains with multiple trade partners. Examples of multilateral countries
                          include Germany and Singapore.

                           SINGAPORE AS MULTILATERAL ACTOR

                             Singapore is ranked as the most open economy in the world by the World
                             Economic Forum, the third least corrupt by Transparency International, and the
                             second most pro-business by the World Bank Doing Business Report. It has low
                             tax rates and the second highest per capita GDP in terms of purchasing power
                             of its citizens. The results are shown In Exhibit 8.

     What is behind these impressive statistics? For starters, Singapore’s factor endow-
ment makes it highly dependent on cooperation and innovation to survive. The
country has limited natural resources, including water and arable land, which means
the country must rely on agrotechnology parks and reclaimed land for agricultural
production as well as trade partners for the inputs to that production.
     Geographic factors also contribute to Singapore’s economic openness. The country
is located at the intersection of many important global trade routes. Its population is
highly ethnically and racially diverse, allowing for English as a key language for global
business. In addition, its workforce is highly skilled, giving Singapore an important
role as a center for trade and innovation throughout Asia.
     Politically, Singapore has highly stable institutions. The government is strategically
involved in its economic system to allow for consistent prioritization of economic
activity and enforcement of business-friendly institutional governance. Singapore’s
openness has contributed to its attractiveness as a potential partner.
     As a result of its location and factor endowments, Singapore is both capable of and
highly dependent on international cooperation for its economic growth. The country
generates higher economic growth rates because of this greater global cooperation.
However, that same cooperation may leave Singapore more vulnerable to geopolitical
risk than those countries that are less dependent on cooperation and trade.

   Key Globalization Factors

   1. Identify at least two of the factors accounting for Singapore’s reliance on
      globalization to achieve economic success.
      Solution:
      First, Singapore’s factor endowment of limited natural resources makes it
      dependent on cooperation and innovation to survive.
      Second, Singapore’s geographic location at the intersection of multiple im-
      portant global trade routes helps make it an Asian center for world business.
      Third, culturally it has a highly ethnically and racially diverse population
      fluent in the key global business language of English, enhancing its collabo-
      rative capabilities.
      Finally, it has highly stable political institutions with high governmental
      priorities on promoting economic activity and enforcing business-friendly

                                institutional governance. These qualities make it an attractive potential busi-
                                ness partner and likely sought out for global cooperation.


                          Bilateralism
                          Bilateralism is the conduct of political, economic, financial, or cultural cooperation
                          between two countries. Countries engaging in bilateralism may have relations with
                          many different countries, but they are one-at-a-time agreements without multiple
                          partners. Typically, countries exist on a spectrum between bilateralism and multilat-
                          eralism. In between the two extremes is regionalism, in which a group of countries
                          cooperate with one another. Both bilateralism and regionalism can be conducted at
                          the exclusion of other groups. For example, regional blocs may agree to provide trade
                          benefits to one another and increase barriers for those outside of that group.
                              It is noteworthy that relatively few countries perfectly fit the bilateral mold. Moving
                          toward stronger political cooperation tends to lead organically to globalization; it
                          is common for non-state actors to globalize as long as the path is laid for them.
                          Additionally, innovations, such as the internet and digital transfer, have made it even
                          easier for firms to globalize.
                              Bilateralism once nicely described Japan; its government engaged in substantial
                          political cooperation for the sake of building a strong export market, but it did not
                          globalize its imports. That said, as the importance of international capital markets
                          has deepened, Japan has been a pioneer of globalizing its equity and bond markets
                          for international players. Today it would be considered a multilateral player.

                           QUESTION SET


                             1. For the following contrasting pairs of archetypes of globalization
                                and cooperation, which one reflects the greatest differences in country
                                behavior?
                                 A. Bilateralism versus autarky
                                 B. Multilateralism versus autarky
                                 C. Multilateralism versus hegemony
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Multilateralism describes countries that participate in mutually
                                beneficial trade relationships and extensive rules harmonization. Autarky
                                describes countries seeking political self-sufficiency with little or no external
                                trade or finance. In the Exhibit 7 display of these behavior patterns, these
                                choices are most widely separated on both the globalization and cooper-
                                ation continuums. A is incorrect because bilateral or regional approaches
                                describe those countries leveraging regional trade relationships and may
                                face the world as a group. Bilateralism shares with autarky a bias against glo-
                                balization. These approaches diverge, however, regarding cooperation, with
                                autarky being more non-cooperative. C is incorrect because multilateralism
                                describes countries that participate in mutually beneficial trade relation-
                                ships and extensive rules harmonization. Hegemony represents countries
                                exerting political or economic influence of others to control resources.
                                Multilateralism shares with hegemony an inclination toward globalization,
                                as shown in Exhibit 7, but diverges from hegemony regarding cooperation;
                                hegemony is more non-cooperative.

THE TOOLS OF GEOPOLITICS
                                                                                            6
              describe tools of geopolitics and their impact on regions and
              economies

Now that we understand the characteristics of geopolitical actors, we can examine
the tools these actors use to manifest or reinforce their interests with respect to oth-
ers. The tools an actor uses are ultimately the source of geopolitical risk as it affects
investors—shaping the likelihood of risk as well as the speed and size of impact, as
we will explore in Lesson 6. As a result, understanding these tools may be just as
important as understanding the motivations for using them.


The Tools of Geopolitics
The tools of geopolitics may be separated into three types:
   ■   national security tools,
   ■   economic tools, and
   ■   financial tools.
    Among each of these tools, there are choices that reflect or improve cooperation
and those that reflect or escalate conflict (non-cooperation). Tools facilitating coop-
eration are those that increase flows between countries; this can mean an increased
flow of goods, services, capital, or labor through treaties, trade agreements, capital
provisions, and approved migration. Tools escalating conflict are those that reduce
these flows between countries.
    We can use the framework provided in the section “Archetypes of Country
Behavior” in Lesson 4 to assess the nature of tools used by geopolitical actors and to
strengthen our designation of countries within that framework. The extent to which
actors use these tools to improve cooperation or escalate conflict influences their
position within the framework. As we described earlier, it is important for geopoliti-
cal risk analysts to track not only which quadrant best describes an actor but also its
stability within that quadrant. Using different national security, economic, or financial
tools may indicate that an actor is changing in character, which would increase or
decrease geopolitical risk. Exhibit 9 shows how the tools of geopolitics fit in the four
archetypes of country behavior (presented in Exhibit 7).

                          National security tools are those used to influence or coerce a state actor through direct
                          or indirect impact on the country’s resources, people, or borders. National security
                          tools may be active, meaning they are being used at the time of analysis, or threatened,
                          meaning they are not currently used but their use is likely enough to warrant concern.
                               The most extreme example of a national security tool is that of armed conflict.
                          Armed conflict is a direct and active national security tool. It can be internal or exter-
                          nal to a country and has two major impacts. The first is the disruption or destruction
                          of physical infrastructure, which can inflict long-term damage on a country’s capital
                          stock and ability to rebuild that stock. The second impact is on migration away from
                          areas of armed conflict, which can reshape international flows of goods, services, cap-
                          ital, and labor. It also can affect neighboring countries and states accepting refugees.

                           SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS (SINCE 2011) AND IMPACTS ON GERMANY

                             The Syrian refugee crisis began in March 2011 after a violent government crack-
                             down on public demonstrations. Protests turned into an armed rebellion and
                             escalated to civil war. As a result, Syria has experienced extreme deterioration
                             of its physical infrastructure, including buildings transportation, and other
                             structures. As conflict prolonged, more than 6.6 million Syrians have fled the
                             country, with another 6.7 million having been internally displaced. Beyond the
                             tragic human toll of this ongoing conflict, Syria has also experienced negative
                             impact on its current and potential economic growth as a result of the deteri-
                             oration of its capital and labor stock. According to the International Monetary
                             Fund (IMF), Syria’s economy grew by 4.5 percent, on average, from 2000 to
                             2010. By 2016, the Syrian economy was less than half its size before the war. In
                             investment terms, these developments have contributed to a sustained higher
                             discount rate and lower bond and equity returns.
                                 The majority of refugees have found refuge in neighboring countries, such
                             as Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. However, many also made their way, often by
                             dangerous routes, to European countries. The refugee crisis attracted signifi-
                             cant international attention in 2015 when German Chancellor Angela Merkel

   announced that the country would admit 1 million Syrian refugees. In the
   short-term, the decision was disruptive to domestic politics and international
   cooperation as not all citizens and neighboring countries were supportive of
   the approach. The decision also carried economic costs, including constructing
   housing and establishing resettlement programs. However, in the long-term,
   Germany appears to be benefiting from the cooperative decision, having attracted
   a younger and skilled demographic of migrants thus improving the demographic
   balance of an otherwise-aging country. The resulting improvements in Germany’s
   labor and capital stock may improve Germany’s potential economic growth rate.
   In investment terms, a higher potential economic growth rate contributes to
   higher expected market returns, all else equal, and may contribute to industry
   developments or innovations.

    Of course, not all tools are used in so direct a nature as armed conflict. For example,
espionage, or the practice of using spies to obtain political or military information, is
a necessarily indirect national security tool. Military alliances often are used to aid in
direct conflict and also to deter conflict from arising in the first place.
    Additionally, not all national security tools are used in a non-cooperative way.
State actors can combine forces to reduce the likelihood that national security tools
are used. For example, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance
between the European Union, United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, is used
to discuss and deescalate potential conflict among members and between members
and outside states. Originally constructed to provide collective security against the
Soviet Union, NATO now serves as a collective effort to reduce nuclear proliferation
and other common national security goals.

   Tools of Geopolitics

   1. True or false: Although geopolitical financial tools can be used for both
      cooperative and non-cooperative reasons, national security tools are charac-
      teristically non-cooperative. Explain your selection.
      A. True
       B. False
      Solution:
      B is correct. National security tools are non-cooperative in cases like armed
      conflict. But collective security agreements, such as NATO, can also be
      used cooperatively to reduce the possibility of conflict among members and
      between members and outside states.
      Financial tools may be cooperative in reducing geopolitical risk if they
      encourage cooperation in security, economic, or financial arenas. They may
      also tend to non-cooperation by creating vulnerabilities in the international
      system. US dominance is one such example, both promoting financial activi-
      ty and making other countries vulnerable to US monetary policy changes.


Economic Tools
Economic tools are the actions used to reinforce cooperative or non-cooperative
stances through economic means. Among state actors, economic tools can include
multilateral trade agreements, such as the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR),
which facilitates trade among member countries in South America, or the global

                          harmonization of tariff rules, as facilitated by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
                          Highly cooperative economic tools may also include common markets, like the
                          European Union, or a common currency, like the euro.
                              By contrast, economic tools can also be non-cooperative in nature. Nationalization,
                          the process of transferring an activity or industry from private to state control, is a
                          non-cooperative approach to asserting economic control. Nationalization is most
                          common in sectors perceived as vital to economic security or competitiveness, such
                          as the energy sector. For example, after a period of privatization, Argentina moved in
                          2012 to renationalize YPF, the nation’s largest energy firm. In addition to controlling
                          an important geophysical resource, Argentina’s government looked to secure the
                          sale of fossil fuels as an important source of foreign exchange, a scarcity at the time.
                          Countries can engage in voluntary export restraints, meaning they refuse to trade as
                          much of their goods and services as would meet demand. Countries also can impose
                          domestic content requirements, asserting that a certain proportion or type of domestic
                          input be included in an exported good.

                          Financial Tools
                          Financial tools are the actions used to reinforce cooperative or non-cooperative stances
                          through financial mechanisms. Examples of cooperative financial tools include the free
                          exchange of currencies across borders and allowing foreign investment. Examples of
                          non-cooperative financial tools include limiting access to local currency markets and
                          restricting foreign investment. Sanctions, described earlier, provide a useful example
                          of countries using financial tools to influence geopolitical outcomes.
                              Cooperative financial tools may reduce geopolitical risk if they encourage coop-
                          eration in security, economic, or financial arenas. However, the same tools may also
                          create vulnerabilities in the international system. The dominance of the US dollar is
                          one such example. The international interbank market, in which banks borrow and
                          lend to one another, hosts transactions heavily denominated in US dollars. The mar-
                          ket provides a tool of cooperation, and the free exchange of currency helps facilitate
                          financial activity and cooperation more broadly. That said, the US dollar’s importance
                          to exchange also makes other countries vulnerable to changes in US monetary pol-
                          icy. Specifically, tighter US monetary policy can contribute to liquidity shortages in
                          countries that do not or cannot maintain US dollar reserves.

                                system.
                                Solution:
                                Cooperative financial tools may reduce geopolitical risk if they encourage
                                cooperation in security, economic, and financial arenas. However, if the
                                system becomes too dependent on a particular financial tool or if the tool
                                becomes too dominant, it may introduce vulnerabilities in the international
                                system that can have far-reaching implications.

Multifaceted Approaches
Just as geopolitics is multifaceted and includes many types of actors and features, so
too are the tools of geopolitics. Systems of political, economic, and financial coop-
eration can be, and often are, intertwined. One interesting example is cabotage, or
the right to transport passengers or goods within a country by a foreign firm. Many
countries, including those with multilateral trade agreements, impose restrictions
on cabotage across transportation subsectors—meaning that shippers, airlines, and
truck drivers are not allowed to transport goods and services within another country’s
borders. Allowing cabotage requires coordination on areas like physical security and
economic coordination, a highly multilateral process.
    International organizations may also make use of multiple tools of geopolitics.
For example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is composed of
10 members states and seeks to facilitate economic, political, security, military, edu-
cational, and cultural integration between its members. The European Union, which
began as a six-country economic bloc, has expanded to include 27 member states (as of
2022) and features substantial financial and national security components. Generally,
as actors incorporate more tools of collaboration, they are less likely to initiate conflict
or use a non-cooperative tool against associated actors.

EUROPEAN UNION AND BREXIT

   As shown in Exhibit 10, one of the most pronounced transitions toward multi-
   lateral cooperation and globalization is in the European Union (EU). From 1945
   until 2016, European countries exhibited fairly steady progress toward political
   cooperation—via shared security, free movement of goods and people, and har-
   monization of rules and regulations—and economic and financial globalization.
   EU member states offer European citizenship and the right for workers and
   companies from all EU member states to operate within other EU countries.
   The strongest manifestation of this multilateralism is exhibited in the creation
   of the common currency for the euro area, a subset of European countries.

   In 2016, the European integration process experienced a marked disruption when
   the United Kingdom voted to exit the EU. Despite the benefits of cooperation
   and globalization, the costs became increasingly felt, affecting local politics. The
   United Kingdom’s sudden reversal in some of its multilateral momentum was
   a surprise to many global actors and investors. This geopolitical risk resulted
   in near-term market volatility, particularly in financial and currency markets.

                             It has also resulted in the dismantling of political cooperation in recent years;
                             the United Kingdom’s multilateral approach is, in some areas, shifting toward

                          Geopolitical Risk and Comparative Advantage
                          The geopolitical tools discussed in this section generate important risks and opportu-
                          nities for investors, but they do not operate in a vacuum. In fact, geopolitical risk and
                          the tools of geopolitics can shape actors’ core priorities. Models of international trade
                          will be explored later in the curriculum. (In this context, we reference them briefly
                          to illustrate how geopolitical tools can shape, destroy, or build upon a country’s core
                          approach to other actors.)
                              In the classic example of international trade, countries are endowed with certain
                          resources, or factors, and technological capabilities. Not every country will be endowed
                          with the same factors and capabilities and thus may benefit from cooperating via trade.
                          For example, Ghana is rich in resources, such as hydrocarbons, gold, agricultural
                          products, and several industrial metals. However, it relies heavily on other countries
                          for both processing and industrial use of those resources. Each country specializes in
                          areas defined by its resources and capabilities and then exchanges with the other in a
                          way that benefits both parties. Through specialization and exchange, industries within
                          each country experience greater economies of scale. Households and firms therefore
                          will have a greater variety of products to choose from. Competition between firms is
                          higher, and resources are allocated more efficiently.
                              Geopolitical risk and the tools of geopolitics can tilt comparative advantage in one
                          direction or another. For example, countries or regions with limited geopolitical risk
                          exposure may attract more labor and capital. In contrast, those with higher geopolit-
                          ical risk exposure may suffer a loss of labor and capital. Similarly, a consistent threat
                          of conflict may drive more regular volatility in asset prices, prompting investors to
                          require higher compensation for risk taken (i.e., an increase in the required rate of
                          return or the discount rate used in valuation).

                             1. True or false: Germany’s reaction to the Syrian refugee crisis is an
                                example of comparative advantage stemming from geopolitical risk. Explain
                                your selection.
                                 A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Countries with a lower geopolitical risk exposure have the abil-
                                ity to attract resources, such as labor and capital. With its strong economic
                                position in the EU and longstanding stability of political leadership, Germa-
                                ny was able to undertake the resettlement of one million Syrian refugees to
                                it while assuming the short-term relocation costs and disruption of its do-
                                mestic politics. This improves its long-term demographic balance by adding
                                young and talented migrants, with the resulting increase in labor and capital
                                stock potentially increasing Germany’s economic growth rate.

GEOPOLITICAL RISK AND THE INVESTMENT PROCESS

              describe the impact of geopolitical risk on investments

There is no shortage of attention to geopolitical risk in financial market analysis.
However, the extent to which investors incorporate geopolitical risk into their decision
making will vary widely with their investment objectives and risk tolerance. Some
investors may be considered takers of geopolitical risk. These investors may incorpo-
rate geopolitical risk into their analysis only to the extent that it affects the long-term
attractiveness of asset classes or strategies. For other investors, geopolitical risk may
be a central component of their investment process. For these portfolios, monitoring
dislocations is an achievable and meaningful driver of alpha creation, where focused
geopolitical risk analysis can reduce the impact and severity of adverse events and
enhance the potential for upside growth. For example, an investor that anticipates
an important political transition may enact portfolio hedges to shield against market
volatility or may use the market volatility as a buying opportunity—in either case,
improving investment outcomes.
    What follows is a discussion of the impact of geopolitical risk on the investment
environment. We begin with a discussion of types of geopolitical risk, followed by
a means of assessing those risks and the ways that they can manifest in a portfolio.


Types of Geopolitical Risk
There are three basic types of geopolitical risk: event risk, exogenous risk, and the-
matic risk.
    Event risk evolves around set dates, such as elections, new legislation, or other
date-driven milestones, such as holidays or political anniversaries, known in advance.
Political events often result in changes to investor expectations related to a country’s
cooperative stance. As a result, risk analysts often use political calendars as a starting
place for assessing event risk.
    One example of event risk is the United Kingdom’s referendum on European
Union membership (Exhibit 11). This was a known event risk; it was planned for 23
June 2016, well in advance. The stakes of the election were well understood, with

                          “yes” vote. Most investors expected a “no” vote; when the results proved the oppo-
                          site, investor expectations related to the United Kingdom’s cooperative stance were
                          drastically changed.

                          The United Kingdom’s vote to end its European Union membership came as a sur-
                          prise to many investors. Several asset classes were immediately affected, including
                          equities, the national currency, and government bonds. In the weeks that followed,
                          investors adjusted to the news but became concerned about what a rollback in political
                          cooperation might mean for long-term economic growth. As a result, equity prices
                          recovered, but the British pound continued on a steady decline. Government bond
                          yields declined precipitously in the month following the vote, recovering somewhat
                          as the year progressed.
                               It is useful to note that the predictability of an event does not necessarily change
                          its likelihood, its speed of impact, or the size of impact on investors; however, it does
                          give investors more time to prepare a response. We will come back to this example
                          and others in this section when we discuss the assessment of geopolitical threats.
                               Exogenous risk is a sudden or unanticipated risk that affects either a country’s
                          cooperative stance, the ability of non-state actors to globalize, or both (Exhibit 12).
                          Examples include sudden uprisings, invasions, or the aftermath of natural disasters.

                          On 11 March 2011, Japan was struck with an earthquake and subsequent tsunami wave,
                          resulting in significant loss of human life, homes, and productive capital. The natural
                          disaster also caused a significant nuclear accident that resulted in further human, prop-
                          erty, and environmental damage and also disrupted supply chains. The initial market
                          response reflected market concern: Equities fell, the currency depreciated, and bond
                          prices rose. In the weeks that followed and as the toll of the environmental disaster
                          became more apparent, Japanese equity markets continued to suffer, declining up to
                          20.4 percent (as of 25 November 2011) from their levels the day of the earthquake.
                              As the environmental costs of the accident became clear, this event contributed
                          to a shifting stance on political cooperation on environmental issues. Less than three
                          months after the incident, Germany decided to phase out nuclear power entirely by
                          2022. Belgium confirmed plans to exit nuclear power by 2025, and such countries
                          as Italy, Spain, and Switzerland opted not to reintroduce nuclear energy programs.

    Finally, thematic risks are known risks that evolve and expand over a period of
time. Climate change, pattern migration, the rise of populist forces, and the ongoing
threat of terrorism fall into this category.
    Cyber threats are another example of thematic risk (Exhibit 13). Cyber risks include
any attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal, or gain information through unau-
thorized access to or unauthorized use of computer systems. These threats began with
the expansion of internet and computer use and have increased in number and scale.
Now, the number of records stolen or affected by cyberattacks is in the billions per
year. While the basic nature of cyberattacks is consistent, the size, scale, and sophis-
tication of attacks have increased over time.

Financial services industry                     0.9%            10.3%         18.6%

In September 2017, the US consumer credit reporting company Equifax announced
a data breach that exposed personal information, including names, dates of birth,
and personal identification numbers of approximately 147 million people. The initial
market reaction was very negative. Equifax’s equity price fell by 13.7 percent in one
day and by 34.9 percent over the first week, reaching its low on 15 September 2017.
Over time, the impact moderated somewhat, but Equifax still underperformed the
financial services industry in the year after its data breach.
    At first, the data breach affected Equifax the most, including instituting protec-
tions and credit monitoring for affected customers, without significant impacts on
the broader financial industry.
    However, the event also triggered broader impacts over time. Other companies
have increased spending on cybersecurity and instituted stronger processes, including
software upgrades.

      apply.
       A. Event risk
       B. Exogenous risk
       C. Thematic risk
      Solution:
      A and C are correct.
      Event risk evolves around set dates, and thematic risk is a known risk that
      evolves and expands over a period of time. Exogenous risk is a sudden or

                          Assessing Geopolitical Threats
                          Geopolitical risk is always present in the investment environment, and these risks
                          can affects investments in many different ways—from broad macroeconomic levels,
                          to industry impacts, down to individual companies. The question for investors is
                          whether the particular geopolitical risk is relevant for their portfolio management
                          decisions. To make this assessment, an investor considers geopolitical risk in terms
                          of the following three areas:
                              ■   likelihood it will occur,
                              ■   velocity (speed) of its impact, and
                              ■   size and nature of that impact.


                          Likelihood
                          The likelihood of a risk is the probability that it will occur. Measuring likelihood is a
                          challenging process. The highly unpredictable nature of many risks—their build over
                          time, the many and conflicting motivations of actors involved—means this exercise
                          can be more art than science. However, we may use the framework from Lesson 4
                          to assess the basic likelihood of risk occurring. Highly collaborative and globalized
                          countries are, on balance, less likely to experience geopolitical risk because the polit-
                          ical, economic, and financial costs of partners inflicting those risks are higher. That
                          same interconnectedness, however, may make multilateral countries more vulnerable
                          to certain risks. Their operation in and cooperation with other countries means a risk
                          posed to any of those countries may also have an impact on itself. Similarly, multiple
                          risk exposures may increase the impact of that risk when it occurs.
                              Of course, many other factors may increase the likelihood that a risk may occur.
                          Internal political stability, economic need, and the motivations of governmental actors
                          play an important role in increasing the likelihood of disruptive action. In fact, these
                          considerations are so plentiful and intertwined that geopolitical risk monitoring
                          tools have emerged as key components of many research offerings for investors. The
                          numerous scenarios for any given risk make measuring risk likelihood a potentially
                          never-ending task. As a result, investors must balance the time spent on this activity
                          with the relative importance of its input to the investment process.
                              The examples used in the section “Types of Geopolitical Risk” in Lesson 6, can
                          help us put a finer point on this concept. Of the three risks described, a cyber risk may
                          have been the most likely to occur and to affect a given investment strategy, whereas
                          the United Kingdom’s “yes” vote and Russia’s annexation of Crimea were less likely
                          at the time in which they occurred. Of course, all three of these risks have different
                          potential impacts on investors. As a result, likelihood should be considered only in
                          conjunction with the velocity and impact of the risk.

                          Velocity
                          The velocity of geopolitical risk is the pace at which it affects an investor portfolio. For
                          the sake of simplicity, we explore short-term or “high-velocity” impacts, medium-term,
                          and long-term or “low-velocity” impacts (see Exhibit 14).
                              In the short term, we may see volatility in the markets affecting entire industries
                          or even the entire market. Exogenous or “black swan” events tend to fit into this
                          category, causing market volatility and investor flight to quality. A black swan risk is
                          an event that is rare and difficult to predict but has an important impact. Investors
                          with the appropriate time horizon and risk tolerance may make tactical changes to
                          their investment choices as a result of these events. Long-term changes are unlikely
                          to be necessary.

    Risks with a medium-term impact may begin to impair companies’ processes,
costs, and investment opportunities, resulting in lower valuations. These risks tend
to be distributed toward specific sectors, meaning they will affect some companies
much more than others.
    Long-term risks may have important environmental, social, governance, and other
impacts. This can affect an investor’s asset allocation—including choice of asset classes
and investment styles—for a long-term horizon; however, the immediate impact on
portfolios is likely to be more limited.

Note that some risks have more than one speed of impact on investments. The United
Kingdom’s referendum outcome to exit the EU had some immediate impacts, notably
a decline in the value of the British pound sterling and other forms of market vola-
tility. Over time, low-velocity impacts have become more apparent and more lasting
for investors. Higher transaction costs and the unwind of previous forms of political
cooperation—including the freedom of movement between the United Kingdom
and the EU—are generating important impacts on investment outcomes and overall
economic growth.

                                the probability that geopolitical risk will occur. The velocity of its impact is
                                the pace at which it affects an investor portfolio. The impact can manifest in
                                many ways and can be discrete in size or broad in nature.



                          Impact of Geopolitical Risk
                          A risk’s impact on investor portfolios can manifest in many different ways. For the sake
                          of this framework for assessing risk, suffice it to say that investors should consider the
                          size of any risk’s impact when gauging its importance to the investment process. A
                          high-impact risk may merit extensive study of its drivers and motivations, whereas a
                          low-impact risk may not. In addition, the size of a risk’s impact may be compounded
                          by external factors. For example, risk tends to have a greater impact on markets
                          experiencing a general contraction or economic downturn.
                               Impact may also be discrete or broad in nature. Discrete impacts are those that
                          affect only one company or sector at a time, whereas broad impacts are felt more
                          holistically by a sector, a country, or the global economy. Cyber risks may be consid-
                          ered in this light. In the event of a cyberattack, only the companies and investment
                          strategies exposed to that company will be affected. However, cyber risks may also
                          have a broader impact by increasing monitoring, due diligence, and security costs for
                          all companies and investors seeking to avoid them.
                               When assessing geopolitical risk for portfolio management, investors should
                          consider all three geopolitical risk factors—likelihood, velocity, and size and nature
                          of impact—together. For example, a highly likely risk with very little impact to the
                          portfolio may not merit extensive analysis and investor attention. However, a highly
                          impactful risk with a low likelihood of occurring may merit building a scenario for
                          response but not regular monitoring and assessment. Between these extremes, investors
                          must consider their goals and risk tolerance to identify high-priority risks.

                          Scenario Analysis
                          Geopolitical risks seldom develop in linear fashion, making it difficult to monitor
                          and forecast their likelihood, velocity, and impact on a portfolio as well as difficult to
                          address those changes through portfolio action. As a result, many investors deploy
                          an approach that includes scenario analysis and signposting rather than a single point
                          forecast.
                              Scenario analysis is the process of evaluating portfolio outcomes across potential
                          circumstances or states of the world. Scenarios help investment teams understand
                          where they stand with respect to a risk that might cause them to change their behavior.
                          Scenario analysis can strengthen a team’s conviction about its prioritization and calls
                          to action, thereby helping it make good investment choices at opportune moments.
                              Scenarios can take the form of qualitative analysis, quantitative measurement, or
                          both. A simple framework for qualitative scenario building begins with developing a
                          base case for the event. What is the most impactful outcome of the risk? How likely

is that risk/outcome to occur in the first place? From there, investors can consider
upside and downside scenarios. Is it a persistent tail risk or a short-term shock? How
are markets likely to recover once the event has taken place? Considering alternate
futures for key risks will drive more precise perspective around what constitutes key
developments in the most important risks.
    Quantitative scenarios can vary widely by sophistication. One form of a simple
quantitative scenario is a stylized scenario in which portfolio sensitivity is measured
against one key factor relevant to the portfolio, such as interest rates, asset prices, or
exchange rates. Another involves using circumstances from extreme events to help
build quantitative tests for portfolio resilience. It is important to have reasonable ambi-
tions, however. Quantitative scenarios can be complicated because of the secondary
and linked impacts of geopolitical risks to securities in the portfolio.
    Good scenario building can prompt investors to alter their risk prioritization,
making it a useful tool not only for tracking risks but also for deciding which portfo-
lio actions may be valuable to take. Good scenario analysis also requires a consistent
commitment of investors’ time and resources. Teams that read similar research or
speak with similar client groups may be affected by groupthink, the practice of think-
ing or making decisions as a group in a way that discourages creativity or individual
responsibility. For scenario analysis to be useful in portfolio management, teams must
work hard to build creative processes, identify and track scenarios, and assess the
need for action on a regular basis.


Tracking Risks According to Signposts
To build a portfolio’s resilience to unexpected change, asset managers develop pro-
cesses in advance that allow for rapid course correction. In other words, by creating
plans for addressing priority risks as they occur, investors can help reduce the events’
impact on investment outcomes.
    One important process is identifying signposts for priority risk. A signpost is
an indicator, market level, data piece, or event that signals a risk is becoming more
or less likely. An analyst can think of signposts like a traffic light. If quantitative and
qualitative evidence suggest that a risk is low in likelihood, velocity, or impact, then
the signposts are flashing green, or no action needed. If signposts are flashing amber,
indicating that a risk is medium in likelihood, velocity, or impact, then higher caution
and preparedness against that risk may be warranted. As a risk rises in likelihood,
velocity, or impact, an action plan may be necessary.
    Identifying signposts should equip a team to differentiate signal from noise and
react when signposts flash red. For instance, when the market environment moves to
either risk-on or risk-off, it is important to identify what actions should be taken next
or communications made. Good signposts are anchored in the key assumptions made
up-front around a scenario and mark whether a scenario is materializing.
    Let’s return to our example of the United Kingdom’s Brexit referendum for con-
text. Before 2014, signposts for geopolitical risk in the United Kingdom may have
flashed “green.” Attitudes toward European Union membership were divided, and
while there is always a possibility of disruptive geopolitical change, a reduction in
political cooperation with the European Union was not clearly defined. Then, when
the referendum was announced in 2015, signposts for disruptive change became more
likely and faster in potential velocity, resulting in a higher required level of portfolio
manager attention. In May 2016, when phone polls suggested that the “leave” vote
was moving to the majority, signposts flashed “red” and attentive portfolio managers
prepared action plans for election day.
    Identifying the right signposts can require some trial and error. A basic rule of
thumb for distinguishing signal from noise is the distinction between politics and
policy. For example, there can be a big difference in “politics” between two leaders,

186   Learning Module 5                                                             Introduction to Geopolitics


                          but the “policies” they enact are what create larger or more durable portfolio impacts.
                          Political developments can serve as meaningful signposts, as they can indicate a change
                          in the risk’s likelihood or pace. However, analysts are frequently knocked off course
                          by following developments that do not necessarily indicate a change in real economic
                          or market outcomes. Instead, analysts should look for policy changes to guide their
                          portfolio management decisions.
                              Some combinations of economic and financial market circumstances serve as
                          strong warnings of potential trouble. For example, high inflation and deteriorating
                          employment can signal political unrest. A pegged currency and rapidly declining export
                          value (particularly for commodities exporters) can prompt a change in exchange rate
                          policy. Often, particularly for emerging markets, these signposts will change before
                          official data are released. If a portfolio relies on country-level economic conditions,
                          data screens should be used to help identify any red flags early.


                          Manifestations of Geopolitical Risk
                          If geopolitical risk takes many forms, its impact on investor portfolios is just as mul-
                          tifaceted. High-velocity risks are most likely to manifest in market volatility through
                          prompt changes in asset prices. Commonly affected asset prices include commodities,
                          foreign exchange, equities, and bond prices (via changes in interest rates).
                              One example is the market response to economic shutdowns related to the
                          COVID-19 pandemic (Exhibit 15). Using the United States as an example, the S&P
                          500 Index fell from a level of 3,386 on 19 February 2020 to 2,237.4 on 23 March, a
                          decline of nearly 34%. Bonds also experienced volatility. Global investors’ “flight to
                          safety” pushed up US bond prices. The US 10-year Treasury yield fell from 1.5661 to a
                          low of 0.5407 during that period, a decline of nearly 68 percent. This volatility was not
                          permanent but created ample risk—and opportunity—for investors during that time.

an instructive example. While risk asset valuations improved over the course of the
pandemic, disruptions to mobility and consumption had long-lasting impacts on
company revenues and supply chains.
    For countries, regions, or sectors perceived to be at more consistent risk of geo-
political disruption, investors may require higher compensation, effectively increasing
the discount rate investors use when valuing those securities. Portfolio investment
flows face greater volatility because of geopolitical factors, and investors will factor
in a higher risk premium. This dynamic is a key reason why asset prices in emerging
and frontier markets are typically maintained at a discount to those in developed
countries that are perceived to have a lower threat of risk.

GEOPOLITICAL RISK INDEX

  In a 2019 paper, two analysts at the US Federal Reserve Board of Governors
  built the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) based on a tally of news articles covering
  geopolitical tensions and their impact on economic events. The purpose of the
  index is to measure real-time geopolitical risk as perceived by the press, the
  public, global investors, and policymakers in a way that is consistent over time.

      Through their construction of the GPR, the authors made three important
  observations. First, they found that high levels of geopolitical risk reduce US
  investment, employment, and price level of the stock market. Second, and taking
  this observation deeper, the authors found that individual firm’s investment falls
  more in industries positively exposed to geopolitical risk and that firms reduce
  investment in the wake of idiosyncratic geopolitical risk events. Finally, they
  studied the adverse effect of geopolitical events themselves as well as the threat
  of adverse events, finding that the threat of events had a larger impact over time.

      A. True
      B. False
     Solution:
     B is correct. Higher-velocity risks are most likely to manifest in market
     volatility via prompt changes in asset prices. Lower-velocity geopolitical
     risks are likely to have a prolonged impact on investor inputs. The terror-

                             Geopolitical Risk

                             1. True or false: The probability and impact of geopolitical risks influence rela-
                                tive asset price discount rates across emerging and developed markets.

                                Explain your selection.
                                 A. True
                                 B. False
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. For countries, regions, or sectors perceived to be at more con-
                                sistent risk of geopolitical disruption, investors may require higher compen-
                                sation, effectively increasing the discount rate used in valuation. When port-
                                folio investment flows face greater volatility because of geopolitical factors,
                                investors will factor in a higher risk premium. This explains why asset prices
                                in emerging markets typically are maintained at a discount to those in devel-
                                oped countries perceived to have a lower threat of geopolitical risk, with the
                                latter more likely to experience lower probability risks with lesser impacts.



                          Acting on Geopolitical Risk
                          Determining the likelihood, velocity, and impact of a risk may help an investor to assign
                          priority to which risks might be most important. But if the risk does occur, what, if
                          anything, can be done about it? Even if an investor could anticipate every risk and
                          its impact on their portfolios, they must still consider whether and how to act in the
                          face of such threats. A final step in incorporating geopolitical risk into the portfolio
                          management process thus requires that geopolitical risk analysis be translated into
                          investment action as appropriate for investor goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
                               Taking a top-down approach, asset allocators may consider geopolitical risk in
                          their asset allocation strategy. The likelihood, velocity, and impact of risks may affect
                          key capital markets assumptions as well as an asset allocator’s positioning in certain
                          countries or regions. For example, countries with a long history of using a multilateral
                          approach may be considered more reliable investments and see increased investor
                          flows. In contrast, those countries experiencing consistent military threat may have
                          lower economic and investment growth potential because of consistent disruptions.
                          The asset allocator would thus allocate more capital to the countries with lower
                          expected risk profiles.
                               At the portfolio management level, investors can consider geopolitical risk as a
                          factor in multifactor models. Imagine an analyst assessing global car manufacturers.
                          A company with highly diversified production may be exposed to more risk (i.e.,
                          higher likelihood), but production would be less likely to come to a halt given the
                          multiple production alternatives (i.e., lower impact). When making a buy or sell rec-
                          ommendation, the analyst may consider relative geopolitical risk exposure as a factor
                          in their analysis. Disruptive threats may be used as a binary yes-or-no factor or they
                          can affect the confidence intervals around factors related to momentum, valuation,
                          market sentiment, or the economic cycle.

Geopolitical Risk and the Investment Process                                              189


    Ultimately, the importance of geopolitical risk to the investment process depends
on investor objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon. For an investor with low risk
tolerance, reducing exposure to geopolitical risk may be appropriate, whether through
low-volatility investment choices or through hedging.
    For an investor with a long time horizon, a geopolitical event like an exogenous
shock could be a buying opportunity. For an investor nearing retirement, however,
that same exogenous shock can have a major negative impact on their terminal port-
folio value.
    The extensive political, economic, and financial cooperation in which countries,
companies, and organizations participate may raise the stakes of geopolitical risk
analysis for global investors. Changes in the style and momentum of international
cooperation can have an important impact on capital markets. Global investors ignore
those risks at their peril.

                             PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                          1. Which of the following statements regarding a country’s political cooperation is
                             most accurate?
                              A. If a country is engaged in military conflict, there is a higher cost to
                                 cooperation.

                              B. A country with few internal resources is not likely to rely on political
                                 cooperation.

                              C. Interest prioritization does not determine the depth and nature of political
                                 cooperation.

                          2. A consequence of one of the disadvantages of globalization is that:
                              A. pay differences between countries have narrowed.

                              B. emerging market trade flows have grown more important.

                              C. greater economic and financial cooperation has increased interdependence.

                          3. Which of the following outcomes is most likely a result of globalization?
                              A. Unequal gains

                              B. Increased independence

                              C. Decreased access to talent

                          4. A US company expanding critical spare part inventories for local customers
                             made at its existing Canadian facility after a supply chain disruption is most likely
                             using the coping tactic of:
                              A. reshoring the essentials.

                              B. reglobalizing production.

                              C. doubling down on key markets.

                          5. An example of a geopolitical multifaceted tool for furthering national interests is:
                              A. cabotage.

                              B. armed conflict.

                              C. nationalization of key export industries.

                          6. Which of these is most likely to be described as an event risk?
                              A. An earthquake

                              B. An election

                              C. An ongoing civil war

                          7. Exogenous risks are best described as those that:
                              A. are known and evolve and expand over a period of time.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. A is correct. If a country is engaged in military conflict, there is a higher cost to
                             cooperation. B is incorrect because a country with few internal resources is likely
                             to rely on political cooperation. C is incorrect because interest prioritization does
                             determine the depth and nature of political cooperation.

                          2. C is correct. Through the process of greater economic and financial cooperation,
                             companies may become dependent on other countries’ resources for their supply
                             chains. On aggregate, this can result in the nation itself becoming dependent on
                             other nations for certain resources (such as rare earth metals, cobalt, or copper).
                             If there is a disruption to the supply chain, including via a moment of political
                             non-cooperation, then firms may not be able to produce the good themselves.
                             A is incorrect because the narrowing of pay differences between countries results
                             from a motivation to pursue globalization, which is related to one of its advantag-
                             es. It is an important way for companies to increase profitability by reducing their
                             costs. Although wage differentials remain, they are decreasing. B is incorrect
                             because the proportion of flows between developed economies as a share of over-
                             all trade continuing to decline as emerging market trade flows rise is a function
                             of increased international investment. This increased investment has provided
                             beneficial aggregate economic benefits, such as increased choice, higher quality
                             goods, increased competition among firms, higher efficiency, and increased labor
                             mobility.

                          3. A is correct. Unequal accrual of economic and financial gains is a cost of glo-
                             balization because improvement on the aggregate does not mean improvement
                             for everyone. B is incorrect because globalization leads to interdependency as
                             companies may become dependent on other countries’ resources for their supply
                             chains. C is incorrect because rather than decreased access to talent, a country
                             might actually globalize to improve access to talent as cooperation and globaliza-
                             tion can lead to increased access to resources.

                          4. A is correct. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for certain
                             essential supply chains to be rebuilt domestically for emergency situations, with
                             availability of critical spare parts being an analogy. The close integration of the
                             US and Canadian economies through the revised USMCA agreement effective-
                             ly makes expanded production at an existing Canadian factory an example of
                             reducing manufacturing risk by relocating to home countries via reshoring. B
                             is incorrect because instead of reducing manufacturing risk by duplicating or
                             fortifying its supply chain, the company is simply continuing to use its existing
                             capacity more intensively. C is incorrect because although the production is
                             intended to better supply its home market, there is no evidence that the company
                             is expanding its presence in the US market or shifting its focus to the exclusion of
                             available opportunities elsewhere.

                          5. A is correct. Cabotage is the right to transport passengers or goods within a
                             country by a foreign firm. Many countries—including those with multilateral
                             trade agreements—impose restrictions on cabotage across transportation subsec-
                             tors, meaning that shippers, airlines, and truck drivers are not allowed to trans-
                             port goods and services within another country’s borders. Allowing cabotage
                             requires coordination on areas like physical security and economic coordination,
                             a highly multilateral (multifaceted tool) process. B is incorrect because armed
                             conflict is the most extreme example of a national security tool. It can be either
                             internal or external to a country in taking a direct and active approach to wield-

   ing influence. C is incorrect because nationalization of key export industries is an
   economic tool. This process of transferring an activity or industry from private to
   state control is a non-cooperative approach to asserting economic control.

6. B is correct. Event risk evolves around set dates, such as elections and new
   legislation, or other date-driven milestones, such as holidays or political anniver-
   saries known in advance. The other choices could not be known in advance. An
   earthquake (A) is an example of an exogenous risk. An ongoing civil war (C) is an
   example of a thematic risk.

7. C is correct. Exogenous risks are best described as those that are sudden or
   unanticipated and that affect either a country’s cooperative stance, the ability
   of non-state actors to globalize, or both. A is incorrect because thematic (not
   exogenous) risks are known risks that evolve and expand over a period of time. B
   is incorrect because event (not exogenous) risks are those that evolve around set
   dates, including elections, new legislation, or other date-driven milestones.

8. B is correct. Although highly collaborative and globalized countries are, on
   balance, less likely to experience geopolitical risk because the political, economic,
   and financial costs of partners inflicting those risks are higher than less collabo-
   rative countries, the same interconnectedness may make them more vulnerable
   to geopolitical risk. A is incorrect because geopolitical risk is always present in
   the investment environment. C is incorrect because geopolitical risk tends to
   have a greater impact on markets already experiencing a general contraction or
   economic downturn.

9. A is correct. The GPR creators found that high levels of geopolitical risk re-
   duce US investment, employment, and price level of the stock market. B is
   incorrect because firms reduce investment in the wake of idiosyncratic events,
   which would be unlikely to repeat. C is incorrect because the threat of an event
   was shown to have a larger impact over time than that of the actual events
   themselves.

10. B is correct. Event risk evolves around set dates, such as elections or new legisla-
    tion, or other date-driven milestones, such as holidays or political anniversaries.
    Analysts can thus look to political calendars as a predictable starting point for
    determining the occurrence of event risk, with time to devise a suitable response.
    A is incorrect because exogenous risk is sudden and unanticipated. Examples
    include sudden uprisings, invasions, or the aftermath of natural disasters. The
    timing and range of its effects thus have the greatest unknowns. C is incorrect
    because thematic risks are known risks that evolve and expand over a period of
    time. Climate change, pattern migration, the rise of populist forces, and the on-
    going threat of terrorism fall into this category. These are more foreseeable than
    exogenous risks, but with their extended interval of exposure, planned responses
    likely require continual adjustments.

INTRODUCTION
From an investment perspective, it is important for global investors to understand
                                                                                           1
existing trade policies. Such policies can affect the volume and value of trade and thus
can affect the return on investment. Investors need to be aware of potential changes
in the government’s trade policy. Such changes have important implications for firm
profitability and growth by affecting the demand for its products and its pricing. There
has been much debate among economists on the role of trade and trade policy and
its impact on the overall economy. This learning module examines the benefits and
cost of international trade. It then describes trade restrictions and their implications
and discusses the motivation for, and advantages of, the different types of trading
blocs or trade agreements.

                                 ■   Newer models of trade focus on the gains from trade that result
                                     from economies of scale, greater product variety, and increased
                                     competition.
                                 ■   Opponents of free trade point to the potential for greater income
                                     inequality and the loss of jobs in developed market countries as a
                                     result of import competition.
                                 ■   The fact that trade increases overall welfare does not mean that every
                                     individual consumer and producer is better off. What it does mean is
                                     that the winners could, in theory, compensate the losers and still be
                                     better off.
                                 ■   Trade restrictions (or trade protection) are government policies that
                                     limit the ability of domestic households and firms to trade freely with
                                     other countries.
                                 ■   Tariffs are taxes that a government levies on imported goods. The pri-
                                     mary objective of tariffs is to protect domestic industries that produce
                                     the same or similar goods. They also may aim to reduce a trade deficit.
                                 ■   The net welfare effect of tariffs is the sum of consumer surplus,
                                     producer surplus and government tax revenue. The loss in consumer
                                     surplus is greater than the sum of the gain in producer surplus and
                                     government revenue and results in a deadweight loss to the country’s
                                     welfare.
                                 ■   A quota restricts the quantity of a good that can be imported into a
                                     country, generally for a specified period of time. A voluntary export
                                     restraint (VER) is a trade barrier under which the exporting country
                                     agrees to limit its exports of the good to its trading partners to a spe-
                                     cific number of units.
                                 ■   An export subsidy is a payment by the government to a firm for each
                                     unit of a good that is exported. Its goal is to stimulate exports.
                                 ■   A regional trading bloc is a group of countries that have signed an
                                     agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and
                                     the movement of factors of production among the members of the
                                     bloc.
                                 ■   There are many different types of regional trading blocs, depending on
                                     the level of integration that takes place. These include free trade areas,
                                     customs union, common market, and economic union.
                                 ■   Trade creation occurs when regional integration results in the replace-

                                     other members. Trade diversion occurs when lower-cost imports from
                                     non-member countries are replaced with higher-cost imports from
                                     members.

Benefits and Costs of Trade                                                                 197


Over the past few decades, the global economy has experienced rapid growth in trade
and a growing interdependence among countries. This has led to a debate among policy
makers over whether the expansion of trade has been helpful for individual national
economies. This lesson examines the possible benefits and costs of international trade.


Benefits and Costs of International Trade
The benefits and costs of international trade are widely debated. The most compelling
arguments supporting international trade are as follows: countries gain from exchange
and specialization, industries experience greater economies of scale, households and
firms have greater product variety, competition is increased, and resources are allo-
cated more efficiently.
     Gains from exchange occur when trade enables each country to receive a higher
price for its exports (and greater profit) or pay a lower price for imported goods
instead of producing these goods domestically at a higher cost (i.e., less efficiently).
This exchange, in turn, leads to a more efficient allocation of resources by increasing
production of the export good and reducing production of the import good in each
country (trading partner). This efficiency allows for consumption of a larger bundle
of goods, thus increasing overall welfare. The fact that trade increases overall welfare
does not mean, of course, that every individual consumer and producer is better off.
What it does mean is that the winners could, in theory, compensate the losers and
still be better off.
     Trade also leads to greater efficiency by fostering specialization based on com-
parative advantage. Traditional trade models, such as the Ricardian model and the
Heckscher–Ohlin model, focus on specialization and trade according to comparative
advantage arising from differences in technology and factor endowments, respectively.
     Newer models of trade focus on the gains from trade that result from economies
of scale, greater product variety, and increased competition. In an open economy,
increased competition from foreign firms reduces the monopoly power of domestic
firms and forces them to become more efficient, in contrast to a closed economy.
Industries that exhibit increasing returns to scale (e.g., the automobile and steel
industries) benefit from increased market size as a country starts trading because
the average cost of production declines as output increases in these industries.
Monopolistically competitive models of trade have been used to explain why there is
significant two-way trade (known as intra-industry trade) between countries within
the same industry. Intra-industry trade occurs when a country exports and imports
goods in the same product category or classification.
     A monopolistically competitive industry has many firms; each firm produces
a unique or differentiated product: it does not have any exit or entry barriers, and
long-run economic profits are zero. In such a model, even though countries may be
similar, they gain from trade because each country focuses on the production and
export of one or more varieties of the good and imports other varieties of the good. For
example, the European Union exports and imports different types of cars. Consumers
gain from having access to a greater variety of final goods. Firms benefit from greater
economies of scale because firms both within and outside the EU are able to sell their
goods in both markets. Hence, scale economies allow firms to benefit from the larger
market size and experience lower average cost of production as a result of trade.
     Research suggests that trade liberalization can lead to increased real (i.e.,
inflation-adjusted) GDP although the strength of this relationship is still debated. The
positive influence of trade on GDP can arise from more efficient allocation of resources,
learning by doing, higher productivity, knowledge spillovers, and trade-induced changes
in policies and institutions that affect the incentives for innovation. In industries
that embrace “learning by doing,” such as the semiconductor industry, the cost of
production per unit declines as output increases because of expertise and experience

                          acquired in the process of production. Trade can lead to increased exchange of ideas,
                          freer flow of technical expertise, and greater awareness of changing consumer tastes
                          and preferences in global markets. It also can contribute to the development of higher
                          quality and more effective institutions and policies that encourage domestic innovation.
                          For example, studies have shown that foreign research and development (R&D) has
                          beneficial effects on domestic productivity, which become stronger the more open
                          an economy is to foreign trade. For example, some estimate that about a quarter of
                          the benefits of R&D investment in a G–7 country accrues to their trading partners.
                          Consider Logitech, a Swiss company that manufactures computer mice. To win original
                          equipment manufacturer (OEM) contracts from IBM and Apple, Logitech needed to
                          develop innovative designs and provide high-volume production at a low cost. So in
                          the late 1980s, the company moved to Taiwan Region, which had a highly qualified
                          labor force, competent parts suppliers, a rapidly expanding local computer industry,
                          and offered Logitech space in a science park at a competitive rate. Soon thereafter,
                          Logitech was able to secure the Apple contract.
                              Opponents of free trade point to the potential for greater income inequality and
                          the loss of jobs in developed countries as a result of import competition. As a country
                          moves toward free trade, adjustments will be made in domestic industries that are
                          exporters as well as in those that face import competition. Resources (investments)
                          may need to be reallocated into or out of an industry depending on whether that
                          industry is expanding (exporters) or contracting (i.e., facing import competition).
                          As a result of this adjustment process, less-efficient firms may be forced to exit the
                          industry, which, in turn, may lead to higher unemployment and the need for displaced
                          workers to be retrained for jobs in expanding industries. The counter argument is
                          that although there may be short-term and even some medium-term costs, these
                          resources are likely to be more effectively (re-)employed in other industries in the
                          long run. Nonetheless, the adjustment process is virtually certain to impose costs on
                          some groups of stakeholders.

                           QUESTION SET

                             Consider two countries that each produce two goods. Suppose the cost
                             of producing cotton relative to lumber is lower in Cottonland than in
                             Lumberland.

                             1. How would trade between the two countries affect the lumber industry in
                                Lumberland?
                                Solution:
                                The lumber industry in Lumberland would benefit from trade. Because the
                                cost of producing lumber relative to producing cotton is lower in Lumber-
                                land than in Cottonland (i.e., lumber is relatively cheap in Lumberland),
                                Lumberland will export lumber and the industry will expand.

                             2. How would trade between the two countries affect the lumber industry in
                                Cottonland?
                                Solution:
                                The lumber industry in Cottonland would not benefit from trade, at least in
                                the short run. Because lumber is relatively expensive to produce in Cotton-
                                land, the domestic lumber industry will shrink as lumber is imported from
                                Lumberland.

  3. What would happen to the lumber industry workers in Cottonland in the
     long run?
     Solution:
     The overall welfare effect in both countries is positive. However, in the short
     run, many lumber producers in Cottonland (and cotton producers in Lum-
     berland) are likely to find themselves without jobs as the lumber industry
     in Cottonland and the cotton industry in Lumberland contract. Those with
     skills that also are needed in the other industry may find jobs fairly quickly.
     Others are likely to do so after some re-training. In the long run, displaced
     workers should be able to find jobs in the expanding export industry. Those
     who remain in the import-competing industry, however, may be permanent-
     ly worse off because their industry-specific skills are now less valuable. Thus,
     even in the long run, trade does not necessarily make every stakeholder
     better off. But the winners could compensate the losers and still be better
     off, so the overall welfare effect of opening trade is positive.

  4. What is the meaning of the expression “gains from trade”?
     Solution:
     Gains from trade imply that the overall benefits of trade outweigh the losses
     from trade. It does not mean that all stakeholders (producers, consumers,
     government) benefit (or benefit equally) from trade.

  5. What are some of the benefits from trade?
     Solution:
     Some of the benefits from trade include the following: gains from exchange
     and specialization based on relative cost advantage; gains from economies of
     scale as the companies add new markets for their products; greater vari-
     ety of products available to households and firms; greater efficiency from
     increased competition; and more efficient allocation of resources.




TRADE RESTRICTIONS AND AGREEMENTS—TARIFFS,
QUOTAS, AND EXPORT SUBSIDIES                                                              3
              compare types of trade restrictions, such as tariffs, quotas, and
              export subsidies, and their economic implications

Trade restrictions (or trade protection) are government policies that limit the ability
of domestic households and firms to trade freely with other countries. Examples of
trade restrictions include tariffs, import quotas, voluntary export restraints (VER),
subsidies, embargoes, and domestic content requirements. Tariffs are taxes that a
government levies on imported goods. Quotas restrict the quantity of a good that
can be imported into a country, generally for a specified period of time. A voluntary
export restraint is similar to a quota but is imposed by the exporting country. An
export subsidy is paid by the government to the firm when it exports a unit of a
good that is being subsidized. The goal is to promote exports, but it reduces welfare
by encouraging production and trade that is inconsistent with comparative advantage.
Domestic content provisions stipulate that some percentage of the value added or

                          components used in production should be of domestic origin. Trade restrictions are
                          imposed by countries for several reasons, including protecting established domestic
                          industries from foreign competition, protecting new industries from foreign competi-
                          tion until they mature (infant industry argument), protecting and increasing domestic
                          employment, protecting strategic industries for national security reasons, generating
                          revenue from tariffs (especially for developing countries), and retaliation against trade
                          restrictions imposed by other countries.
                              Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners’ ability to own
                          domestic assets or domestic residents’ ability to own foreign assets. Thus, in contrast
                          with trade restrictions, which limit the openness of goods markets, capital restrictions
                          limit the openness of financial markets and will be addressed later.


                          Tariffs
                          Tariffs are taxes that a government levies on imported goods. The primary objective
                          of tariffs is to protect domestic industries that produce the same or similar goods.
                          They also may aim to reduce a trade deficit. Tariffs reduce the demand for imported
                          goods by increasing their price above the free trade price. The economic impact of a
                          tariff on imports in a small country is illustrated in Exhibit 1. In this context, a small
                          country is not necessarily small in size, population, or GDP. Instead, a small country
                          is one that is a price taker in the world market for a product and cannot influence the
                          world market price. For example, by many measures, Brazil is a large country, but it is
                          a price taker in the world market for cars. A large country, however, is a large importer
                          of the product and can exercise some influence on price in the world market. When
                          a large country imposes a tariff, the exporter reduces the price of the good to retain
                          some of the market share it could lose if it did not lower its price.
                              This reduction in price alters the terms of trade and represents a redistribution
                          of income from the exporting country to the importing country. So, in theory, it is
                          possible for a large country to increase its welfare by imposing a tariff if (1) its trading
                          partner does not retaliate and (2) the deadweight loss as a result of the tariff (see below)
                          is smaller than the benefit of improving its terms of trade. Global welfare, however,
                          would still experience a net reduction—the large country cannot gain by imposing a
                          tariff unless it imposes an even larger loss on its trading partner.
                              In Exhibit 1, the world price (free trade price) is P*. Under free trade, domestic
                          supply is Q1, domestic consumption is Q4, and imports are Q1Q4. After the imposi-
                          tion of a per-unit tariff t, the domestic price increases to Pt, which is the sum of the
                          world price and the per-unit tariff t. At the new domestic price, domestic production
                          increases to Q2 and domestic consumption declines to Q3, resulting in a reduction
                          in imports to Q2Q3.

The welfare effects of the tariff can be summarized as follows:
    ■       Consumers suffer a loss of consumer surplus because of the increase in
            price. In Exhibit 1, this effect is represented by areas A + B + C + D.
    ■       Local producers gain producer surplus from a higher price for their output.
            This effect is represented by area A.
    ■       The government gains tariff revenue on imports Q2Q3. This effect is repre-
            sented by area C.
   The net welfare effect is the sum of these three effects and is summarized in
Exhibit 2. The loss in consumer surplus is greater than the sum of the gain in producer
surplus and government revenue and results in a deadweight loss to the country’s
welfare of B + D.

Tariffs create deadweight loss because they give rise to inefficiencies on both the con-
sumption and production side. B represents inefficiencies in production. Instead of
being able to import goods at the world price P*, tariffs encourage inefficient producers
whose cost of production is greater than P* to enter (or remain in) the market, lead-
ing to an inefficient allocation of resources. On the consumption side, tariffs prevent
mutually beneficial exchanges from occurring because consumers who were willing
to pay more than P* but less than Pt are now unable to consume the good.

                             Analysis of a Tariff
                             South Africa manufactures 110,000 tons of paper. However, domestic demand
                             for paper is 200,000 tons. The world price for paper is USD5.00 per ton. South
                             Africa will import 90,000 tons of paper from the world market at free trade
                             prices. If the South African government (a small country) decides to impose a
                             tariff of 20 percent on paper imports, the price of imported paper will increase
                             to USD6.00. Domestic production after the imposition of the tariff increases to
                             130,000 tons, while the quantity demanded declines to 170,000 tons.

                             1. Calculate the loss in consumer surplus arising from the imposition of the
                                tariff on imported paper.
                                Solution:
                                The loss in consumer surplus = USD1 × 170,000 + 1/2 × USD1 × 30,000
                                = USD185,000. This calculation is represented by areas A + B + C + D in
                                Exhibit 1.

                             2. Calculate the gain in producer surplus arising from the imposition of the
                                tariff.
                                Solution:
                                Gain in producer surplus = USD1 × 110,000 + 1/2 × (USD1 × 20,000) =
                                USD120,000; Area A in Exhibit 1.

                             3. Calculate the gain in government revenue arising from the imposition of the
                                tariff.
                                Solution:
                                Change in government revenue = USD1 × 40,000 = USD40,000; Area C in
                                Exhibit 1.

                             4. Calculate the deadweight loss arising from the imposition of the tariff.
                                Solution:
                                Deadweight loss because of the tariff = 1/2 × USD1 × 20,000 + 1/2 × USD1 ×
                                30,000 = USD 25,000; Areas B + D in Exhibit 1.



                          Quotas
                          A quota restricts the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country, gener-
                          ally for a specified period of time. An import license specifies the quantity that can
                          be imported. For example, the European Union operates a system of annual import
                          quotas for steel producers who are not members of the World Trade Organization. A
                          key difference between tariffs and quotas is that the government is able to collect the
                          revenue generated from a tariff. This effect is uncertain under a quota. With quotas,
                          foreign producers can often raise the price of their goods and earn greater profits than
                          they would without the quota. These profits are called quota rents. In Exhibit 1, if
                          the quota is Q2Q3, the equivalent tariff that will restrict imports to Q2Q3 is t and the
                          domestic price after the quota is Pt. This is the same as the domestic price after the
                          tariff t was imposed. Area C, however, is now the quota rent or profits that are likely
                          to be captured by the foreign producer rather than tariff revenue that is captured by
                          the domestic government. If the foreign producer or foreign government captures the

Trade Restrictions and Agreements—Tariffs, Quotas, and Export Subsidies                                              203


quota rent, C, then the welfare loss to the importing country, represented by areas
B + D + C in Exhibit 1, under a quota is greater than under the equivalent tariff. If
the government of the country that imposes the quota can capture the quota rents
by auctioning the import licenses for a fee, then the welfare loss under the quota is
similar to that of a tariff, represented by areas B + D.
    A VER is a trade barrier under which the exporting country agrees to limit its
exports of the good to its trading partners to a specific number of units. The main
difference between an import quota and a VER is that the former is imposed by the
importer, whereas the latter is imposed by the exporter. The VER allows the quota
rent resulting from the decrease in trade to be captured by the exporter (or export-
ing country), whereas in the case of an import quota, there is ambiguity regarding
who captures the quota rents. Hence, a VER results in welfare loss in the importing
country. For example, in 1981, the Japanese government imposed VERs on automobile
exports to the United States.


Export Subsidies
An export subsidy is a payment by the government to a firm for each unit of a good
that is exported. Its goal is to stimulate exports. But it interferes with the functioning
of the free market and may distort trade away from comparative advantage. Hence,
it reduces welfare. Countervailing duties are duties that are levied by the importing
country against subsidized exports entering the country. As an example, agricultural
subsidies in developed countries, notably the EU, have been a contentious issue in
trade negotiations with emerging market countries and developed market countries
that are agricultural exporters, such as New Zealand and Australia.
    In the case of an export subsidy, the exporter has the incentive to shift sales from
the domestic to the export market because it receives the international price plus the
per-unit subsidy for each unit of the good exported. This scenario raises the price in
the domestic market by the amount of the subsidy in the small country case (price
before subsidy plus subsidy). In the large country case, the world price declines as
the large country increases exports. The net welfare effect is negative in both the
large and small country cases, with a larger decline in the large country case. In the
large country case, the decline in world prices implies that a part of the subsidy is
transferred to the foreign country, unlike in the small country case.
    Exhibit 3 summarizes some of these effects.

                                           Analysis of Trade Restrictions
                                           Thailand, a small country, has to decide whether to impose a tariff or a quota
                                           on the import of computers. You are considering investing in a local firm that
                                           is a major importer of computers.

                                           1. What will be the impact of a tariff on prices, quantity produced, and quanti-
                                              ty imported in Thailand (the importing country)?
                                             Solution:
                                             A tariff imposed by a small country, such as Thailand, raises the price of
                                             computers in the importing country, reduces the quantity imported, and
                                             increases domestic production.

                                           2. If Thailand imposes a tariff, what will the impact be on prices in the export-
                                              ing country?
                                             Solution:
                                             A tariff imposed by a small country would not change the price of comput-
                                             ers in the exporting country.

                                           3. How would a tariff affect consumer surplus, producer surplus, and govern-
                                              ment revenue in Thailand?
                                             Solution:
                                             When a small country imposes a tariff, it reduces consumer surplus,
                                             increases producer surplus, and increases government revenue in that
                                             country.

   4. Explain whether the net welfare effect of a tariff is the same as that of a
      quota.
      Solution:
      The quota can lead to a greater welfare loss than a tariff if the quota rents are
      captured by the foreign government or foreign firms.

   5. Which policy, a tariff or a quota, would be most beneficial to the local im-
      porter in which you may invest and why?
      Solution:
      A tariff will hurt importers because it will reduce their share of the comput-
      er market in Thailand. The impact of a quota depends on whether or not the
      importers can capture a share of the quota rents. Assuming importers can
      capture at least part of the rents, they will be better off with a quota.

   6. If Thailand were to negotiate a VER with the countries from which it im-
      ports computers, would this be better or worse than an import quota for the
      local importing firm in which you may invest? Why?
      Solution:
      The VER would not be better for the local importer than the import quota
      and would most likely be worse. Under the VER, all of the quota rents will
      be captured by the exporting countries whereas with an import quota at
      least part of the quota rents may be captured by local importers.

    It is important to understand existing trade policies and the potential for policy
changes that may affect return on investment. Changes in the government’s trade
policy can affect the pattern and value of trade and may result in changes in indus-
try structure. These changes may have important implications for firm profitability
and growth because they can affect the goods a firm can import or export; change
demand for its products; affect its pricing policies; and create delays through increased
paperwork, procurement of licenses, approvals, and so on. For example, changes in
import policies that affect the ability of a firm to import vital inputs for production

                                                                                            4
              explain motivations for and advantages of trading blocs, common
              markets, and economic unions

There has been a proliferation of trading blocs or regional trading agreements (RTA)
in recent years. Important examples of regional integration include the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the European Union (EU). A regional
trading bloc is a group of countries that have signed an agreement to reduce and pro-
gressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among
the members of the bloc. It may or may not have common trade barriers against
countries that are not members of the bloc.

                          Types Of Trading Blocs
                          There are many different types of regional trading blocs, depending on the level of
                          integration that takes place. Free trade areas (FTA) are one of the most prevalent
                          forms of regional integration in which all barriers to the flow of goods and services
                          among members have been eliminated. However, each country maintains its own
                          polices against non-members. The USMCA among the United States, Canada, and
                          Mexico is an example of an FTA. A customs union extends the FTA by not only
                          allowing free movement of goods and services among members but also by creating
                          a common trade policy against non-members. In 1947, Belgium, the Netherlands,
                          and Luxemburg (Benelux) formed a customs union that became part of the European
                          Community in 1958.
                               The common market is the next level of economic integration that incorporates
                          all aspects of the customs union and extends it by allowing free movement of factors
                          of production among members. The Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)
                          of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay is an example of a common market. An
                          economic union requires an even greater degree of integration. It incorporates all
                          aspects of a common market and in addition requires common economic institutions
                          and coordination of economic policies among members. The European Community
                          became the European Union in 1993. If the members of the economic union decide
                          to adopt a common currency, then it is also a monetary union. For example, with
                          the adoption of the euro, 19 EU member countries also formed a monetary union.

                             Trading Blocs

                             1. Chile and Australia have a free trade with each other but have separate trade
                                barriers on imports from other countries. Chile and Australia are a part of
                                a(n):
                                A. FTA.
                                B. economic union.
                                C. customs union.
                                 D. common market.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. Chile and Australia do not a have customs union because they
                                do not have a common trade policy with respect to other trade partners (C
                                is incorrect). A common market or an economic union entail even more
                                integration (B and D are incorrect).

                             2. An RTA that removes all tariffs on imports from member countries, and
                                has common external tariffs against all non-members, but does not advance
                                further in deepening economic integration is called a(n):
                                A. FTA.
                                B. economic union.
                                C. customs union.

       D. common market.
      Solution:
      C is correct. A basic FTA does not entail common external tariffs (A is in-
      correct), whereas a common market and an economic union entail integra-
      tion beyond common external tariffs (B and D are incorrect).



Regional Integration
Regional integration is popular because eliminating trade and investment barriers
among a small group of countries is easier, politically less contentious, and quicker
than multilateral trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The WTO is a negotiating forum that deals with the rules of global trade between
nations and where member countries can sort out trade disputes. Trade negotiations
launched by the WTO have included contentious issues of specific concern to devel-
oping countries, such as the cost of implementing trade policy reform in developing
countries, market access in developed countries for developing countries’ agricultural
products, and access to affordable pharmaceuticals in developing countries. Despite
decades of negotiations, limited progress has been made on these and other major
issues. Hence, it is not surprising to see a renewed interest in bilateral and multilateral
trade liberalization on a smaller scale. Policy coordination and harmonization are also
easier among a smaller group of countries. Regional integration can be viewed as a
movement toward freer trade.
    Regional integration results in preferential treatment for members compared with
non-members and can lead to changes in the patterns of trade. Member countries
move toward freer trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers against each other,
leading to a more efficient allocation of resources. Regional integration also may result
in trade and production being shifted from a lower-cost non-member who still faces
trade barriers to a higher-cost member who faces no trade barriers. This shift leads
to a less-efficient allocation of resources and could reduce welfare. Hence, two static
effects are direct results of the formation of the customs union: trade creation and
trade diversion.

Trade Creation and Diversion
Trade creation occurs when regional integration results in the replacement of
higher-cost domestic production by lower-cost imports from other members. For
example, consider two hypothetical countries, Qualor and Vulcan. Qualor produces
10 million shirts annually and imports 2 million shirts from Vulcan, which has a lower
cost of production. Qualor has 10 percent tariffs on imports from Vulcan. Qualor and
Vulcan then agree to form a customs union. Qualor reduces its production of shirts
to 7 million and now imports 11 million shirts from Vulcan. The decline in Qualor’s
domestic production (from 10 million to 7 million shirts) is replaced by importing
3 million additional shirts from the low-cost producer, Vulcan. This scenario rep-
resents trade creation. The rest of the additional imports (6 million shirts) represents
increased consumption by Qualor’s consumers because the price of shirts declines
after formation of the custom union.
    Trade diversion occurs when lower-cost imports from non-member countries
are replaced with higher-cost imports from members. In the previous example, sup-
pose Qualor initially imposes a 10 percent tariff on imports from both Vulcan and
Aurelia. Aurelia is the lowest-cost producer of shirts, so Qualor initially imports 2
million shirts from Aurelia instead of from Vulcan. Qualor and Vulcan then form a
customs union, which eliminates tariffs on imports from Vulcan but maintains a 10
percent tariff on imports from Aurelia. Now trade diversion could occur if the free
trade price on imports from Vulcan is lower than the price on imports from Aurelia.

                          Even though Aurelia is the lowest-cost producer, it may be a higher-priced source
                          of imports because of the tariff. If this is the case, then Qualor will stop importing
                          from Aurelia, a non-member, and divert its imports to Vulcan, a member of the RTA.
                          Both trade creation and trade diversion are possible in an RTA. If trade creation is
                          larger than trade diversion, then the net welfare effect is positive. There are concerns,
                          however, that this may not always be the case.

                          Costs and Benefits of Regional Trading Blocs
                          The benefits ascribed to free trade—greater specialization according to comparative
                          advantage, reduction in monopoly power because of foreign competition, economies
                          of scale from larger market size, learning by doing, technology transfer, knowledge
                          spillovers, greater foreign investment, and better quality intermediate inputs at world
                          prices—also apply to regional trading blocs. In addition, fostering greater interdepen-
                          dence among members of the regional trading bloc reduces the potential for conflict.
                          Members of the bloc also have greater bargaining power and political clout in the
                          global economy by acting together instead of as individual countries.
                              Considerable spillover of growth across borders is evident among member countries
                          of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which
                          are highly integrated both as a group and within their own geographic regions. The
                          long-run growth of integrated countries is interconnected because members have
                          greater access to each other’s markets. Strong growth in any RTA country could have
                          a positive impact on growth in other RTA member countries. RTAs also enhance the
                          benefits of good policy and lead to convergence in living standards. For example,
                          growth spillovers are likely to be much smaller among Sub-Saharan African countries
                          because of a lack of integration arising from deficiencies in RTAs and inadequate levels
                          of transportation and telecommunications infrastructure. One study estimated what the
                          cumulative loss in real GDP between 1970 and 2000 would have been if Switzerland,
                          which is landlocked and fully integrated with both its immediate neighbors and the
                          world economy, had been subject to the same level of spillovers as the Central African
                          Republic. Under such a scenario, Switzerland’s GDP per capita in 2000 would have
                          been 9.3 percent lower. The cumulative GDP loss would have been USD334 billion
                          (constant US dollars, 2000), which was the equivalent of 162 percent of Switzerland’s
                          real GDP in 2000.
                              Although regional integration has many advantages, it may impose costs on some
                          groups. For example, there was significant concern in the United States that fewer trade
                          restrictions and especially low-skilled labor-intensive imports from Mexico could hurt
                          low-skilled workers. Adjustment costs arose as import competition caused inefficient
                          firms to exit the market, and the workers in those firms were at least temporarily
                          unemployed as they sought new jobs. However, the surviving firms experienced an
                          increase in productivity, and US consumers benefited from the increase in product
                          varieties imported from Mexico. One study estimated that the product varieties
                          exported from Mexico to the United States had grown by an average of 2.2 percent a
                          year across all industries. While USMCA imposed estimated private costs of nearly
                          USD5.4 billion a year in the United States during 1994–2002, these costs were offset
                          by an average welfare gain of USD5.5 billion a year accruing from increased varieties
                          imported from Mexico. Consumer gains from more varieties of products continued
                          over time as long as the imports continued, whereas adjustment costs arising from
                          job losses declined over time. In 2003, the gain from increased product varieties from
                          Mexico was USD11 billion, far exceeding the adjustment costs of USD5.4 billion.
                              It is important to recognize, however, that workers displaced by regional integration
                          may have to bear long-term losses if they are unable to find jobs with wages compa-
                          rable with the jobs they lost or they remain unemployed for a long period of time.
                          For example, although import competition was certainly not the only factor that led

to a dramatic contraction of the US automobile industry, the impact on employment
in that industry is likely to be permanent and many former autoworkers, especially
older workers, may never find comparable jobs.
    Concerns regarding national sovereignty, especially where big and small nations
may be part of the same bloc, also have been an impediment to the formation of FTAs.
The proposal for a South Asian regional bloc has faced challenges regarding India’s
role because it is one of the biggest economies in the region.

Challenges to Deeper Integration
The formation of an RTA and its potential progression from an FTA to deeper integra-
tion in the form of a customs union, common market, or economic union face at least
two challenges. First, cultural differences and historical considerations—for example,
wars and conflicts—may complicate the social and political process of integration.
Second, maintaining a high degree of economic integration limits the extent to which
member countries can pursue independent economic and social policies. Free trade
and mobility of labor and capital tend to thwart policies aimed at controlling relative
prices or quantities within a country, while balance-of-payments and fiscal credibility
considerations limit the viability of divergent macroeconomic policies. This situation
is especially true in the case of a monetary union because monetary policy is not
under the control of individual countries and currency devaluation or revaluation is
not available as a tool to correct persistent imbalances. When persistent imbalances
do arise, they may lead to a crisis that spills over to other countries facing similar
problems. The Greek fiscal crisis in 2010 is a case in point. In May 2010, Standard &
Poor’s reduced the credit ratings on Greece’s government from investment grade to
junk status. It also downgraded the government debt of Spain and Portugal. These
countries were suffering from a combination of high government deficits and slow
GDP growth. The credit downgrades increased fears that Greece, in particular, would
default on its debt and cause economic turmoil not only among the healthier coun-
tries in the EU but also in the United States and Asia. The EU and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on a USD145 billion (EUR110 billion) bailout for Greece
in May 2010 and provided Ireland with a financing package of about USD113 billion
(EUR85 billion) in November 2010.

Investment Implications
Regional integration is important from an investment perspective because it offers
new opportunities for trade and investment. The cost of doing business in a large,
single, regional market is lower and firms can benefit from economies of scale. Note,
however, that differences in tastes, culture, and competitive conditions still exist
among members of a trading bloc. These differences may limit the potential benefits
from investments within the bloc. In addition, depending on the level of integration
and the safeguards in place, problems faced by individual member countries in an
RTA may quickly spread to other countries in the bloc.

                             1. Does an FTA make exporting firms in member countries more attractive as
                                investment options?
                                Solution:
                                The first stage, where there is free movement of goods and services among
                                RTA members, is called an FTA. It makes exporting firms a more attractive
                                investment proposition because they are able to serve markets in member
                                countries without the additional costs imposed by trade barriers.

                             2. How does the common market affect firms doing business in these countries
                                compared with an FTA?
                                Solution:
                                Unlike an FTA, a common market allows for free movement of factors of
                                production, such as labor and capital, among the member economies. Like
                                an FTA, it provides access to a much larger market and free movement of
                                goods and services. But the common market can create more profitable op-
                                portunities for firms than an FTA by allowing them to locate production in
                                and purchase components from anywhere in the common market according
                                to comparative advantage.

   SOLUTIONS
1. A is correct. Countries gain from exchange when trade enables each country
   to receive a higher price for exported goods or pay a lower price for imported
   goods. This leads to more efficient resource allocation and allows consumption of
   a larger variety of goods.

2. B is correct. Resources may need to be reallocated into or out of an industry, de-
   pending on whether that industry is an exporting sector or an import-competing
   sector of that economy. As a result of this adjustment process, less-efficient
   companies may be forced to exit the industry, which in turn may lead to higher
   unemployment and the need for retraining so that displaced workers may find
   jobs in expanding industries.

3. A is correct. The copper industry in Copperland would benefit from trade. Be-
   cause the cost of producing copper relative to producing tea is lower in Cop-
   perland than in Tealand, Copperland will export copper and the industry will
   expand.

4. A is correct. The imposition of a tariff will most likely increase domestic govern-
   ment revenue. A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the importing country’s
   government.

5. C is correct. With a voluntary export restraint, the price increase induced by re-
   stricting the quantity of imports (= quota rent for equivalent quota = tariff reve-
   nue for equivalent tariff ) accrues to foreign exporters or the foreign government.

6. A is correct. By definition, a large country is big enough to affect the world price
   of its imports and exports. A large country can benefit by imposing a tariff if its
   terms of trade improve by enough to outweigh the welfare loss arising from inef-
   ficient allocation of resources.

7. A is correct. A customs union extends an FTA by not only allowing free move-
   ment of goods and services among members, but also by creating common
   trade policy against non-members. Unlike a more integrated common market,
   a customs union does not allow free movement of factors of production among
   members.

8. C is correct. Regional trading agreements are politically less contentious and
   quicker to establish than multilateral trade negotiations (e.g., under the World
   Trade Organization). Policy coordination and harmonization is easier among a
   smaller group of countries.

itates international trade and capital flows. Numerous participants use this market
for a wide variety of financial, business, trade, and hedging purposes. As with any
trading market, the foreign exchange market uses various terms and conventions that
allow participants to understand quoting mechanisms and the factors affecting pricing
and then to conduct trades. International capital flows are the primary determinant
of short- to medium-term exchange rate movements, and exchange rate movements
affect the trade balance between countries. Given the relative economic stability and
objectives of different national governments, countries use a range of exchange rate
regimes, which are described in this module. These lessons introduce and expand
upon these topics to lay the groundwork for a more detailed understanding of the
foreign exchange market.

                          Introduction and the Foreign Exchange Market
                          The foreign exchange (FX) market—the market in which currencies are traded against
                          each other—is by far the world’s largest market. Current estimates put daily turnover
                          at approximately USD6.6 trillion for 2019. This is about 10 to 15 times larger than
                          daily turnover in global fixed-income markets and about 50 times larger than global
                          turnover in equities.
                              The FX market is a truly global market that operates 24 hours a day, each business
                          day. It involves market participants from every time zone connected through electronic
                          communications networks that link players as large as multibillion-dollar investment
                          funds and as small as individuals trading for their own account—all brought together
                          in real time. International trade would be impossible without the trade in currencies
                          that facilitates it and so too would cross-border capital flows that connect all financial
                          markets globally through the FX market.
                              These factors make FX a key market for investors and market participants to
                          understand. The world economy is increasingly transnational in nature, with both
                          production processes and trade flows often determined more by global factors than
                          by domestic considerations. Likewise, investment portfolio performance increasingly
                          reflects global determinants because pricing in financial markets responds to the array
                          of investment opportunities available worldwide, not just locally. All of these factors

funnel through, and are reflected in, the FX market. As investors shed their “home bias”
and invest in FX, the exchange rate—the price at which foreign-currency-denominated
investments are valued in terms of the domestic currency—becomes an increasingly
important determinant of portfolio performance.
    Even investors adhering to a purely “domestic” portfolio mandate are increasingly
affected by what happens in the FX market. Given the globalization of the world econ-
omy, most large companies depend heavily on their foreign operations (e.g., by some
estimates about 30 percent of S&P 500 Index earnings are from outside the United
States). Almost all companies are exposed to some degree of foreign competition, and
the pricing for domestic assets—equities, bonds, real estate, and others—also depend
on demand from foreign investors. All of these various influences on investment
performance reflect developments in the FX market.

The FX Market
To understand the FX market, it is necessary to become familiar with some of its basic
conventions. Individual currencies often are referred to by standardized three-letter
codes that the market has agreed upon through the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO). Exhibit 1 lists some of the major global currencies and their
identification codes.

It is important to understand the difference between referring to an individual currency
and an exchange rate. One can hold an individual currency (e.g., in a EUR100 million
deposit); an exchange rate, however, is the price of one currency in terms of another
(e.g., the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar). An individual currency
can be singular, but two currencies always are involved in an exchange rate: the price
of one currency relative to another. The exchange rate is the number of units of one

                          currency (called the price currency) that one unit of another currency (called the base
                          currency) will buy. An equivalent way of describing the exchange rate is as the cost of
                          one unit of the base currency in terms of the price currency.
                              This distinction between individual currencies and exchange rates is important
                          because, as we will see in a later lesson, these three-letter currency codes can be used
                          both ways. For example, when used as an exchange rate in the professional FX market,
                          EUR is understood to be the exchange rate between the euro and US dollar. Be aware
                          of the context (either as a currency or as an exchange rate) in which these three-letter
                          currency codes are being used. To avoid confusion, this lesson will identify exchange
                          rates using the convention of “A/B,” referring to the number of units of currency A
                          that one unit of currency B will buy. For example, a USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.1700
                          means that 1 euro will buy 1.1700 US dollars (i.e., 1 euro costs 1.1700 US dollars).
                          In this case, the euro is the base currency and the US dollar is the price currency. A
                          decrease in this exchange rate would mean that the euro costs less or that fewer US
                          dollars are needed to buy one euro. In other words, a decline in this exchange rate
                          indicates that the US dollar is appreciating against the euro or, equivalently, the euro
                          is depreciating against the US dollar.
                              These exchange rates are referred to as nominal exchange rates. In contrast, real
                          exchange rates are indexes that often are constructed by economists and other market
                          analysts to assess changes in the relative purchasing power of one currency compared
                          with another. Creating these indexes requires adjusting the nominal exchange rate
                          by using the price levels in each country of the currency pair (hence the name “real
                          exchange rates”) to compare the relative purchasing power between countries.
                              In a world of homogenous goods and services, and with no market frictions or trade
                          barriers, the relative purchasing power across countries would tend to equalize: Why
                          would you pay more, in real terms, domestically for a “widget” if you could import an
                          identical “widget” from overseas at a cheaper price? This basic concept is the intu-
                          ition behind a theory known as purchasing power parity (PPP), which describes the
                          long-term equilibrium of nominal exchange rates. PPP asserts that nominal exchange
                          rates adjust so that identical goods (or baskets of goods) will have the same price in
                          different markets. Or, put differently, the purchasing power of different currencies is
                          equalized for a standardized basket of goods.
                              In practice, the conditions required to enforce PPP are not satisfied: Goods and
                          services are not identical across countries; countries typically have different baskets
                          of goods and services produced and consumed; many goods and services are not
                          traded internationally; there are trade barriers and transaction costs (e.g., shipping
                          costs and import taxes); and capital flows are at least as important as trade flows in
                          determining nominal exchange rates. As a result, nominal exchange rates exhibit
                          persistent deviations from PPP. Moreover, relative purchasing power among countries
                          displays a weak, if any, tendency toward long-term equalization. A simple example
                          of a cross-country comparison of the purchasing power of a standardized good is
                          the Big Mac index produced by the Economist, which shows the relative price of
                          this standardized hamburger in different countries. The Big Mac index shows that
                          fast-food hamburger prices can vary widely internationally and that this difference
                          in purchasing power is typical of most goods and services. Hence, movements in real
                          exchange rates provide meaningful information about changes in relative purchasing
                          power among countries.
                              Consider the case of an individual who wants to purchase goods from a foreign
                          country. The individual would be able to buy fewer of these goods if the nominal
                          spot exchange rate for the foreign currency appreciated or if the foreign price level
                          increased. Conversely, the individual could buy more foreign goods if the individual’s
                          domestic income increased. (For this example, we will assume that changes in the
                          individual’s income are proportional to changes in the domestic price level.) Hence,
                          in real purchasing power terms, the real exchange rate that an individual faces is an

increasing function of the nominal exchange rate (quoted in terms of the number of
units of domestic currency per one unit of foreign currency) and the foreign price level
and a decreasing function of the domestic price level. The higher the real exchange rate
is, the fewer foreign goods, in real terms, the individual can purchase and the lower
that individual’s relative purchasing power will be compared with the other country.
     An equivalent way of viewing the real exchange rate is that it represents the relative
price levels in the domestic and foreign countries. Mathematically, we can represent
the foreign price level in terms of the domestic currency as follows:
   Foreign price level in domestic currency = Sd/f × Pf,
    where Sd/f is the spot exchange rate (quoted in terms of the number of units of
domestic currency per one unit of foreign currency) and Pf is foreign price level quoted
in terms of the foreign currency. We can define the domestic price level, in terms of
the domestic currency, as Pd. Hence, the ratio between the foreign and domestic price
levels is as follows:
   Real exchange rate(d/f) = (Sd/fPf)/Pd = Sd/f × (Pf/Pd) .
For example, for a British consumer wanting to buy goods made in the Eurozone, the
real exchange rate (defined in GBP/EUR terms; note that the domestic currency for
the United Kingdom is the price currency, not the base currency) will be an increasing
function of the nominal spot exchange rate (GBP/EUR) and the Eurozone price level
and a decreasing function of the UK price level. This is written as follows:

                                 EUR             EUR       UK

We can examine the effect of movements in the domestic and foreign price levels, and
the nominal spot exchange rate, on the real purchasing power of an individual in the
United Kingdom wanting to purchase Eurozone goods. Assume that the nominal spot
exchange rate (GBP/EUR) increases by 10 percent, the Eurozone price level increases
by 5 percent, and the UK price level increases by 2 percent. The change in the real
exchange rate is then as follows:

                          ​(1 + _
                                ​ ​P​​ )
                                  ​ f​​
                                 ΔP


     (         ​f ​ )
          Δ ​S​_d ​                     ​ ​
          _​f ​          _           f
   	​ 1 + ​ ​S​_d ​ ​ ​× ​         ​ d​ ​ ​− 1
                         ​(1 + _
                               ​ ​P​ ​ )
                               ΔP
                                        ​​
                                   d
                           1 + 5%
   = ​(1 + 10%)​× _
                  ​1 + 2% ​− 1 ≈ 10 % + 5 %   − 2 %   ≈ 13%​.


In this case, the real exchange rate for the UK-based individual has increased about 13
percent, meaning that it now costs more, in real terms, to buy Eurozone goods. Or put
differently, the UK individual’s real purchasing power relative to Eurozone goods has
declined by about 13 percent. An easy way to remember this relationship is to consider
the real exchange rate (stated with the domestic currency as the price currency) as
representing the real price you face to purchase foreign goods and services: The higher
the price is (real exchange rate), the lower your relative purchasing power will be.
    The real exchange rate for a currency can be constructed for the domestic currency
relative to a single foreign currency or relative to a basket of foreign currencies. In
either case, these real exchange rate indexes depend on the assumptions made by the
analyst creating them. Several investment banks and central banks create proprietary
measures of real exchange rates. Note that real exchange rates are not quoted or traded
in global FX markets: They are only indexes created by analysts to understand the inter-
national competitiveness of an economy and the real purchasing power of a currency.
    In this context, real exchange rates can be useful for understanding trends in
international trade and capital flows and hence can be seen as one of the influences
on nominal spot exchange rates. As an example, consider the exchange rate between

                          the Indian rupee and the US dollar. During 2018, the nominal rupee exchange rate
                          against the US dollar (INR/USD) rose by approximately 6.7 percent—meaning that
                          the US dollar appreciated against the rupee. However, the annual inflation rates in the
                          United States and India were different during 2018—approximately 2.5 percent for the
                          United States and 4.7 percent for India. This means that the real exchange rate (in INR/
                          USD terms) was depreciating less rapidly than the nominal INR/USD exchange rate:
                                                          (​ 1 + %Δ P

                                                                             ​− 1 ≈ + 6.7 %   + 2.5 %   − 4.7 %   ≈ 4.5%​.

                          This combination of a much weaker rupee and a higher Indian inflation rate meant
                          that the real exchange rate faced by India was increasing, thus decreasing Indian
                          purchasing power in US dollar terms.
                               Movements in real exchange rates can have a similar effect as movements in nom-
                          inal exchange rates in terms of affecting relative prices and hence trade flows. Even if
                          the nominal spot exchange rate does not move, differences in inflation rates between
                          countries affect their relative competitiveness.
                               Although real exchange rates can exert some influence on nominal exchange rate
                          movements, they are only one of many factors; it can be difficult to disentangle all
                          of these inter-relationships in a complex and dynamic FX market. As discussed ear-
                          lier, PPP is a poor guide to predicting future movements in nominal exchange rates
                          because these rates can deviate from PPP equilibrium—and even continue to trend
                          away from their PPP level—for years at a time. Hence, it should not be surprising that
                          real exchange rates, which reflect changes in relative purchasing power, have a poor
                          track record as a predictor of future nominal exchange rate movements.

                           EXAMPLE 1

                             Nominal and Real Exchange Rates
                             An investment adviser located in Sydney, Australia, is meeting with a local client
                             who is looking to diversify her domestic bond portfolio by adding investments
                             in fixed-rate, long-term bonds denominated in the Hong Kong dollar. The
                             client frequently visits Hong Kong SAR, and many of her annual expenses are
                             denominated in the Hong Kong dollar. The client, however, is concerned about
                             the foreign currency risks of offshore investments and whether the investment
                             return on her Hong Kong-dollar-denominated investments will maintain her
                             purchasing power—both domestically (i.e., for her Australian-dollar-denominated
                             expenses) and for her foreign trips (i.e., Hong Kong-dollar-denominated expenses
                             for her visits to Hong Kong SAR). The investment adviser explains the effect
                             of changes in nominal and real exchange rates to the client and illustrates this
                             explanation by making the following statements:

                               Statement 1        All else equal, an increase in the nominal AUD/HKD exchange
                                                  rate will lead to an increase in the Australia-dollar-denominated
                                                  value of your foreign investment.
                               Statement 2        All else equal, an increase in the nominal AUD/HKD exchange
                                                  rate means that your relative purchasing power for your Hong
                                                  Kong SAR trips will increase (based on paying for your trip with
                                                  the income from your Hong Kong-dollar-denominated bonds).
                               Statement 3        All else equal, an increase in the Australian inflation rate will
                                                  lead to an increase in the real exchange rate (AUD/HKD). A
                                                  higher real exchange rate means that the relative purchasing
                                                  power of your Australian-dollar-denominated income is higher.

    Statement 4    All else equal, a decrease in the nominal exchange rate (AUD/
                   HKD) will decrease the real exchange rate (AUD/HKD) and
                   increase the relative purchasing power of your Australian-
                   dollar-denominated income.
      To demonstrate the effects of the changes in inflation and nominal exchange
  rates on relative purchasing power, the adviser uses the following scenario:
  “Suppose that the AUD/HKD exchange rate increases by 5 percent, the price
  of goods and services in Hong Kong SAR goes up by 5 percent, and the price of
  Australian goods and services goes up by 2 percent.”

  1. Statement 1 is:
      A. correct.
      B. incorrect, because based on the quote convention the investment’s
         value would be decreasing in Australian dollar terms.
      C. incorrect, because the nominal Australian dollar value of the foreign
         investments will depend on movements in the Australian inflation
         rate.
     Solution:
     A is correct. Given the quoting convention, an increase in the AUD/HKD
     rate means that the base currency (Hong Kong dollar) is appreciating (one
     Hong Kong dollar will buy more Australian dollars). This increases the
     nominal value of the Hong Kong-dollar-denominated investments when
     measured in Australian dollar terms.

  2. Statement 2 is:
      A. correct.
      B. incorrect, because purchasing power is not affected in this case.
      C. incorrect, because based on the quote convention, the client’s relative
         purchasing power would be decreasing.
     Solution:
     B is correct. When paying for Hong Kong-dollar-denominated expenses
     with Hong Kong-dollar-denominated income, the value of the AUD/HKD
     spot exchange rate (or any other spot exchange rate) would not be relevant.
     In fact, this is a basic principle of currency risk management: reducing FX
     risk exposures by denominating assets and liabilities (or income and expens-
     es) in the same currency.

  3. Statement 3 is:
      A. correct.
      B. incorrect with respect to the real exchange rate only.
      C. incorrect with respect to both the real exchange rate and the purchas-
         ing power of Australian dollar -denominated income.
     Solution:
     C is correct. An increase in the Australian (i.e., domestic) inflation rate
     means that the real exchange rate (measured in domestic/foreign, or AUD/
     HKD, terms) would be decreasing, not increasing. Moreover, an increase in
     the real exchange rate (R AUD/HKD) would be equivalent to a reduction of the
     purchasing power of the Australian client: Goods and services denominated
     in Hong Kong dollar would cost more.

                             4. Statement 4 is:
                                 A. correct.
                                 B. incorrect with respect to the real exchange rate.
                                 C. incorrect with respect to the purchasing power of Australian dol-
                                    lar-denominated income.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. As the spot AUD/HKD exchange rate decreases, the Hong
                                Kong dollar is depreciating against the Australian dollar; or equivalently,
                                the Australian dollar is appreciating against the Hong Kong dollar. This is
                                reducing the real exchange rate (R AUD/HKD) and increasing the Australian
                                client’s purchasing power.

                             5. Based on the adviser’s scenario and assuming that the Hong Kong dollar
                                value of the Hong Kong dollar bonds remained unchanged, the nominal
                                Australian dollar value of the client’s Hong Kong dollar investments would:
                                 A. decrease by about 5 percent.
                                 B. increase by about 5 percent.
                                 C. remain about the same.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. As the AUD/HKD spot exchange rate increases by 5 percent,
                                the Hong Kong dollar is appreciating against the Australian dollar by 5
                                percent and, all else equal, the value of the Hong Kong-dollar-denominated
                                investment is increasing by 5 percent in Australian dollar terms.

                             6. Based on the adviser’s scenario, the change in the relative purchasing power
                                of the client’s Australian-dollar-denominated income is closest to:
                                 A. –8 percent.
                                 B. +8 percent.
                                 C. +12 percent.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The real exchange rate (R AUD/HKD) is expressed as follows:
                                                      ​P​

                                                AUD ​× ​

                                   HKD         HKD      AUD

                                The information in the adviser’s scenario can be expressed as follows:
                                         AUD ​ ≈ %Δ ​S​_
                                 	​%Δ ​R​_
                                         ​   ​
                                                       AUD ​+ %Δ ​P​
                                                       ​   ​       HKD​− %Δ ​PAUD
                                                                              ​ ​ ≈ + 5 %   + 5 %   − 2 %   ≈ + 8%​.
                                         HKD            HKD

                                Because the real exchange rate (expressed in AUD/HKD terms) has gone up
                                by about 8 percent, the real purchasing power of the investor based in Aus-
                                tralia has declined by about 8 percent. This can be seen from the fact that
                                Hong Kong dollar has appreciated against the Australian dollar in nominal
                                terms, and the Hong Kong SAR price level has also increased. This increase
                                in the cost of Hong Kong SAR goods and services (measured in Australian
                                dollars) is only partially offset by the small (2 percent) increase in the inves-
                                tor’s income (assumed equal to the change in the Australian price level).

QUESTION SET


  1. A decrease in the real exchange rate (quoted in terms of domestic
     currency per unit of foreign currency) is most likely to be associated with an
     increase in which of the following?
       A. Foreign price level.
       B. Domestic price level.
        C. Nominal exchange rate.
       Solution:
       B is correct. The real exchange rate (quoted in terms of domestic currency
       per unit of foreign currency) is given as follows:
       Real exchange rate(d/f) = Sd/f × (Pf/Pd).
       An increase in the domestic price level (Pd) decreases the real exchange
       rate because it implies an increase in the relative purchasing power of the
       domestic currency.



Market Participants
We now turn to the counterparties that participate in FX markets. As mentioned
previously, an extremely diverse universe of market participants ranges in size from
multi-billion-dollar investment funds to individuals trading for their own account
(including foreign tourists exchanging currencies at airport kiosks).
    To understand the various market participants, it is useful to separate them into
broad categories. One broad distinction is between what the market refers to as the buy
side and the sell side. The sell side generally consists of large FX trading banks (such
as Citigroup, UBS, and Deutsche Bank); the buy side consists of clients who use these
banks to undertake FX transactions (i.e., buy FX products) from the sell-side banks.
    The buy side can be further broken down into several categories:
   ■    Corporate accounts: Corporations of all sizes undertake FX transactions
        during cross-border purchases and sales of goods and services. Many of
        their FX flows also are related to cross-border investment flows—such as
        international mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transactions, investment of
        corporate funds in foreign assets, and foreign currency borrowing.
   ■    Real money accounts: These are investment funds managed by insurance
        companies, mutual funds, pension funds, endowments, exchange-traded
        funds (ETFs), and other institutional investors. These accounts are referred
        to as real money because they usually are restricted in their use of lever-
        age or financial derivatives. This feature distinguishes them from leveraged
        accounts (discussed next), although many institutional investors often
        engage in some form of leverage, either directly through some use of bor-
        rowed funds or indirectly using financial derivatives.
   ■    Leveraged accounts: This category, often referred to as the professional trad-
        ing community, consists of hedge funds, proprietary trading shops, com-
        modity trading advisers (CTAs), high-frequency algorithmic traders, and the
        proprietary trading desks at banks—and, indeed, almost any active trad-
        ing account that accepts and manages FX risk for profit. The professional
        trading community accounts for a large and growing proportion of daily FX
        market turnover. These active trading accounts also have a wide diversity of

                                  trading styles. Some are macro-hedge funds that take long-term FX posi-
                                  tions based on their views of the underlying economic fundamentals of a
                                  currency. Others are high-frequency algorithmic traders that use technical
                                  trading strategies (such as those based on moving averages or Fibonacci
                                  levels) and whose trading cycles and investment horizons are sometimes
                                  measured in milliseconds.
                              ■   Retail accounts: The simplest example of a retail account is the archetypical
                                  foreign tourist exchanging currency at an airport kiosk. However, as elec-
                                  tronic trading technology has reduced the barriers to entry into FX markets
                                  and the costs of FX trading, there has been a huge surge in speculative
                                  trading activity by retail accounts—consisting of individuals trading for their
                                  own accounts as well as smaller hedge funds and other active traders. This
                                  category also includes households using electronic trading technology to
                                  move their savings into foreign currencies (e.g., this is relatively widespread
                                  among households in Japan). It is estimated that retail trading accounts for
                                  as much as 10 percent of all spot transactions in some currency pairs and
                                  that this proportion is growing.
                              ■   Governments: Public entities of all types often have FX needs, ranging from
                                  relatively small (e.g., maintaining consulates in foreign countries) to large
                                  (e.g., military equipment purchases or maintaining overseas military bases).
                                  Sometimes these flows are purely transactional—the business simply needs
                                  to be done—and sometimes government FX flows reflect, at least in part,
                                  the public policy goals of the government. Some government FX business
                                  resembles that of investment funds, although sometimes with a public
                                  policy mandate as well. In some countries, public sector pension plans
                                  and public insurance schemes are run by a branch of the government. One
                                  example is the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, which was created
                                  by the Québec provincial government in Canada to manage that province’s
                                  public sector pension plans. The Caisse, as it is called, is a relatively large
                                  player in financial markets, with nearly CAD420 billion of assets under
                                  management at the end of 2021. Although it has a mandate to invest these
                                  assets for optimal return, it is also called upon to help promote the eco-
                                  nomic development of Québec. Many governments—both at the federal and
                                  provincial/state levels—issue debt in foreign currencies; this, too, creates
                                  FX flows. Such supranational agencies as the World Bank and the African
                                  Development Bank issue debt in a variety of currencies as well.
                              ■   Central banks: These entities sometimes intervene in FX markets to influ-
                                  ence either the level or trend in the domestic exchange rate. This often
                                  occurs when the central banks judge their domestic currency to be too
                                  weak and when the exchange rate has overshot any concept of equilibrium
                                  level (e.g., because of a speculative attack) to the degree that the exchange
                                  rate no longer reflects underlying economic fundamentals. Alternatively,
                                  central banks also intervene when the FX market has become so erratic and
                                  dysfunctional that end-users such as corporations can no longer transact
                                  necessary FX business. Conversely, central banks sometimes intervene when
                                  they believe that their domestic currency has become too strong, to the
                                  point that it undercuts that country’s export competitiveness. The Bank of
                                  Japan intervened against yen strength versus the US dollar in 2004 and again
                                  in March 2011 after the massive earthquake and nuclear disaster. Similarly,
                                  in 2010, 2013, and again in 2015, the Swiss National Bank intervened against
                                  strength in the Swiss franc versus the euro by selling the Swiss franc on
                                  the euro–Swiss (CHF/EUR) cross-rate. Central bank reserve managers are
                                  frequent participants in FX markets to manage their country’s FX reserves.

       In this context, they act much like real money investment funds—although
       generally with a cautious, conservative mandate to safeguard the value of
       their country’s FX reserves. The FX reserves of some countries are enor-
       mous, and central bank participation in FX markets can sometimes have a
       material impact on exchange rates even when these reserve managers are
       not intervening for public policy purposes. Total FX reserves reached nearly
       USD13 trillion at the end of 2021.
       This largely reflects the rapid growth in foreign reserves held by Asian
       central banks, because these countries typically run large current account
       surpluses with the United States and other developed market economies.
       Reserve accumulation by energy-exporting countries in the Middle East
       and elsewhere is also a factor. As of the end of 2021, nearly 60 percent of
       global allocated currency reserves were held in US dollars, while just over 20
       percent was held in euros, the second most widely held currency in central
       bank FX reserves.
   ■   Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs): Many countries with large current account
       surpluses have diverted some of the resultant international capital flows into
       SWFs rather than into FX reserves managed by central banks. Although
       SWFs are government entities, their mandate is usually more oriented
       toward purely investment purposes rather than public policy purposes. As
       such, SWFs can be thought of as akin to real money accounts, although
       some SWFs can employ derivatives or engage in aggressive trading strate-
       gies. It generally is understood that SWFs use their resources to help fulfill
       the public policy mandate of their government owners. The SWFs of many
       current account surplus countries (such as exporting countries in East Asia
       (e.g., Singapore) or oil-exporting countries (e.g., Kuwait) are enormous, and
       their FX flows can be an important determinant of exchange rate move-
       ments in almost all of the major currency pairs.
    The sell side generally consists of the FX dealing banks that sell FX products to
the buy side. The following sell-side distinctions can be made.
   ■   A large and growing proportion of the daily FX turnover is accounted for
       by the very largest money center dealing banks, such as Deutsche Bank,
       Citigroup, UBS, HSBC, and a few other multinational banking behemoths.
       Maintaining a competitive advantage in FX requires huge fixed-cost invest-
       ments in the electronic technology that connects the FX market, and it also
       requires a broad, global client base. As a result, only the largest first-tier
       banks are able to compete successfully in providing competitive price quotes
       to clients across the broad range of FX products. In fact, among the largest
       FX dealing banks, a large proportion of their business is crossed internally,
       meaning that these banks are able to connect buyers and sellers within their
       own extremely diverse client base and have no need to show these FX flows
       outside of the bank.
   ■   All other banks fall into the second and third tier of the FX market sell
       side. Many of these financial institutions are regional or local banks with
       well-developed business relationships, but they lack the economies of scale,
       broad global client base, or information technology (IT) expertise required
       to offer competitive pricing across a wide range of currencies and FX prod-
       ucts. In many cases, these are banks in emerging markets that do not have
       the business connections or credit lines required to access the FX market on
       a cost-effective basis on their own. As a result, these banks often outsource

                                 FX services by forming business relationships with the larger tier-one banks;
                                 otherwise, they depend on the deep, competitive liquidity provided by the
                                 largest FX market participants.
                              The categories presented are based on functions that are closely associated with
                          the named groups. However, in some cases, functions typifying a group also may be
                          assumed by or shared with another group. For example, sell-side banks provide FX price
                          quotes. Hedge funds and other large players, however, may access the professional FX
                          market on equal terms with the dealing banks and effectively act as market makers.
                              One of the most important ideas to draw from this categorization of market
                          participants is that there is an extremely wide variety of FX market participants,
                          reflecting a complex mix of trading motives and strategies that can vary with time.
                          Most market participants reflect a combination of hedging and speculative motives
                          in tailoring their FX risk exposures. Among public sector market participants, public
                          policy motives also may be a factor. The dynamic, complex interaction of FX market
                          participants and their trading objectives make it difficult to analyze or predict move-
                          ments in FX rates with any precision or to describe the FX market adequately with
                          simple characterizations.

                           BEST PRACTICES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

                             As an important element of trade and cross-border capital flows and a key
                             determinant of portfolio performance, the transparency and proper functioning
                             of foreign exchange markets is of critical importance to market participants in
                             meeting their financial goals and objectives. However, as a truly global market,
                             the FX market lacks the regulatory oversight of domestic exchanges, although
                             the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) mentioned earlier, oversees and
                             periodically surveys FX market activity worldwide.
                                 In an effort initiated by the BIS Markets Committee, the Global Foreign
                             Exchange Committee (GFXC) was established in 2017 by FX market partici-
                             pants, including central banks, large global banks, and buy-side firms, to ensure
                             a “robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent” FX market in which
                             users can transact at competitive prices using best practices established in a
                             voluntary FX Global Code. These practices address such principles as ethics,
                             governance, execution, information sharing, confirmation and settlement, and
                             risk management and compliance.



                          Market Composition
                          In this section, we first describe components of the FX market, then present a
                          descriptive overview of the global FX market drawn from the 2016 Triennial Survey
                          undertaken by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
                              In addition to spot transactions, the FX market includes forward transactions and
                          FX swaps. Forwards are transactions made using forward exchange rates with settle-
                          ment at agreed-upon future dates, and forward rates can be used to manage FX risk.
                          The combination of spot and forward transactions can be used to create FX swaps.
                          These instruments are used for hedging purposes and to raise foreign currency at more
                          favorable rates, and their trading constitutes the largest daily volume of the FX market.
                              The BIS is an umbrella organization for the world’s central banks. Every three
                          years, participating central banks undertake a survey of the FX market in their juris-
                          dictions, the results of which are aggregated and compiled at the BIS. The survey,
                          taken in April 2016, gives a broad indication of the current size and distribution of
                          global FX market flows.

    As of April 2016, the BIS estimates that average daily turnover in the traditional
FX market (composed of spot, outright forward, and FX swap transactions) totaled
approximately USD5.1 trillion. Exhibit 2 shows the approximate percentage allocation
among FX product types, including both traditional FX products and exchange-traded
FX derivatives. Note that this table of percentage allocations adds exchange-traded
derivatives to the BIS estimate of average daily turnover of USD5.1 trillion; the “Spot”
and “Outright forwards” categories include only transactions that are not executed
as part of a swap transaction.

The survey also provides a percentage breakdown of the average daily flows between
sell-side banks (called the interbank market), between banks and financial customers
(all non-bank financial entities, such as real money and leveraged accounts, SWFs, and
central banks), and between banks and non-financial customers (such as corporations,
retail accounts, and governments). The breakdown is provided in Exhibit 3. It bears
noting that the proportion of average daily FX flow accounted for by financial clients is
much larger than that for non-financial clients. The BIS also reports that the proportion
of financial client flows has been growing rapidly, and in 2010, it exceeded interbank
trading volume for the first time. This underscores the fact that only a minority of
the daily FX flow is accounted for by corporations and individuals buying and selling
foreign goods and services. Huge investment pools and professional traders account
for a large and growing proportion of the FX business.

                           EXAMPLE 2

                             Market Participants and Composition of Trades
                             The investment adviser based in Sydney, Australia, makes the following statements
                             to her client when describing some of the basic characteristics of the FX market:

                               Statement 1     “FX transactions for spot settlement see the most trade volume
                                               in terms of average daily turnover because the FX market is
                                               primarily focused on settling international trade flows.”
                               Statement 2     “The most important FX market participants on the buy side are
                                               corporations engaged in international trade; on the sell side they
                                               are the local banks that service their FX needs.”

                             1. Statement 1 is:
                                 A. correct.
                                 B. incorrect with respect to the importance of spot settlements.
                                 C. incorrect both with respect to the importance of spot settlements and
                                    international trade flows.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Although the media generally focus on the spot market when
                                discussing FX, the majority of average daily trade volume involves the FX
                                swap market as market participants either roll over or modify their exist-
                                ing hedging and speculative positions (or engage in FX swap financing).
                                Although it is true that all international trade transactions eventually result
                                in some form of spot settlement, this typically generates a great deal of
                                hedging (and speculative) activity in advance of spot settlement. Moreover,
                                an important group of FX market participants engages in purely specula-
                                tive positioning with no intention of ever delivering/receiving the principal
                                amount of the trades. Most FX trading volume is not related to international
                                trade: Portfolio flows (cross-border capital movements) and speculative
                                activities dominate.

                             2. Statement 2 is:
                                 A. correct.

      B. incorrect with respect to corporations engaged in international trade.
      C. incorrect with respect to both corporations and the local banks that
         service their trade needs.
     Solution:
     C is correct. The most important FX market participants in terms of average
     daily turnover are found not among corporations engaged in international
     trade but among huge investment managers, both private (e.g., pension
     funds) and public (e.g., central bank reserve managers or sovereign wealth
     funds). A large and growing amount of daily turnover is also being gener-
     ated by high-frequency traders who use computer algorithms to automati-
     cally execute extremely high numbers of speculative trades (although their
     individual ticket sizes are generally small, they add up to large aggregate
     flows). On the sell side, the largest money center banks (e.g., Deutsche Bank,
     Citigroup, HSBC, UBS) are increasingly dominating the amount of trading
     activity routed through dealers. Regional and local banks are increasingly
     being marginalized in terms of their share of average daily turnover in FX
     markets.



QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following counterparties is most likely to be consid-
     ered a sell-side FX market participant?
      A. A large corporation that borrows in foreign currencies
      B. A sovereign wealth fund that influences cross-border capital flows
      C. A multinational bank that trades FX with its diverse client base
     Solution:
     C is correct. The sell-side parties generally consist of large banks that sell
     FX and related instruments to buy-side clients. These banks act as market
     makers, quoting exchange rates at which they will buy (the bid price) or sell
     (the offer price) the base currency.



Exchange Rate Quotations
Exchange rates represent the relative price of one currency in terms of another. This
price can be represented in two ways: (1) currency A buys how many units of currency
B; or (2) currency B buys how many units of currency A. Of course, these two prices
are simply the inverse of each other.
    To distinguish between these two prices, market participants sometimes distinguish
between direct and indirect exchange rates. In the quoting convention A/B (where
there are a certain number of units of currency A per one unit of currency B), we
refer to currency A as the price currency (or quote currency); currency B is referred
to as the base currency. (The reason for this choice of names will become clear.) The
base currency is always set at a quantity of one. A direct currency quote takes the
domestic country as the price currency and the foreign country as the base currency.
For example, for a Paris-based trader, the domestic currency would be the euro (EUR)
and a foreign currency would be the UK pound (GBP). For this Paris-based trader,
a direct quote would be EUR/GBP. An exchange rate quote of EUR/GBP = 1.1211
means that GBP1 costs EUR1.1211. For this Paris-based trader, an indirect quote has

                          the domestic currency—the euro—as the base currency. An indirect quote of GBP/
                          EUR = 0.8920 means that EUR1 costs GBP0.8920. Direct and indirect quotes are just
                          the inverse (reciprocal) of each other.
                              The professional FX market does not use the convention of describing exchange
                          rates as either being direct or indirect because determining the domestic currency and
                          the foreign currency depends on where one is located. For a London-based market
                          participant, the UK pound (GBP) is the domestic currency and the euro (EUR) is a for-
                          eign currency. For a Paris-based market participant, it would be the other way around.
                              To avoid confusion, the FX market has developed a set of market conventions that
                          all market participants typically adhere to when making and asking for FX quotes.
                          Exhibit 5 displays some of these for the major currencies: the currency code used for
                          obtaining exchange rate quotes, how the market lingo refers to this currency pair, and
                          the actual ratio—price currency per unit of base currency—represented by the quote.

                          Several things should be noted in this exhibit. First, the three-letter currency codes
                          in the first column (for FX rate quotes) refer to what are considered to be the major
                          exchange rates. Remember that an exchange rate is the price of one currency in
                          terms of another: Two currencies are always involved in the price. This is different
                          from referring to a single currency in its own right. For example, one can refer to the
                          euro (EUR) as a currency; but if we refer to a euro exchange rate (EUR), it is always
                          the price of the euro in terms of another currency, in this case the US dollar. This is
                          because in the professional FX market, the three-letter code EUR is always taken to
                          refer to the euro–US dollar exchange rate, which is quoted in terms of the number
                          of US dollars per euro (USD/EUR). Second, the six-letter currency codes in the first
                          column refer to some of the major cross-rates. This topic will be covered in the next
                          section, but generally these are secondary exchange rates and are not as common
                          as the main exchange rates. (Note that three-letter codes are always in terms of an
                          exchange rate involving the US dollar, but the six-letter codes are not.) Third, when
                          both currencies are mentioned in the code or the name convention, the base currency
                          is always mentioned first, the opposite order of the actual ratio (price currency/base
                          currency). Thus, the code for “Sterling–yen” is “GBPJPY,” but the actual number quoted
                          is the number of yen per sterling (JPY/GBP). Note also that the codes may appear in

a variety of formats that all mean the same thing. For example, GBPJPY might instead
appear as GBP:JPY or GBP–JPY. Fourth, regardless of where a market participant is
located, there is always a mix of direct and indirect quotes in common market usage.
For example, a trader based in Toronto, Canada, will typically refer to the euro–Canada
and Canada–yen exchange rates—a mixture of direct (CAD/EUR) and indirect (JPY/
CAD) quotes for that Canada-based trader. No overall consistency is observed in this
mixture of direct and indirect quoting conventions in the professional FX market; a
market participant must get familiar with how the conventions are used. In general,
however, there is a hierarchy for quoting conventions. For quotes involving the euro, it
serves as the base currency (e.g., GBP/EUR). Next in the priority sequence, for quotes
involving the British pound (but not the euro), it serves as the base currency (e.g.,
USD/GBP). Finally, for quotes involving the US dollar (but not the GBP or EUR), it
serves as the base currency (e.g., CAD/USD). Exceptions among the major currencies
are the Australian and New Zealand dollars: they serve as the base currency when
quoted against the US dollars (i.e., USD/AUD, USD/NZD).
    Another concept involving exchange rate quotes in professional FX markets is that
of a two-sided price. When a client asks a bank for an exchange rate quote, the bank
will provide a “bid” (the price at which the bank is willing to buy the currency) and an
“offer” (the price at which the bank is willing to sell the currency). But two currencies
are referenced in an exchange rate quote, which is always the price of one currency
relative to the other. So, which currency is being bought and which is being sold in
this two-sided price quote? In this situation, the lingo involving the price currency
(or quote currency) and the base currency, explained earlier, becomes useful. The
two-sided price quoted by the dealer is in terms of buying/selling the base currency. It
shows the number of units of the price currency that the client will receive from the
dealer for one unit of the base currency (the bid) and the number of units of the price
currency that the client must sell to the dealer to obtain one unit of the base currency
(the offer). Consider the case of a client that is interested in a transaction involving
the Swiss franc (CHF) and the euro (EUR). As we have read, the market convention
is to quote this as euro–Swiss (CHF/EUR). The euro is the base currency, and the
two-sided quote (price) shows the number of units of the price currency (CHF) that
must be paid or will be received for EUR1. For example, a two-sided price in euro–
Swiss (CHF/EUR) might look like: 1.1583–1.1585. The client will receive CHF1.1583
for selling EUR1 to the dealer and must pay CHF1.1585 to the dealer to buy EUR1.
Note that the price is shown in terms of the price currency and that the bid is always
less than the offer: The bank buys the base currency (euro, in this case) at the low
price and sells the base currency at the high price. Buying low and selling high is
profitable for banks, and spreading clients—trying to widen the bid/offer spread—is
how dealers try to increase their profit margins. Note, however, that the electronic
dealing systems currently used in professional FX markets are extremely efficient in
connecting buyers and sellers globally. Moreover, this worldwide competition for
business has compressed most bid/offer spreads to very tight levels. For simplicity,
in the remainder of this reading, we will focus on exchange rates as a single number
(with no bid/offer spread).
    One last point in exchange rate quoting conventions is that most major spot
exchange rates are typically quoted to four decimal places. One exception among the
major currencies involves the yen, for which spot exchange rates are usually quoted
to two decimal places. (For example, a USD/EUR quote would be expressed as 1.1701,
whereas a JPY/EUR quote would be expressed as 130.98.) This difference involving the
yen comes from the fact that the units of yen per unit of other currencies typically is
relatively large, and hence extending the exchange rate quote to four decimal places
is viewed as unnecessary.

                               Regardless of which quoting convention is used, changes in an exchange rate can
                          be expressed as a percentage appreciation of one currency against the other: One
                          simply has to be careful in identifying which currency is the price currency and which
                          is the base currency. For example, suppose the exchange rate for the euro (USD/EUR)
                          increases from 1.1500 to 1.2000. This represents an (unannualized) percentage change
                          of the following:
                              _  1.2000
                              	​ 1.1500 ​− 1 = 4.35 % .​

                          This represents a 4.35 percent appreciation in the euro against the US dollar (and not
                          an appreciation of the US dollar against the euro) because the USD/EUR exchange
                          rate is expressed with the US dollar as the price currency.
                              Note that this appreciation of the euro against the US dollar also can be expressed
                          as a depreciation of the US dollar against the euro; but in this case, the depreciation is
                          not equal to 4.35 percent. Inverting the exchange rate quote from USD/EUR to EUR/
                          USD, so that the euro is now the price currency, leads to the following:

                              _  ​(_   1
                                   ​1.2000 ​)​       1.1500
                               	​ _          ​− 1 = _
                                                    ​1.2000 ​− 1 = − 4.17%​.
                              ​(​1.1500 ​)​
                                       1


                          Note that the US dollar depreciation is not the same, in percentage terms, as the euro
                          appreciation. Mathematically, these percentages will always be different.

                           EXAMPLE 3

                             Exchange Rate Conventions
                             A dealer based in New York City provides a spot exchange rate quote of 18.8590
                             MXN/USD to a client in Mexico City. The inverse of 18.8590 is 0.0530.

                             1. From the perspective of the Mexican client, the most accurate statement is
                                that the:
                                 A. direct exchange rate quotation is equal to 0.0530.
                                 B. direct exchange rate quotation is equal to 18.8590.
                                 C. indirect exchange rate quotation is equal to 18.8590.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. A direct exchange rate uses the domestic currency as the price
                                currency and the foreign currency as the base currency. For an MXN/USD
                                quote, the Mexican peso is the price currency; therefore, the direct quote
                                for the Mexican client is 18.8590 (it costs MXN18.8590 to purchase USD1).
                                Another way of understanding a direct exchange rate quote is that it is the
                                price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of your own currency. This
                                purchase of a unit of foreign currency can be thought of as a purchase much
                                like any other you might make; think of the unit of foreign currency as just
                                another item that you might be purchasing with your domestic currency.
                                For example, for someone based in Canada, a liter of milk might cost about
                                CAD1.25 at a time when USD1 costs about CAD1.30. This direct currency
                                quote uses the domestic currency (the Canadian dollar, in this case) as the
                                price currency and simply gives the price of a unit of foreign currency that is
                                being purchased.

                             2. If the bid/offer quote from the dealer was 18.8580–18.8600 MXN/USD, then
                                the bid/offer quote in USD/MXN terms would be closest to:
                                 A. 0.05302–0.05303.

      B. 0.05303–0.05302.
       C. 0.053025–0.053025.
      Solution:
      A is correct. An MXN/USD quote is the amount of Mexican pesos the deal-
      er is bidding (offering) to buy (sell) USD1. The dealer’s bid to buy USD1 at
      MXN18.8580 is equivalent to the dealer paying MXN18.8580 to buy USD1.
      Dividing both terms by 18.8580 means the dealer is paying (i.e., selling)
      MXN1 to buy USD0.05303. This is the offer in USD/MXN terms: The dealer
      offers to sell MXN1 at a price of USD0.05303. In USD/MXN terms, the deal-
      er’s bid for MXN1 is 0.05302, calculated by inverting the offer of 18.8600 in
      MXN/USD terms (1/18.8600 = 0.05302). Note that in any bid/offer quote,
      no matter which base or price currencies are used, the bid is always lower
      than the offer.




EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES: IDEALS AND HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE                                                                                   3
              describe exchange rate regimes and explain the effects of exchange
              rates on countries’ international trade and capital flows

FX rates affect international capital flows and trading relationships. These rate move-
ments are based on the relative economic stability and efficiency of the trading countries
involved. As a result, countries having higher or lower economic or trading volatility
use different exchange regimes to address their economic objectives. This lesson
describes these factors and concludes with an example from Malaysia.
    Highly volatile exchange rates create uncertainty that undermines the efficiency of
real economic activity and the financial transactions required to facilitate that activity.
Exchange rate volatility also has a direct impact on investment decisions because it is
a key component of the risk inherent in foreign (i.e., foreign-currency-denominated)
assets. Exchange rate volatility is also a critical factor in selecting hedging strategies
for foreign currency exposures.
    The amount of FX rate volatility will depend, at least in part, on the institutional
and policy arrangements associated with trade in any given currency. Virtually every
exchange rate is managed to some degree by central banks. The policy framework that
each central bank adopts is called an exchange rate regime. Although there are many
potential variations, these regimes fall into a few general categories. Before describing
each of these types, we consider the possibility of an ideal regime and provide some
historical perspective on the evolution of currency arrangements.


The Ideal Currency Regime
The ideal currency regime would have three properties. First, the exchange rate between
any two currencies would be credibly fixed. This would eliminate currency-related
uncertainty with respect to the prices of goods and services as well as real and finan-
cial assets. Second, all currencies would be fully convertible (i.e., currencies could
be freely exchanged for any purpose and in any amount). This condition ensures the

                          unrestricted flow of capital. Third, each country would be able to undertake fully
                          independent monetary policy in pursuit of domestic objectives, such as growth and
                          inflation targets.
                               Unfortunately, these three conditions are not consistent. If the first two conditions
                          were satisfied—credibly fixed exchange rates and full convertibility—then there would
                          really be only one currency in the world. Converting from one national currency to
                          another would have no more significance (indeed less) than deciding whether to carry
                          coins or paper currency in your wallet. Any attempt to influence interest rates, asset
                          prices, or inflation by adjusting the supply of one currency versus another would be
                          futile. Thus, independent monetary policy is not possible if exchange rates are cred-
                          ibly fixed and currencies are fully convertible. There can be no ideal currency regime.
                               The impact of the currency regime on a country’s ability to exercise independent
                          monetary policy is a recurring theme in open-economy macroeconomics. It will be
                          covered in more detail in other readings; however, it is worth emphasizing the basic
                          point by considering what would happen in an idealized world of perfect capital mobil-
                          ity. If the exchange rate were credibly fixed, then any attempt to decrease default-free
                          interest rates in one country below those in another—that is, to undertake independent,
                          expansionary monetary policy—would result in a potentially unlimited outflow of cap-
                          ital because funds would seek the higher return. The central bank would be forced to
                          sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency to maintain the fixed exchange rate.
                          The loss of reserves and reduction in the domestic money supply would put upward
                          pressure on domestic interest rates until rates were forced back to equality, negating
                          the initial expansionary policy. Similarly, a contractionary monetary policy (higher
                          interest rates) would be thwarted by an inflow of capital.
                               The situation is quite different, however, with a floating exchange rate. A decrease
                          in the domestic interest rate would make the domestic currency less attractive. The
                          resulting depreciation of the domestic currency would shift demand toward domesti-
                          cally produced goods (i.e., exports rise and imports fall), reinforcing the expansionary
                          impact of the initial decline in the interest rate. Similarly, a contractionary increase
                          in the interest rate would be reinforced by appreciation of the domestic currency.
                               In practice, of course, capital is not perfectly mobile, and the impact on monetary
                          policy is not so stark. The fact remains, however, that fixed exchange rates limit the
                          scope for independent monetary policy and that national monetary policy regains
                          potency and independence, at least to some degree, if the exchange rate is allowed
                          to fluctuate or restrictions are placed on convertibility. In general, the more freely
                          the exchange rate is allowed to float and the more tightly convertibility is controlled,
                          the more effective the central bank can be in addressing domestic macroeconomic
                          objectives. The downside, of course, is the potential distortion of economic activity
                          caused by exchange rate risk and inefficient allocation of financial capital.


                          Historical Perspective on Currency Regimes
                          How currencies exchange for one another has evolved over the centuries. At any point
                          in time, different exchange rate systems may coexist; still, the world economy tends to
                          have one dominant system. Throughout most of the 19th century and the early 20th
                          century until the start of World War I, the US dollar and the British pound sterling
                          operated on the “classical gold standard.” The price of each currency was fixed in terms
                          of gold. Gold was the numeraire (the unit in terms of which other goods, services,
                          and assets were priced) for each currency; therefore, it was indirectly the numeraire
                          for all other prices in the economy. Many countries (e.g., the colonies of the United
                          Kingdom) fixed their currencies relative to sterling and were therefore implicitly also
                          operating on the classical gold standard.

    The classical gold standard operated by what is called the price-specie-flow mech-
anism. This mechanism operated through the impact of trade imbalances on capital
flows, namely gold. As countries experienced a trade surplus, they accumulated gold
as payment, their domestic money supply expanded by the amount dictated by the
fixed parity, prices rose, and exports fell. Similarly, when a country ran a trade deficit,
there was an automatic outflow of gold, a contraction of the domestic money supply,
and a fall in prices leading to increased exports.
    In this system, national currencies were backed by gold. A country could print only
as much money as its gold reserve allowed. The system was limited by the amount of
gold, but it was self-adjusting and inspired confidence. With a fixed stock of gold, the
price-specie-flow mechanism would work well. Still, new gold discoveries as well as
more efficient methods of refining gold would enable a country to increase its gold
reserves and increase its money supply apart from the effect of trade flows. In general,
however, trade flows drove changes in national money supplies.
    Economic historians disagree about the effect of the classical gold standard on
overall macroeconomic stability. Was it destabilizing? On the one hand, monetary
policy was tied to trade flows, so a country could not engage in expansionary poli-
cies when there was a downturn in the non-traded sector. On the other hand, tying
monetary policy to trade flows kept inflation in check.
    During the 1930s, the use of gold as a clearing device for settlement of trade imbal-
ances, combined with increasing protectionism on the part of economies struggling
with depression as well as episodes of deflation and hyperinflation, created a chaotic
environment for world trade. As a consequence of these factors, world trade dropped
by more than 50 percent and the gold standard was abandoned.
    In the latter stages of World War II, a new system of fixed exchange rates with
periodic realignments was devised by John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White,
representing the UK and US Treasuries, respectively. The Bretton Woods system, named
after the town where it was negotiated, was adopted by 44 countries in 1944. From the
end of the war until the collapse of the system in the early 1970s, the United States,
Japan, and most of the industrial countries of Europe maintained a system of fixed
parities for exchange rates between currencies. When the parities were significantly
and persistently out of line with the balancing of supply and demand, there would be a
realignment of currencies with some appreciating in value and others depreciating in
value. These periodic realignments were viewed as a part of standard monetary policy.
    By 1973, with chronic inflation taking hold throughout the world, most nations
abandoned the Bretton Woods system in favor of a flexible exchange rate system
under what are known as the Smithsonian Agreements. Milton Friedman had called
for such a system as far back as the 1950s. His argument was that the fixed parity
system with periodic realignments would become unsustainable. When the inevitable
realignments were imminent, large speculative profit opportunities would appear.
Speculators would force the hand of monetary policy authorities, and their actions
would distort the data needed to ascertain appropriate trade-related parities. It is
better, he argued, to let the market, rather than central bank governors and treasury
ministers, determine the exchange rate.
    After 1973, most of the industrial world changed to a system of flexible exchange
rates. The original thinking was that the forces that caused exchange rate chaos in the
1930s—poor domestic monetary policy and trade barriers—would not be present in a
flexible exchange rate regime, and therefore exchange rates would move in response
to the exchange of goods and services among countries. However, exchange rates
moved around much more than anyone expected. Academic economists and financial
analysts alike soon realized that the high degree of exchange rate volatility was the
manifestation of a highly liquid, forward-looking asset market. Investment-driven FX
transactions—for both long-term investment and short-term speculation—mattered
much more in setting the spot exchange rate than anyone had previously imagined.

                              There are costs, of course, to a high degree of exchange rate volatility. These include
                          difficulty planning without hedging exchange rate risks—a form of insurance cost,
                          domestic price fluctuations, uncertain costs of raw materials, and short-term inter-
                          ruptions in financing transactions. For these reasons, in 1979 the European Economic
                          Community opted for a system of limited flexibility, the European Exchange Rate
                          Mechanism (ERM).
                              Initially, the system called for European currency values to fluctuate within a narrow
                          band called “the snake,” but this system did not last long. The end of the Cold War
                          and the reunification of Germany created conditions ripe for speculative attack. In the
                          early 1990s, the United Kingdom was in a recession and the government’s monetary
                          policy leaned toward low interest rates to stimulate economic recovery. Germany was
                          issuing large amounts of debt to pay for reunification, and the German central bank
                          (the Deutsche Bundesbank) opted for high interest rates to ensure price stability.
                          Capital began to flow from sterling to Deutsche marks to obtain the higher interest
                          rate. The Bank of England tried to lean against these flows and maintain the exchange
                          rate within the ERM, but eventually it began to run out of marks to sell. Because it
                          was almost certain that devaluation would be required, holders of sterling rushed to
                          purchase marks at the old rate, and the speculative attack forced the United Kingdom
                          out of the ERM in September 1992, only two years after it finally had joined the system.
                              Despite these difficulties, 1999 saw the creation of a common currency for most
                          Western European countries, without Switzerland or the United Kingdom, called the
                          euro. The hope was that the common currency would increase transparency of prices
                          across borders in Europe, enhance market competition, and facilitate more efficient
                          allocation of resources. The drawback, of course, is that each member country lost
                          the ability to manage its exchange rate and therefore to engage in independent mon-
                          etary policy.

                             1. An exchange rate:
                                 A. is most commonly quoted in real terms.
                                 B. is the price of one currency in terms of another.
                                 C. between two currencies ensures that they are fully convertible.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. The exchange rate is the number of units of the price currency
                                that one unit of the base currency will buy. Equivalently, it is the number of
                                units of the price currency required to buy one unit of the base currency.

                             2. Which of the following is not a condition of an ideal currency regime?
                                 A. Fully convertible currencies
                                 B. Fully independent monetary policy
                                 C. Independently floating exchange rates
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. An ideal currency regime would have credibly fixed exchange
                                rates among all currencies. This would eliminate currency-related uncer-
                                tainty with respect to the prices of goods and services as well as real and
                                financial assets.

Exchange Rate Regimes: Ideals and Historical Perspective                                                               237



A Taxonomy of Currency Regimes
Although the pros and cons of fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes continue to be
debated, regimes have been adopted that lie somewhere between these polar cases. In
some cases, the driving force is the lack of credibility with respect to sound monetary
policy. An economy with a history of hyperinflation may be forced to adopt a form of
fixed-rate regime because its promise to maintain a sound currency with a floating
rate regime would not be credible. This has been a persistent issue in Latin America.
In other cases, the driving force is as much political as it is economic. The decision
to create the euro was strongly influenced by the desire to enhance political union
within the European Community, whose members had been at war with each other
twice in the 20th century.
    As of April 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified exchange rate
regimes into the eight categories shown in Exhibit 6.

                                 Global financial markets are too complex and diverse to be fully captured by this (or
                                 any other) classification system. A government’s control over the domestic currency’s
                                 exchange rate will depend on many factors; for example, the degree of capital controls
                                 used to prevent the free flow of funds in and out of the economy. Also, even under an
                                 “independent float” regime, monetary authorities will occasionally intervene in FX
                                 markets to influence the value of their domestic currency. Additionally, the specifics
                                 of exchange rate policy implementation are subject to change.
                                     This means that the classifications in Exhibit 6 are somewhat arbitrary and subject
                                 to interpretation, and they change over time. The important point is that the prices and
                                 flows in FX markets will, to varying degrees, reflect the legal and regulatory framework
                                 imposed by governments, not just “pure” market forces. Governments have a variety
                                 of motives and tools to attempt to manage exchange rates. The taxonomy in Exhibit
                                 6 can be used to help understand the main distinctions among currency regimes and
                                 the rationales for adopting them, but the specific definitions should not be interpreted
                                 too rigidly. Instead, the focus should be on the diversity of FX markets globally as well
                                 as the implications of these various currency regimes for market pricing.

                                 Arrangements with No Separate Legal Tender
                                 The IMF identifies two types of arrangements for countries that do not have their
                                 own legal tender. In the first, known as dollarization, the country uses the currency
                                 of another nation as its medium of exchange and unit of account. In the second, the
                                 country participates in a monetary union whose members share the same legal tender.
                                 In either case, the country gives up the ability to conduct its own monetary policy.
                                     In principle, a country could adopt any currency as its medium of exchange and
                                 unit of account, but the main reserve currency, the US dollar, is an obvious choice—
                                 hence the name dollarization. Many countries are dollarized: East Timor, El Salvador,
                                 Ecuador, and Panama, for example. By adopting another country’s currency as legal
                                 tender, a dollarized country inherits that country’s currency credibility, but not its
                                 creditworthiness. For example, although local banks may borrow, lend, and accept
                                 deposits in US dollars, they are not members of the US Federal Reserve System, nor
                                 are they backed by deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
                                 Thus, interest rates on US dollars in a dollarized economy need not be, and generally
                                 are not, the same as on dollar deposits in the United States.
                                     Dollarization imposes fiscal discipline by eliminating the possibility that the cen-
                                 tral bank will be induced to monetize government debt (i.e., to persistently purchase
                                 government debt with newly created local currency). For countries with a history of
                                 fiscal excess or a lack of monetary discipline, dollarizing the economy can facilitate
                                 growth of international trade and capital flows if it creates an expectation of economic
                                 and financial stability. In the process, however, it removes another potential source
                                 of stabilization—domestic monetary policy.

Exchange Rate Regimes: Ideals and Historical Perspective                                    239


    The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is the most prominent
example of the second type of arrangement lacking separate legal tender. Each EMU
member country uses the euro as its currency. Although member countries cannot
have their own monetary policies, they jointly determine monetary policy through
their representation at the European Central Bank (ECB). As with dollarization, a
monetary union confers currency credibility on members with a history of fiscal excess
or a lack of monetary discipline. As shown by the 2010 EMU sovereign debt crisis,
however, a monetary union alone cannot confer creditworthiness.

Currency Board System
The IMF defines a currency board system (CBS) as follows:
       A monetary regime based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange
       domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate,
       combined with restrictions on the issuing authority to ensure fulfillment
       of its legal obligation. This implies that domestic currency will be issued
       only against foreign exchange and it remains fully backed by foreign assets.
     Hong Kong SAR has the leading example of a long-standing (since 1983) currency
board. US dollar reserves are held to cover, at the fixed parity, the entire monetary
base—essentially bank reserves plus all Hong Kong dollar notes and coins in circula-
tion. Note that Hong Kong-dollar-denominated bank deposits are not fully collater-
alized by US dollar reserves; to do so would mean that banks could not lend against
their deposits. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) does not function as
a traditional central bank under this system because the obligation to maintain 100
percent foreign currency reserves against the monetary base prevents it from acting
as a lender-of-last-resort for troubled financial institutions. It can, however, provide
short-term liquidity by lending against foreign currency collateral.
     A CBS works much like the classical gold standard in that expansion and contraction
of the monetary base are directly linked to trade and capital flows. As with the gold
standard, a CBS works best if domestic prices and wages are very flexible, non-traded
sectors of the domestic economy are relatively small, and the global supply of the
reserve asset grows at a slow, steady rate consistent with long-run real growth with
stable prices. The first two of these conditions are satisfied in Hong Kong SAR. Until
and unless Hong Kong SAR selects a new reserve asset, however, the third condition
depends on US monetary policy.
     In practice, the HKD exhibits modest fluctuations around the official parity of
HKD/USD = 7.80 because the HKMA buys (sells) US dollars at a pre-announced
level slightly below (above) the parity. Persistent flows on one side of this convert-
ibility zone or the other result in interest rate adjustments rather than exchange rate
adjustments. Inside the zone, however, the exchange rate is determined by the market
and the HKMA is free to conduct limited monetary operations aimed at dampening
transitory interest rate movements.
     One of the advantages of a CBS as opposed to dollarization is that the monetary
authority can earn a profit by paying little or no interest on its liability—the monetary
base—and can earn a market rate on its asset—the foreign currency reserves. This
profit is called seigniorage. Under dollarization, the seigniorage goes to the monetary
authority whose currency is used.

Fixed Parity
A simple fixed-rate system differs from a CBS in two important respects. First, there
is no legislative commitment to maintaining the specified parity. Thus, market par-
ticipants know that the country may choose to adjust or abandon the parity rather
than endure other, potentially more painful, adjustments. Second, the target level of
FX reserves is discretionary; it bears no particular relationship to domestic monetary

                          aggregates. Thus, although monetary independence is ultimately limited as long as
                          the exchange peg is maintained, the central bank can carry out traditional functions,
                          such as serving as lender of last resort.
                              In the conventional fixed-rate system, the exchange rate may be pegged to a sin-
                          gle currency—for example, the US dollar—or to a basket index of the currencies of
                          major trading partners. There is a band of up to ±1 percent around the parity level
                          within which private flows are allowed to determine the exchange rate. The monetary
                          authority stands ready to spend its foreign currency reserves, or buy foreign currency,
                          to maintain the rate within these bands.
                              The credibility of the fixed parity depends on the country’s willingness and ability
                          to offset imbalances in private sector demand for its currency. Both excess and defi-
                          cient private demand for the currency can exert pressure to adjust or abandon the
                          parity. Excess private demand for the domestic currency implies a rapidly growing
                          stock of FX reserves, expansion of the domestic money supply, and potentially accel-
                          erating inflation. Deficient demand for the currency depletes FX reserves and exerts
                          deflationary pressure on the economy. If market participants believe the FX reserves
                          are insufficient to sustain the parity, then that belief may be self-fulfilling because the
                          resulting speculative attack will drain reserves and may force an immediate devalu-
                          ation. Thus, the level of reserves required to maintain credibility is a key issue for a
                          simple fixed exchange rate regime.

                          Target Zone
                          A target zone regime has a fixed parity with fixed horizontal intervention bands that
                          are somewhat wider—up to ±2 percent around the parity—than in the simple fixed
                          parity regime. The wider bands provide the monetary authority with greater scope
                          for discretionary policy.

                          Active and Passive Crawling Pegs
                          Crawling pegs for the exchange rate—usually against a single currency, such as the
                          US dollar—were common in the 1980s in Latin America, particularly Brazil, during
                          the high inflation periods. To prevent a run on the US dollar reserves, the exchange
                          rate was adjusted frequently (weekly or daily) to keep pace with the inflation rate.
                          Such a system was called a passive crawl. An adaptation used in Argentina, Chile, and
                          Uruguay was the active crawl: The exchange rate was pre-announced for the coming
                          weeks with changes taking place in small steps. The aim of the active crawl was to
                          manipulate expectations of inflation. Because the domestic prices of many goods
                          were directly tied to import prices, announced changes in the exchange rate would
                          effectively signal future changes in the inflation rate of these goods.

                          Fixed Parity with Crawling Bands
                          A country can also have a fixed central parity with crawling bands. Initially, a country
                          may fix its rates to a foreign currency to anchor expectations about future inflation,
                          but then the country may gradually permit increasing flexibility in the form of a
                          pre-announced widening band around the central parity. Such a system has the
                          desirable property of allowing a gradual exit strategy from the fixed parity. A country
                          might want to introduce greater flexibility and greater scope for monetary policy, but
                          it may not yet have the credibility or financial infrastructure for full flexibility. In this
                          case, it can maintain a fixed parity with slowly widening bands.

                          Managed Float
                          A country may simply follow an exchange rate policy based on either internal or
                          external policy targets—intervening or not to achieve trade balance, price stability,
                          or employment objectives. Such a policy, often called dirty floating, invites trading

partners to respond likewise with their exchange rate policy and potentially decreases
stability in FX markets as a whole. The exchange rate target, in terms of either a level
or a rate of change, typically is not explicit.

Independently Floating Rates
In this case, the exchange rate is left to market determination and the monetary
authority is able to exercise independent monetary policy aimed at achieving such
objectives as price stability and full employment. The central bank also has latitude
to act as a lender of last resort to troubled financial institutions, if necessary.
    It should be clear from recent experience that the concepts of float, managed
float, crawl, and target zone are not hard and fast rules. Central banks do occasion-
ally engage, implicitly or explicitly, in regime switches—even in countries nominally
following an independently floating exchange rate regime. For example, when the US
dollar appreciated in the mid-1980s with record US trade deficits, then-US Treasury
Secretary James Baker engineered the Plaza Accord, in which Japan and Germany
implemented an appreciation of their currencies against the US dollar. (The Plaza
Accord is so named because it was negotiated at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.)
This 1985 policy agreement involved a combination of fiscal and monetary policy
measures by the countries involved as well as direct intervention in FX markets. The
Plaza Accord was a clear departure from a pure independently floating exchange rate
system.
    There are more recent examples of government intervention in FX markets. In
September 2000, the ECB, the Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England, and the Bank of Canada engaged in “concerted” intervention to support the
value of the euro, a “freely floating” currency that was then under pressure within FX
markets. (This intervention was described as “concerted” because it was pre-arranged
and coordinated among the central banks involved.) During 2010, many countries
engaged in unilateral intervention to prevent the rapid appreciation of their curren-
cies against the US dollar. Several of these countries also employed various fiscal and
regulatory measures (e.g., taxes on capital inflows) to further affect exchange rate
movements.
    The important point to draw from this discussion is that exchange rates not only
reflect private sector market forces but also will be influenced, to varying degrees,
by the legal and regulatory framework (currency regimes) within which FX markets
operate. Moreover, they will occasionally be influenced by government policies (fiscal,
monetary, and intervention) intended to manage exchange rates. All of these can vary
widely among countries and are subject to change with time.
    Nonetheless, the most widely traded currencies in FX markets (the US dollar, yen,
euro, UK pound, Swiss franc, and the Canadian and Australian dollars) are typically
considered to be free floating, although subject to relatively infrequent intervention.

EXAMPLE 4

  Exchange Rate Regimes
  An investment adviser in Los Angeles, United States, is meeting with a client
  who wishes to diversify her portfolio by including more international invest-
  ments. To evaluate the suitability of international diversification for the client,
  the adviser attempts to explain some of the characteristics of FX markets. The
  adviser points out that exchange rate regimes affect the performance of domestic
  economies as well as the amount of FX risk posed by international investments.

                                 The client and her adviser discuss potential investments in Hong Kong SAR,
                             Panama, and Canada. The adviser notes that the currency regimes of Hong
                             Kong SAR, Panama, and Canada are a currency board, dollarization, and a free
                             float, respectively. The adviser tells his client that these regimes imply different
                             degrees of FX risk for her portfolio.
                                 The discussion between the investment adviser and his client then turns to
                             potential investments in other markets with different currency regimes. The
                             adviser notes that some markets are subject to fixed parity regimes against the
                             US dollar. The client asks whether a fixed parity regime would imply less foreign
                             currency risk for her portfolio than would a currency board. The adviser replies:
                             “Yes, a fixed parity regime means a constant exchange rate and is more credible
                             than a currency board.”
                                 The adviser goes on to explain that in some markets, exchange rates are
                             allowed to vary, although with different degrees of FX market intervention to
                             limit exchange rate volatility. Citing examples, he notes that mainland China
                             has a crawling peg regime with reference to the US dollar, but the average daily
                             percentage changes in the mainland China/US exchange rate are very small
                             compared with the average daily volatility for a freely floating currency. The
                             adviser also indicates that Denmark has a target zone regime with reference
                             to the euro, and South Korea usually follows a freely floating currency regime
                             but sometimes switches to a managed float regime. The currencies of mainland
                             China, Denmark, and South Korea are the yuan renminbi (CNY), krone (DKK),
                             and won (KRW), respectively.

                             1. Based solely on the exchange rate risk the client would face, what is the
                                correct ranking (from most to least risky) of the following investment
                                locations?
                                 A. Panama, Canada, Hong Kong SAR
                                 B. Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Panama
                                 C. Hong Kong SAR, Panama, Canada
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. The CAD/USD exchange rate is a floating exchange rate, and
                                Canadian investments would therefore carry exchange rate risk for a US-
                                based investor. Although Hong Kong SAR follows a currency board system,
                                the HKD/USD exchange rate nonetheless does display some variation, albeit
                                much less than in a floating exchange rate regime. In contrast, Panama has
                                a dollarized economy (i.e., it uses the US dollar as the domestic currency);
                                therefore, there is no FX risk for a US investor.

                             2. Based solely on their FX regimes, which investment location is least likely to
                                import inflation or deflation from the United States?
                                 A. Canada
                                 B. Panama
                                 C. Hong Kong SAR
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The Canadian dollar floats independently against the US dollar
                                leaving the Bank of Canada able to adjust monetary policy to maintain price
                                stability. Neither Hong Kong SAR (currency board) nor Panama (dollarized)
                                can exercise independent monetary policy to buffer its economy from the
                                inflationary or deflationary consequences of US monetary policy.

  3. The adviser’s reply about fixed parity regimes is incorrect with regard to:
      A. credibility.
      B. a constant exchange rate.
      C. both a constant exchange rate and credibility.
     Solution:
     C is correct. A fixed exchange rate regime does not mean that the exchange
     rate is rigidly fixed at a constant level. In practice, both a fixed-rate regime
     and a currency board allow the exchange rate to vary within a band around
     the stated parity level. Thus, both regimes involve at least a modest amount
     of exchange rate risk. The fixed parity regime exposes the investor to the ad-
     ditional risk that the parity may not be maintained. In a fixed parity regime,
     the level of foreign currency reserves is discretionary and typically only a
     small fraction of the domestic money supply. With no legal obligation to
     maintain the parity, the monetary authority may adjust the parity (devalue
     or revalue its currency) or allow its currency to float if doing so is deemed to
     be less painful than other adjustment mechanisms (e.g., fiscal restraint). In
     contrast, a currency board entails a legal commitment to maintain the parity
     and to fully back the domestic currency with reserve currency assets. Hence,
     there is little risk that the parity will be abandoned.

  4. Based on the adviser’s categorization of mainland China’s currency regime,
     if the US dollar is depreciating against the South Korean won, then it is most
     likely correct that the Chinese yuan is:
      A. fixed against the South Korean won.
      B. appreciating against the South Korean won.
      C. depreciating against the South Korean won.
     Solution:
     C is correct. If the Chinese yuan is subject to a crawling peg with very small
     daily adjustments versus the US dollar, and the US dollar is depreciating
     against the South Korean won, then the Chinese yuan mostlikely would be
     depreciating against the South Korean won as well. In fact, this was an im-
     portant issue in FX markets through the latter part of 2010: As the US dollar
     depreciated against most Asian currencies (and less so against the Chinese
     yuan), many Asian countries felt that they were losing their competitive
     export advantage because the Chinese yuan was so closely tied to the US
     dollar. This led many Asian countries to intervene in FX markets against
     the strength of their domestic currencies to avoid losing an export pricing
     advantage against the Chinese mainland.

  5. Based on the adviser’s categorization of Denmark’s currency regime, it
     would be most correct to infer that the:
      A. krone is allowed to float against the euro within fixed bands.
      B. Danish central bank will intervene if the exchange rate strays from its
         target level.
      C. target zone will be adjusted periodically to manage inflation
         expectations.
     Solution:
     A is correct. A target zone means that the exchange rate between the euro
     and Danish krone (DKK) will be allowed to vary within a fixed band (as of
     2010, the target zone for the DKK/EUR is a ±2.5 percent band). This does

                                not mean that the DKK/EUR rate is fixed at a certain level (B is incorrect)
                                or that the target zone will vary to manage inflation expectations (this is a
                                description of a crawling peg, which makes C incorrect).

                             6. Based on the adviser’s categorization of South Korea’s currency policy, it
                                would be most correct to infer that the Korean:
                                 A. central bank is engineering a gradual exit from a fixed-rate regime.
                                 B. government is attempting to peg the exchange rate within a predefined
                                    zone.
                                 C. won is allowed to float, but with occasional intervention by the Korean
                                    central bank.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Similar to the monetary authorities responsible for many of
                                the world’s major currencies, the South Korean policy typically involves
                                letting market forces determine the exchange rate (an independent floating
                                rate regime). But this approach does not mean that market forces are the
                                sole determinant of the won exchange rate. As with most governments,
                                the South Korean policy is to intervene in FX markets when movements in
                                the exchange rate are viewed as undesirable (a managed float). For exam-
                                ple, during the latter part of 2010, South Korea and many other countries
                                intervened in FX markets to moderate the appreciation of their currencies
                                against the US dollar. Answer A describes a fixed parity with a crawling
                                bands regime, and B describes a target zone regime: Both answers are
                                incorrect.



                           QUESTION SET


                             1. In practice, both a fixed parity regime and a target zone regime
                                allow the exchange rate to float within a band around the parity level. The
                                most likely rationale for the band is that the band allows the monetary au-
                                thority to:
                                 A. be less active in the currency market.
                                 B. earn a spread on its currency transactions.
                                 C. exercise more discretion in monetary policy.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Fixed exchange rates impose severe limitations on the exercise
                                of independent monetary policy. With a rigidly fixed exchange rate, do-
                                mestic interest rates, monetary aggregates (e.g., money supply), and credit
                                conditions are dictated by the requirement to buy/sell the currency at the
                                rigid parity. Even a narrow band around the parity level allows the monetary
                                authority to exercise some discretionary control over these conditions. In
                                general, the wider the band, the more independent control the monetary
                                authority can exercise.

                             2. A fixed exchange rate regime in which the monetary authority is legally
                                required to hold FX reserves backing 100 percent of its domestic currency
                                issuance is best described as:
                                 A. dollarization.
                                 B. a currency board.

       C. a monetary union.
      Solution:
      B is correct. With a currency board, the monetary authority is legally
      required to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at
      a fixed exchange rate. It cannot issue domestic currency without receiving
      foreign currency in exchange, and it must hold that foreign currency as a
      100 percent reserve against the domestic currency issued. Thus, the coun-
      try’s monetary base (bank reserves plus notes and coins in circulation) is
      fully backed by FX reserves.



Exchange Rates and the Trade Balance: Introduction
Just as a family that spends more than it earns must borrow or sell assets to finance
the excess, a country that imports more goods and services than it exports must either
borrow from or sell assets to foreign entities to finance the trade deficit. Conversely, a
country that exports more goods and services than it imports must invest the excess
either by lending to foreigners or by buying assets from foreigners. Thus, a trade
deficit (surplus) must be exactly matched by an offsetting capital account surplus
(deficit). This implies that any factor that affects the trade balance must have an equal
and opposite impact on the capital account, and vice versa. To put this differently,
the impact of exchange rates and other factors on the trade balance must be mirrored
by their impact on capital flows: They cannot affect one without affecting the other.
    Using a fundamental identity from macroeconomics, the relationship between the
trade balance and expenditure/saving decisions can be expressed as follows:
   X − M = (S − I) + (T − G),
where X represents exports, M is imports, S is private savings, I is investment in
plant and equipment, T is taxes net of transfers, and G is government expenditure.
From this relationship, we can see that a trade surplus (X > M) must be reflected in
a fiscal surplus (T > G), an excess of private saving over investment (S > I), or both.
Because a fiscal surplus can be viewed as government saving, we can summarize this
relationship more simply by saying that a trade surplus means the country saves more
than enough to fund its investment (I) in plant and equipment. The excess saving
is used to accumulate financial claims on the rest of the world. Conversely, a trade
deficit means the country does not save enough to fund its investment spending (I)
and must reduce its net financial claims on the rest of the world.
    Although this identity provides a key link between real expenditure and saving
decisions and the aggregate flow of financial assets into or out of a country, it does
not tell us what type of financial assets will be exchanged or in what currency they
will be denominated. All that can be said is that asset prices and exchange rates at
home and abroad must adjust so that all financial assets are willingly held by investors.
    If investors anticipate a significant change in an exchange rate, they will try to sell
the currency that is expected to depreciate and buy the currency that is expected to
appreciate. This implies an incipient (i.e., potential) flow of capital from one country
to the other, which must either be accompanied by a simultaneous shift in the trade
balance or be discouraged by changes in asset prices and exchange rates. Because
expenditure/saving decisions and prices of goods change much more slowly than
financial investment decisions and asset prices, most of the adjustment usually occurs
within the financial markets. That is, asset prices and exchange rates adjust so that the
potential flow of financial capital is mitigated and actual capital flows remain consistent
with trade flows. In a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank offsets the private
capital flows in the process of maintaining the exchange rate peg and the adjustment
occurs in other asset prices, typically interest rates, until and unless the central bank

                          is forced to allow the exchange rate to adjust. In a floating exchange rate regime, the
                          main adjustment is often a rapid change in the exchange rate that dampens an investor’s
                          conviction that further movement will be forthcoming. Thus, capital flows—potential
                          and actual—are the primary determinant of exchange rate movements in the short to
                          intermediate term. Trade flows become increasingly important in the long term as
                          expenditure and saving decisions as well as the prices of goods and services adjust.

                           QUESTION SET


                             1. A country with a trade deficit will most likely:
                                 A. have an offsetting capital account surplus.
                                 B. save enough to fund its investment spending.
                                 C. buy assets from foreigners to fund the imbalance.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. A trade deficit must be exactly matched by an offsetting capital
                                account surplus to fund the deficit. A capital account surplus reflects bor-
                                rowing from foreigners (an increase in domestic liabilities) and/or selling
                                assets to foreigners (a decrease in domestic assets). A capital account sur-
                                plus is often referred to as a “capital inflow” because the net effect is foreign
                                investment in the domestic economy.




              4           CAPITAL RESTRICTIONS

                                        describe common objectives of capital restrictions imposed by
                                        governments

                          Governments restrict inward and outward flow of capital for many reasons. For
                          example, the government may want to meet some objective regarding employment
                          or regional development, or it may have a strategic or defense-related objective. Many
                          countries require approval for foreigners to invest in their country and for citizens
                          to invest abroad. Control over inward investment by foreigners results in restrictions
                          on how much can be invested, and on the type of industries in which capital can be
                          invested. For example, such strategic industries as defense and telecommunications
                          are often subject to ownership restrictions. Outflow restrictions can include restric-
                          tions on repatriation of capital, interest, profits, royalty payments, and license fees.
                          Citizens are often limited in their ability to invest abroad, especially in FX-scarce
                          economies, and there can be deadlines for repatriation of income earned from any
                          investments abroad.
                              Economists consider free movement of financial capital to be beneficial because it
                          allows capital to be invested where it will earn the highest return. Inflows of capital also
                          allow countries to invest in productive capacity at a rate that is higher than could be
                          achieved with domestic savings alone, and it can enable countries to achieve a higher
                          rate of growth. Long-term investments by foreign firms that establish a presence in
                          the local economy can bring in not only much needed capital but also new technol-
                          ogy, skills, and advanced production and management practices as well as create
                          spillover benefits for local firms. Investment by foreign firms can create a network of
                          local suppliers if they source some of their components locally. Such suppliers may

Capital Restrictions                                                                          247


receive advanced training and spillover benefits from a close working relationship
with the foreign firms. On the one hand, increased competition from foreign firms
in the market may force domestic firms to become more efficient. On the other hand,
it is possible that the domestic industry may be hurt because domestic firms that are
unable to compete are forced to exit the market.
     In times of macroeconomic crisis, capital mobility can result in capital flight out
of the country, especially if most of the inflow reflects short-term portfolio flows into
stocks, bonds, and other liquid assets rather than foreign direct investment in produc-
tive assets. In such circumstances, capital restrictions are often used in conjunction
with other policy instruments, such as fixed exchange rate targets. Capital restrictions
and fixed exchange rate targets are complementary instruments because in a regime
of perfect capital mobility, governments cannot achieve domestic and external policy
objectives simultaneously using only standard monetary and fiscal policy tools. By
limiting the free flow of capital, capital controls provide a way to exercise control over
a country’s external balance, whereas more traditional macro-policy tools are used
to address other objectives.
     Modern capital controls were developed by the belligerents in World War I as a
method to finance the war effort. At the start of the war, all major powers restricted
capital outflows (i.e., the purchase of foreign assets or loans abroad). These restrictions
raised revenues by keeping capital in the domestic economies, facilitating the taxation
of wealth, and producing interest income. Moreover, capital controls helped to main-
tain a low level of interest rates, reducing the governments’ borrowing costs on their
liabilities. Since World War I, controls on capital outflows have been used similarly in
other countries, mostly developing nations, to generate revenue for governments or
to permit them to allocate credit in their domestic economies without risking capital
flight. In broad terms, a capital restriction is any policy designed to limit or redirect
capital flows. Such restrictions may take the form of taxes, price or quantity controls,
or outright prohibitions on international trade in assets. Price controls may take the
form of special taxes on returns to international investment, taxes on certain types
of transactions, or mandatory reserve requirements—that is, a requirement forcing
foreign parties wishing to deposit money in a domestic bank account to deposit
some percentage of the inflow with the central bank for a minimum period at zero
interest. Quantity restrictions on capital flows may include rules imposing ceilings or
requiring special authorization for new or existing borrowing from foreign creditors.
Or administrative controls may have an impact on cross-border capital movements
in which a government agency must approve transactions for certain types of assets.
     Effective implementation of capital restrictions may entail non-trivial adminis-
tration costs, particularly if the measures have to be broadened to close potential
loopholes. Protecting the domestic financial markets by capital restrictions also
may postpone necessary policy adjustments or impede private-sector adaptation
to changing international circumstances. Most important, controls may give rise to
negative market perceptions, which may, in turn, make it more costly and difficult for
the country to access foreign funds.
     In a study on the effectiveness of capital controls, the International Monetary Fund
considered restrictions on capital outflows and inflows separately. The authors con-
cluded that for restrictions on capital inflows to be effective (i.e., not circumvented),
the coverage needs to be comprehensive and the controls need to be implemented
forcefully. Considerable administrative costs are incurred in continuously extending,
amending, and monitoring compliance with the regulations. Although controls on
inflows appeared to be effective in some countries, it was difficult to distinguish the
impact of the controls from the impact of other policies, such as strengthening of
prudential regulations, increased exchange rate flexibility, and adjustment of mone-
tary policy. In the case of capital outflows, the imposition of controls during episodes

                          of financial crisis seems to have produced mixed results, providing only temporary
                          relief of varying duration to some countries, while successfully shielding others (e.g.,
                          Malaysia) and providing them with sufficient time to restructure their economies.

                           EXAMPLE 5

                             Historical Example—Capital Restrictions: Malaysia’s
                             Capital Controls in 1998–2001
                             After the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997, Southeast Asia suffered
                             from significant capital outflows that led to falling local equity and real estate
                             prices and declining exchange rates. To counter the outflows of capital, the
                             IMF urged many of the countries in the region to increase interest rates, thus
                             making their assets more attractive to foreign investors. Higher interest rates,
                             however, weighed heavily on the domestic economies. In response to this
                             dilemma, Malaysia imposed capital controls on 1 September 1998. These con-
                             trols prohibited transfers between domestic and foreign accounts, eliminated
                             credit facilities to offshore parties, prevented repatriation of investment until
                             1 September 1999, and fixed the exchange rate of the Malaysian ringgit at 3.8
                             per US dollar. In February 1999, a system of taxes on capital flows replaced the
                             prohibition on repatriation of capital. Although the details were complex, the
                             net effect was to discourage short-term capital flows while permitting long-term
                             transactions. By imposing capital controls, Malaysia hoped to regain monetary
                             independence and to be able to cut interest rates without provoking a fall in
                             the value of its currency as investors avoided Malaysian assets. The imposition
                             of outflow controls indeed curtailed speculative capital outflows and allowed
                             interest rates to be reduced substantially. At the same time, under the umbrella
                             of the capital controls, the authorities pursued bank and corporate restructuring
                             and achieved a strong economic recovery in 1999 and 2000. With the restoration
                             of economic and financial stability, administrative controls on portfolio outflows
                             were replaced by a two-tier, price-based exit system in February 1999, which
                             was finally eliminated in May 2001. Although Malaysia’s capital controls did
                             contribute to a stabilization of its economy, they came with long-term costs
                             associated with the country’s removal from the MSCI developed equity market
                             index, an important benchmark in the institutional asset management industry,
                             and its relegation to the emerging market universe. The Malaysian market was
                             no longer seen as on par with developed equity markets whose institutional and
                             regulatory frameworks provide a higher standard of safety for investors. As a
                             result, a number of market analysts suggested that it became more difficult for
                             Malaysia to attract net long-term capital inflows.

                             1. Under what economic circumstances were Malaysia’s capital restrictions
                                imposed?
                                Solution:
                                As a result of the Southeast Asian crisis, Malaysia suffered substantial net
                                capital outflows pushing up the domestic interest rate level.

                             2. What was the ultimate objective of Malaysia’s capital restrictions?
                                Solution:
                                The restrictions were designed to limit and redirect capital flows to allow
                                the government to reduce interest rates and pursue bank and corporate
                                restructurings.

   3. How successful were the country’s capital restrictions?
      Solution:
      Although the capital controls helped stabilize Malaysia’s economy, they con-
      tributed to a change in investors’ perception of Malaysian financial markets
      and the removal of the Malaysian equity market from the MSCI benchmark
      universe of developed equity markets. This situation undermined interna-
      tional demand for Malaysian equities and made it more difficult to attract
      net long-term capital inflows.

                             PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                          1. What will be the effect on a direct exchange rate quote if the domestic currency
                             appreciates?
                              A. Increase

                              B. Decrease

                              C. No change

                          2. An executive from Switzerland checks into a hotel room in Spain and is told by
                             the manager that EUR1 will buy CHF1.2983. From the executive’s perspective, an
                             indirect exchange rate quote would be:
                              A. EUR0.7702 per CHF1.

                              B. CHF0.7702 per EUR1.

                              C. EUR1.2983 per CHF1.

                          3. Over the past month, the Swiss franc (CHF) has depreciated 12 percent against
                             the British pound (GBP). How much has the pound sterling appreciated against
                             the Swiss franc?
                              A. 12 percent

                              B. Less than 12 percent

                              C. More than 12 percent

                             currency has appreciated by 8 percent against the price currency, the initial ex-
                             change rate between the two currencies was closest to:
                              A. 1.3340.

                              B. 1.3426.

   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. In the case of a direct exchange rate, the domestic currency is the
   price currency (the numerator) and the foreign currency is the base currency
   (the denominator). If the domestic currency appreciates, then fewer units of
   the domestic currency are required to buy one unit of the foreign currency, and
   the exchange rate (domestic per foreign) declines. For example, if British pound
   sterling (GBP) appreciates against the euro (EUR), then euro–sterling (GBP/EUR)
   might decline.

2. A is correct. An indirect quote takes the foreign country as the price currency
   and the domestic country as the base currency. To get Swiss francs—which is the
   executive’s domestic currency—as the base currency, the quote must be stated
   as EUR/CHF. Using the manager’s information, the indirect exchange rate is
   (1/1.2983) = 0.7702.

3. C is correct. The appreciation of the British pound against the Swiss franc is the
   inverse of the 12 percent depreciation of the Swiss franc against the pound ster-
   ling: [1/(1 – 0.12)] – 1 = (1/0.88) – 1 = 0.1364, or 13.64%.

4. B is correct. The percentage appreciation of the base currency can be calculated
   by dividing the appreciated exchange rate by the initial exchange rate. In this
   case, the unknown is the initial exchange rate. The initial exchange is the value of
   X that satisfies the formula:
   1.4500/X = 1.08
   Solving for X leads to 1.45/1.08 = 1.3426.

INTRODUCTION
The foreign exchange market facilitates international currency and trade flows, and it
                                                                                          1
is important to understand how currency exchange rates are calculated. Market par-
ticipants can also derive cross-rates to expand trading opportunities by determining
quotes for currencies not directly traded. Understanding the concept of arbitrage
relationships in the foreign exchange market provides a basis for understanding the
interrelationships between four key market inputs. Global entities trade currencies for
a wide variety of purposes and understanding the relationships between the market
factors affecting spot and forward rates is crucial. These interactions are reinforced
by the calculations in the second lesson.

  LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

      ■   An exchange rate between two currencies that are not
          expressly quoted on the market is known as a cross-rate and
          can be calculated using conventional currency quotes.
      ■   Three conventional currency market quotes can be used with one
          inversion to calculate a cross-rate.
      ■   Discrepancies in exchange rates can create arbitrage opportunities but
          they are rare due to market efficiencies.
      ■   The premium of a forward exchange rate over a spot rate is quoted in
          terms of forward points, which are also called swap points.
      ■   Forward rates are directly proportional to currency spot rates, the
          interest rate differential, and the maturity of the forward contract.

                          Global currencies are bought, sold, and exchanged in the foreign exchange (FX)
                          market. In this decentralized market, participants trade currencies utilizing exchange
                          rates, which typically reflect an efficient market. This section will cover the use of
                          cross exchange rate relationships (cross-rates) to calculate exchange rates between
                          two currencies using a third currency. It also will introduce calculations used in the
                          FX market to trade currencies.
                               Given two exchange rates involving three currencies, it is possible to back out the
                          cross-rate. For example, as we have seen in a prior lesson, the FX market convention
                          is to quote the exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro as euro–dollar
                          (USD/EUR). The FX market also quotes the exchange rate between the Canadian
                          dollar and US dollar as dollar–Canada (CAD/USD). Given these two exchange rates,
                          it is possible to back out the cross-rate between the euro and the Canadian dollar,
                          which according to market convention is quoted as euro–Canada (CAD/EUR). This
                          calculation is shown as follows:
                              _ CAD USD           CAD _    ​USD​   CAD
                              	​ USD ​× ​_       _                 _
                                         EUR ​ = ​​USD​​× ​EUR ​ = ​EUR ​.​
                          Hence, to get a euro–Canada (CAD/EUR) quote, we must multiply the dollar–Canada
                          (CAD/USD) quote by the euro–dollar (USD/EUR) quote. For example, assume the
                          exchange rate for dollar–Canada is 1.3020 and the exchange rate for euro–dollar is
                          1.1701. Using these spot exchange rates, the euro–Canada cross-rate equals:
                              1.3020 × 1.1701 = 1.5235 CAD per EUR.
                          The professional FX market does not use the convention of direct or indirect quotes
                          because these conventions depend on one’s location to determine the domestic ver-
                          sus foreign currencies. Instead, the market uses rate quotes on defined conventional
                          currency pairs. Sometimes, to get a cross-rate using several currency quotes, it is
                          necessary to invert a quote to get an intermediary currency that can be canceled out
                          in the equation to obtain the cross-rate. For example, to get a Canada–yen (JPY/CAD)
                          quote, one typically uses the dollar–Canada (CAD/USD) rate and dollar–yen (JPY/
                          USD) rate, which are the market conventions. This Canada–yen calculation requires
                          that the dollar–Canada rate (CAD/USD) be inverted to a Canada–dollar (USD/CAD)
                          quote for the calculations to work, as follows:
                               CAD −1
                              	​(_
                                 ​USD ​)​ ​× _
                                             JPY       USD      JPY       ​USD​   JPY     JPY
                                             ​USD ​ = _
                                                      ​CAD ​× _
                                                              ​USD ​ = _
                                                                       ​CAD ​× _
                                                                               ​​USD​​ = _
                                                                                         ​CAD ​.​

                          Hence, to get a Canada–yen (JPY/CAD) quote, we must first invert the dollar–Canada
                          (CAD/USD) quote before multiplying by the dollar–yen (JPY/USD) quote. Market
                          quotes for most currencies are quoted to four decimal places; however, the Japanese
                          yen exchange rate is quoted to two decimal places. For example, assume that we have
                          spot exchange rates of 1.3020 for dollar–Canada (CAD/USD) and 111.94 for dollar–yen
                          (JPY/USD). The dollar–Canada rate of 1.3020 inverts to 0.7680; multiplying this value
                          by the dollar–yen quote of 111.94 gives the following Canada–yen quote:

Cross-Rate Calculations                                                                   255


   0.7680 × 111.94 = 85.97 JPY per CAD.
Market participants asking for a quote in a cross-rate currency pair typically will not
need to do this calculation themselves: Either the dealer or the electronic trading
platform will provide a quote in the specified currency pair. (For example, a client
asking for a quote in Canada–yen will receive that quote from the dealer; he will not
be given separate dollar–Canada and dollar–yen quotes to do the calculation.) Dealers
providing the quotes often have to do this calculation themselves if only because the
dollar–Canada and dollar–yen currency pairs often trade on different trading desks
and involve different traders. Electronic dealing machines used in both the interbank
market and bank-to-client markets often provide this mathematical operation to
calculate cross-rates automatically.
    Because market participants can receive both a cross-rate quote (e.g., Canada–yen)
as well as the component underlying exchange rate quotes (e.g., dollar–Canada and
dollar–yen), these cross-rate quotes must be consistent with the previous equation;
otherwise, the market will arbitrage the mispricing. Extending our example, we cal-
culate a Canada–yen (JPY/CAD) rate of 85.97 based on underlying dollar–Canada
(CAD/USD) and dollar–yen (JPY/USD) rates of 1.3020 and 111.94, respectively. Now
suppose that at the same time a misguided dealer quotes a Canada–yen rate of 86.20.
This is a different price in Canada–yen for an identical service—that is, converting
yen into Canadian dollars. Hence, any trader could buy CAD1 at the lower price of
JPY85.97and then turn around and sell CAD1 at JPY86.20 (recall our earlier discussion
of how price and base currencies are defined). The riskless arbitrage profit is JPY0.23
per CAD1. The arbitrage—called triangular arbitrage (we use “tri-” because it involves
three currencies—would continue until the price discrepancy was removed.
    In reality, however, these discrepancies in cross-rates rarely occur because both
human traders and automatic trading algorithms are constantly on alert for any pric-
ing inefficiencies. In practice, and for the purposes of this lesson, we can consider
cross-rates as being consistent with their underlying exchange rate quotes and can
assume that given any two exchange rates involving three currencies, we can back
out the third cross-rate.

                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The euro is the base currency in the USD/EUR quote, and
                                the expected decrease in the USD/EUR rate indicates that the euro is
                                depreciating. In one year, it will cost less, in US dollars, to buy one euro.
                                Mathematically:
                                 _  1.1619
                                 	​ 1.1701 ​− 1 = − 0.7%​

                                ciate against the British pound sterling over the next year?
                                 A. +0.6 percent
                                 B. –0.4 percent
                                 C. +0.4 percent
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. The British pound is the base currency in the USD/GBP
                                quote, and the expected decrease in the USD/GBP rate means that the
                                British pound is expected to depreciate against the US dollar. Or equiva-
                                lently, the US dollar is expected to appreciate against the British pound.
                                Mathematically:

                             5. Over the next year, the Swiss franc is expected to:
                                 A. depreciate against the British pound.
                                 B. depreciate against the euro.
                                 C. appreciate against the British pound, euro, and US dollar.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct: Because the question does not require calculating the magni-
                                tude of the appreciation or depreciation, we can use the Swiss franc as either
                                the price currency or the base currency. In this case, it is easier to use the
                                Swiss franc as the price currency. CHF/USD is expected to decline from
                                0.9900 to 0.9866, so the Swiss franc is expected to be stronger (i.e., it should
                                appreciate against the US dollar). CHF/EUR is currently 1.1584 (see the
                       © CFA Institute. For candidate use only. Not for distribution.
Cross-Rate Calculations                                                                 257


     solution to problem 1) and is expected to be 1.1463 (= 0.9866 × 1.1619), so
     the Swiss franc is expected to appreciate against the euro. CHF/GBP is cur-
     rently 1.2987 (= 0.9900 × 1.3118) and is expected to be 1.2891 (= 0.9866 ×
     1.3066), so the Swiss franc is also expected to appreciate against the British
     pound.
     Alternatively, we can derive this answer intuitively. According to the
     research report, the CHF/USD rate is expected to decline: That is, the US
     dollar is expected to depreciate against the Swiss franc, or alternatively, the
     Swiss franc is expected to appreciate against the US dollar. The USD/EUR
     and USD/GBP rates are also decreasing, meaning that the euro and British
     pound are expected to depreciate against the US dollar, or alternatively, the
     US dollar is expected to appreciate against the euro and British pound. If
     the Swiss franc is expected to appreciate against the US dollar and the US
     dollar is expected to appreciate against both the euro and British pound, it
     follows that the Swiss franc is expected to appreciate against both the euro
     and British pound.

  6. Based on the research report, which of the following lists the three curren-
     cies from strongest to weakest over the next year?
      A. US dollar, British pound, euro
      B. US dollar, euro, British pound
      C. Euro, US dollar, British pound
     Solution:
     A is correct. USD/EUR is expected to decline from 1.1701 to 1.1619, while
     USD/GBP is expected to decline from 1.3118 to 1.3066. So, the US dollar is
     expected to be stronger than both the euro and British pound. GBP/EUR
     is currently 0.8920 [= (1.3118)–1 × 1.1701] and is expected to be 0.8893 [=
     (1.3066)–1 × 1.1619], so the British pound is expected to be stronger than
     the euro.

  7. Based on the research report, which of the following lists the three curren-
     cies in order of appreciating the most to appreciating the least (in percent-
     age terms) against the US dollar over the next year?
      A. British pound, Swiss franc, euro
      B. Swiss franc, British pound, euro
      C. Euro, Swiss franc, British pound
     Solution:
     B is correct. The USD/EUR rate depreciates by –0.7 percent (=
     [1.1619/1.1701] – 1), which is the depreciation of the base currency
     euro against the US dollar. The USD/GBP rate declines –0.4 percent (=
     [1.3066/1.3118] – 1), which is the depreciation of the British pound against
     the US dollar. Inverting the CHF/USD rate to a USD/CHF convention shows
     that the base currency Swiss franc appreciates by +0.35 percent against the
     US dollar (= [1.0136/1.0101] – 1).

                                        exchange rates and interest rates, calculate a forward rate using
                                        points or in percentage terms, and interpret a forward discount or

                          This lesson continues the previous discussion of the FX market by considering the
                          interactions between spot and forward rates, interest rates, and maturities, which
                          exist because of arbitrage relationships. The relationships among these four factors
                          are maintained because of market efficiencies, and any one factor can be determined
                          using the other three as inputs. In addition, this lesson covers the methods of calcu-
                          lating forward rates in point and percentage terms as well as forward discounts and
                          premiums for these rate relationships.
                              In professional FX markets, forward exchange rates typically are quoted in terms
                          of points (also sometimes referred to as “pips”). The points on a forward rate quote are
                          simply the difference between the forward exchange rate quote and the spot exchange
                          rate quote, with the points scaled so that they can be related to the last decimal in the
                          spot quote. When the forward rate is higher than the spot rate, the points are positive
                          and the base currency is said to be trading at a forward premium. Conversely, if the
                          forward rate is less than the spot rate, the points (forward rate minus spot rate) are
                          negative and the base currency is said to be trading at a forward discount. Of course, if
                          the base currency is trading at a forward premium, then the price currency is trading
                          at a forward discount, and vice versa.
                              This can best be explained by means of an example. Assume the spot euro–dollar
                          exchange rate (USD/EUR) is 1.15885 and the one-year forward rate is 1.19532. Hence,
                          the forward rate is trading at a premium to the spot rate (the forward rate is larger
                          than the spot rate) and the one-year forward points are quoted as +364.7. This +364.7
                          comes from the following calculation:
                              1.19532 – 1.15885 = +0.03647.
                          Recall that most non-yen exchange rates are quoted to four decimal places. In this
                          case, we would scale up by four decimal places (multiply by 10,000) so that this
                          +0.03647 would be represented as +364.7 points. Notice that the points are scaled to
                          the size of the last digit in the spot exchange rate quote—usually the fourth decimal
                          place. Notice as well that points typically are quoted to one (or more) decimal places,
                          meaning that the forward rate will typically be quoted to five or more decimal places.
                          The exception among the major currencies is the yen, which is typically quoted to
                          two decimal places for spot rates. Here, forward points are scaled up by two decimal
                          places—the last digit in the spot rate quote—by multiplying the difference between
                          forward and spot rates by 100.
                              Typically, quotes for forward rates are shown as the number of forward points at
                          each maturity, the time between spot settlement and the settlement of the forward
                          contract. These forward points are also called swap points because an FX swap con-
                          sists of simultaneous spot and forward transactions. In our example, a trader would
                          have faced a spot rate and forward points in the euro–dollar (USD/EUR) currency
                          pair similar to those in Exhibit 1,

         Maturity                           Spot Rate or Forward Points

         Spot                                           1.15885
         One week                                      +5.6
         One month                                    +27.1
         Three months                                 +80.9
         Six months                                 +175.6
         Twelve months                              +364.7

Notice that the absolute number of points generally increases with maturity. This is
because the number of points is proportional to the yield differential between the
two countries (the Eurozone and the United States, in this case) scaled by the term to
maturity. Given the interest rate differential, the longer the term to maturity, the greater
the absolute number of forward points. Similarly, given the term to maturity, a wider
interest rate differential implies a greater absolute number of forward points. (This
relationship will be explained and demonstrated in more detail later in this lesson.)
    To convert any of these quoted forward points into a forward rate, one would
divide the number of points by 10,000 (to scale down to the fourth decimal place,
the last decimal place in the spot quote) and then add the result to the spot exchange
rate quote. (As mentioned previously, exchange rates for the Japanese yen, such as
the JPY/USD exchange rate, are quoted to two decimal places only, so forward points
for the dollar–yen currency pair are divided by 100.) For example, using the data in
Exhibit 1 for USD/EUR, the three-month forward rate in this case would be as follows:

   	​1.15885 + ( ​10, 000 ​)​ = 1.15885 + 0.00809 = 1.16694​.
                 + 80.9
               ​_

Occasionally, one will see the forward rate or forward points represented as a percentage
of the spot rate rather than as an absolute number of points. Continuing the previous
example, the three-month forward rate for USD/EUR can be represented as follows:

                  ​− 1 = ( ​1.15885 ​)​− 1 = + 0.698%​.
    1.15885 + 0.00809
   ______________             1.16694
     
   	​  1.15885           ​_

This shows that either the forward rate or the forward points can be used to calculate
the percentage discount (or premium) in the forward market—in this case, +0.698
percent rounding to three decimal places. To convert a spot quote into a forward
quote when the points are shown as a percentage, one simply multiplies the spot rate
by one plus the percentage premium or discount:
   1.15885 × (1 + 0.698%) = 1.15885 × (1.0000 + 0.00698) ≈ 1.16694.
Note that, rounded to the fifth decimal place, this is equal to our previous calculation.
However, it is typically the case in professional FX markets that forward rates will be
quoted in terms of pips rather than percentages.


Arbitrage Relationships
We now turn to the interaction between spot rates, forward rates, and interest rates
and how their relationship is derived. Forward exchange rates are based on an arbi-
trage relationship that equates the investment return on two alternative but equivalent
investments. Consider the case of an investor with funds to invest. For simplicity, we
will assume that one unit of the investor’s domestic currency will be invested for one
period. One alternative is to invest for one period at the domestic risk-free rate (rd);
at the end of the period, the amount of funds held is equal to (1 + rd). An alternative

                          investment is to convert this one unit of domestic currency to foreign currency using
                          the spot rate of Sf/d (number of units of foreign currency per one unit of domestic
                          currency). This can be invested for one period at the foreign risk-free rate; at the end of
                          the period, the investor would have Sf/d(1 + rf ) units of foreign currency. These funds
                          must then be converted back to the investor’s domestic currency. If the exchange rate
                          to be used for this end-of-period conversion was pre-contracted at the start of the
                          period (i.e., a forward rate was used), it would eliminate any FX risk from converting
                          at a future, unknown spot rate. Given the assumed exchange rate convention (foreign/
                          domestic), the investor would obtain (1/Ff/d) units of the domestic currency for each
                          unit of foreign currency sold forward. Note that this process of converting domestic
                          funds in the spot FX market, investing at the foreign risk-free rate, and then converting
                          back to the domestic currency with a forward rate is termed “swap financing.”
                              Hence, we have two alternative investments—both are risk free because both are
                          invested at risk-free interest rates and because any FX risk was eliminated (hedged)
                          by using a forward rate. Because these two investments are equal in risk character-
                          istics, they must have the same return. Bearing in mind that the currency quoting
                          convention is the number of foreign currency units per single domestic unit (f/d), this
                          relationship can be stated as follows:

                                                                (​​Ff/d
                                                 ​ ​(1 + r​ ​f​)​ _ ​ ​​)​.
                                                                    1
                              	​(1 + ​r​d​)​ = ​Sf/d

                          This is an arbitrage relationship because it describes two alternative investments
                          (one on either side of the equal sign) that should have equal returns. If they do not, a
                          riskless arbitrage opportunity exists because an investor can sell short the investment
                          with the lower return and invest the funds in the investment with the higher return;
                          the difference between the two returns is pure profit. It is because of this arbitrage
                          relationship that the all-in financing rate using swap financing is close to the domestic
                          interest rate.
                              This formula is perhaps the easiest and most intuitive way to remember the formula
                          for the forward rate because this formula is based directly on the underlying intuition
                          (the arbitrage relationship of two alternative but equivalent investments, one on either
                          side of the equal sign). Also, the right-hand side of the equation, for the hedged foreign
                          investment alternative, is arranged in proper time sequence: (1) convert domestic to
                          foreign currency; then (2) invest the foreign currency at the foreign interest rate; and
                          finally (3) convert the foreign currency back to the domestic currency. Recall that this
                          equation is based on an f/d exchange rate quoting convention. If the exchange rate
                          data were presented in d/f form, one could either invert these quotes back to f/d form
                          and use the previous equation or use the following equivalent equation:
                              (1 + rd) = (1/Sd/f)(1 + rf)Fd/f.
                          If this latter equation were used, remember that forward and spot exchange rates are
                          now being quoted on a d/f convention.
                               This arbitrage equation can be rearranged as needs require. For example, to get
                          the formula for the forward rate, the previous equation can be restated as follows:

                                         ​ ​(_
                                             ​1 + r​ ​ ​)
                                                 1 + ​r​f​
                              	​Ff/d
                                 ​ ​ = ​Sf/d            ​ ​.
                                                       d

                          Given the spot exchange rate and the domestic and foreign risk-free interest rates, the
                          forward rate is the value that completes this equation and eliminates any arbitrage
                          opportunity. For example, let’s assume that the spot exchange rate (Sf/d) is 1.6535, the
                          domestic 12-month risk-free rate is 3.50 percent, and the foreign 12-month risk-free
                          rate is 5.00 percent. The 12-month forward rate (Ff/d) must then be equal to:

                              	​1.6535​(_
                                        ​1.0350 ​)​ = 1.6775​.
                                          1.0500

Forward Rate Calculations                                                                      261


Suppose instead that, with the spot exchange rate and interest rates unchanged, you
were given a quote on the 12-month forward rate (Ff/d) of 1.6900. Because this mis-
quoted forward rate does not agree with the arbitrage equation, it would present a
riskless arbitrage opportunity. This can be calculated by using the arbitrage equation
to compute the return on the two alternative investment strategies. The return on the
domestic-only investment approach is the domestic risk-free rate (3.50 percent). In
contrast, the return on the hedged foreign investment when this misquoted forward
rate is put into the arbitrage equation equals:

                     (​​Ff/d
      ​ ​(1 + r​ ​f​)​ _ ​ ​​)​ = 1.6535​ 1.05 ​(​1.6900 )
                         1                    ) _    1
   	​Sf/d                               (                ​ ​ = 1.0273​.

This results in a return of 2.73 percent. Hence, the investor could make riskless
arbitrage profits by borrowing at the higher foreign risk-free rate, selling the foreign
currency at the spot exchange rate, hedging the currency exposure (buying the for-
eign currency back) at the misquoted forward rate, investing the funds at the lower
domestic risk-free rate, and thereby getting a profit of 77 basis points (3.50% – 2.73%)
for each unit of domestic currency involved—all with no upfront commitment of the
investor’s own capital. Any such opportunity in real-world financial markets would be
quickly “arbed” away. In this example, the investor actually borrows at the higher of
the two interest rates but makes a profit because the foreign currency is underpriced
in the forward market.
    The underlying arbitrage equation can also be rearranged to show the forward
rate as a percentage of the spot rate:

   	​ ​S​ ​​ = ( ​1 + ​r​ ​​)​.
   _  ​Ff/d
        ​ ​       1 + ​r​f​
               ​_
        f/d             d

This shows that, given an f/d quoting convention, the forward rate will be higher than
(be at a premium to) the spot rate if foreign interest rates are higher than domestic
interest rates. More generally, and regardless of the quoting convention, the currency
with the higher (lower) interest rate will always trade at a discount (premium) in the
forward market.
    One context in which forward rates are quoted as a percentage of spot rates occurs
when forward rates are interpreted as expected future spot rates, as follows:
   	​Ft​​ = ​St+1
              ​ ​.
Substituting this expression into the previous equation and doing some rearranging
leads to the following:

                       ​ ​= ( ​1 + r​ ​ ​)
   _ ​St+1
       ​ ​                     ​r​f​− ​r​d​
   	​ ​S​​ ​− 1 = %Δ ​St+1  ​_            ​ ​.​
        t                               d

This shows that if forward rates are interpreted as expected future spot rates, the
expected percentage change in the spot rate is proportional to the interest rate dif-
ferential (rf – rd).
    It is intuitively appealing to see forward rates as expected future spot rates. However,
this interpretation of forward rates should be used cautiously. The direction of the
expected change in spot rates is somewhat counterintuitive. All else being equal, an
increase in domestic interest rates (e.g., the central bank tightens monetary policy)
would typically be expected to lead to an increase in the value of the domestic currency.
In contrast, the previous equation indicates that, all else equal, a higher domestic inter-
est rate implies slower expected appreciation (or greater expected depreciation) of the
domestic currency (recall that this equation is based on an f/d quoting convention).
    More important, historical data show that forward rates are poor predictors of
future spot rates. Although various econometric studies suggest that forward rates may
be unbiased predictors of future spot rates (i.e., they do not systematically over- or
under-estimate future spot rates), this is not particularly useful information because

                          the margin of error for these forecasts is so large. As mentioned in the Introduction,
                          the FX market is far too complex and dynamic to be captured by a single variable,
                          such as the level of the yield differential between countries. Moreover, according to the
                          formula for the forward rate, forward rates are based on domestic and foreign interest
                          rates. This means that anything that affects the level and shape of the yield curve in
                          either the domestic or foreign market will also affect the relationship between spot
                          and forward exchange rates. In other words, FX markets do not operate in isolation
                          but rather reflect almost all factors affecting other markets globally; anything that
                          affects expectations or risk premia in these other markets will reverberate in forward
                          exchange rates as well. Although the level of the yield differential is one factor that
                          the market may look at in forming spot exchange rate expectations, it is only one of
                          many factors. (Many traders look to the trend in the yield differential rather than the
                          level of the differential.) Moreover, a lot of noise in FX markets makes almost any
                          model—no matter how complex—a relatively poor predictor of spot rates at any given
                          point in the future. In practice, FX traders and market strategists do not base either
                          their currency expectations or trading strategies solely on forward rates.
                              For the purposes of this lesson, it is best to understand forward exchange rates
                          simply as a product of the arbitrage equation outlined earlier and forward points as
                          being related to the (time-scaled) interest rate differential between the two countries.
                          Reading any more than that into forward rates or interpreting them as the “market
                          forecast” can be potentially misleading.


                          Forward Discounts and Premiums
                          We now continue our discussion of forward discounts and premiums based on spot
                          and interest rates and add the impact of maturity. To understand the relationship
                          between maturity and forward points, we need to generalize our arbitrage formula
                          slightly. Suppose the investment horizon is a fraction, τ, of the period for which
                          the interest rates are quoted. Then the interest earned in the domestic and foreign
                          markets would be (rd τ) and (rf τ), respectively. Substituting this into our arbitrage
                          relationship and solving for the difference between the forward and spot exchange
                          rates gives the following:

                                                ​ ​(_
                                                    1​ + ​r​ ​τ ​)​τ​.
                                                             ​r​f​− ​r​d​
                              	​Ff/d
                                 ​ ​− ​Sf/d
                                        ​ ​ = ​Sf/d
                                                                    d

                          This equation shows that forward points (appropriately scaled) are proportional to
                          the spot exchange rate and to the interest rate differential and approximately (but not
                          exactly) proportional to the horizon of the forward contract.
                              For example, suppose that we wanted to determine the 30-day forward exchange
                          rate given a 30-day domestic risk-free interest rate of 2.00 percent per year, a 30-day
                          foreign risk-free interest rate of 3.00 percent per year, and a spot exchange rate (Sf/d)
                          of 1.6555. The risk-free assets used in this arbitrage relationship are typically bank
                          deposits quoted using the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) for the currencies
                          involved. The day count convention for Libor deposits is actual/360. Incorporating
                          the fractional period (τ) and inserting the data into the forward rate equation leads
                          to the following 30-day forward rate:
                                                                            1 + 0.0300​[_

                                                                                          30

                                                                                  ​360 ​]​)
                                                1 + ​r​f​τ             ____________

                                                    d


                          This means that, for a 30-day term, forward rates are trading at a premium of 14 pips
                          (1.6569 – 1.6555). This can also be calculated using the previous formula for swap
                          points:

                                                ​ ​(_

                                                                             ( 1 + 0.0200​[​360 ]​ ​) 360
                                                                                             30 ​ ​[​     ​]​ = 0.0014​.
                                                                                     0.0300 − 0.0200
                                                                               ____________ _          30

                                 ​ ​− ​Sf/d
                                        ​ ​ = ​Sf/d                            ​           _

As should be clear from this expression, the absolute number of swap points will be
closely related to the term of the forward contract (i.e., approximately proportional to τ
= actual/360). For example, leaving the spot exchange rate and interest rates unchanged,
and setting the term of the forward contract to 180 days, we obtain the following:

                         ( 1 + 0.0200​[​360 ​]​)
                                        180 ​ ​[​360 ​]​ = 0.0082​.
                            0.0300 − 0.0200     180
      ​ ​− ​Sf/d
   	​Ff/d    ​ ​ = 1.6555​ ____________
                             
                           ​           _
                                                 _


This leads to the forward rate trading at a premium of 82 pips. The increase in the
number of forward points is approximately proportional to the increase in the term
of the contract (from 30 days to 180 days). Note that although the term of the 180-day
forward contract is six times longer than that of a 30-day contract, the number of
forward points is not exactly six times larger: 6 × 14 = 84.
    Similarly, the number of forward points is proportional to the spread between
foreign and domestic interest rates (rf – rd). For example, with reference to the original
30-day forward contract, let’s set the foreign interest rate to 4.00 percent leaving the
domestic interest rate and spot exchange rate unchanged. This doubles the interest
rate differential (rf – rd) from 1.00 percent to 2.00 percent; it also doubles the forward
points (rounding to four decimal places), as follows:

                         ( 1 + 0.0200​[​360 ​]​) 360
                                        30 ​ ​[​     ​]​ = 0.0028​.

EXAMPLE 2

   Forward Rate Calculations
   A French company recently finalized a sale of goods to a UK-based client and
   expects to receive a payment of GBP50 million in 32 days. The corporate trea-
   surer at the French company wants to hedge the FX risk of this transaction and
   receives the following exchange rate information from a dealer:
                                                 ​




         GBP/EUR spot rate                    0.8752
         One-month forward points             –1.4
                                                 ​




   1. According to the exchange rate information, the treasurer could hedge the
      FX risk by:
      A. buying euro (selling British pounds) at a forward rate of 0.87380.
      B. buying euro (selling British pounds) at a forward rate of 0.87506.
       C. selling euro (buying British pounds) at a forward rate of 0.87506.
      Solution:
      B is correct. The French company would want to convert the British pound
      to its domestic currency, the euro (it wants to sell British pounds and
      buy euros). The forward rate would be equal to: 0.8752 + (–1.4/10,000) =
      0.87506.

   2. According to the exchange rate information, the best interpretation of the
      forward discount shown is that:
      A. the euro is expected to depreciate over the next 30 days.
      B. one-month UK interest rates are higher than those in the Eurozone.

                                 C. one-month Eurozone interest rates are higher than those in the United
                                    Kingdom.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. A forward discount indicates that interest rates in the base
                                currency country (France, in this case, which uses the euro) are higher than
                                those in the price currency country (the United Kingdom).

                             3. According to the exchange rate information, if the 12-month forward rate is
                                0.87295 GBP/EUR, then the 12-month forward points are closest to:
                                 A. –22.5.
                                 B. –2.25.
                                 C. –0.00225.
                                Solution:
                                A is correct. The number of forward points is equal to the scaled difference
                                between the forward rate and the spot rate. In this case: 0.87295 – 0.87520
                                = –0.00225. This is then multiplied by 10,000 to convert to the number of
                                forward points.

                             4. If a second dealer quotes GBP/EUR at a 12-month forward discount of 0.30
                                percent on the same spot rate, the French company could:
                                 A. trade with either dealer because the 12-month forward quotes are
                                    equivalent.
                                 B. lock in a profit in 12 months by buying euros from the second dealer
                                    and selling it to the original dealer.
                                 C. lock in a profit in 12 months by buying euros from the original dealer
                                    and selling it to the second dealer.
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. A 0.30 percent discount means that the second dealer will sell
                                euros 12 months forward at 0.8752 × (1 – 0.0030) = 0.87257, a lower price
                                per euro than the original dealer’s quote of 0.87295. Buying euros at the
                                cheaper 12-month forward rate (0.87257) and selling the same amount of
                                euros 12 months forward at the higher 12-month forward rate (0.87295)
                                means a profit of (0.87295 – 0.87257 = GBP0.00038) per euro transacted,
                                receivable when both forward contracts settle in 12 months.

                             5. If the 270-day Libor rates (annualized) for the euro and British pound
                                are 1.370 percent and 1.325 percent, respectively, and the spot GBP/EUR
                                exchange rate is 0.8489, then the number of forward points for a 270-day
                                forward rate (FGBP/EUR) is closest to:
                                 A. –22.8.
                                 B. –3.8.
                                 C. –2.8.
                                Solution:
                                C is correct, because the forward rate is calculated as:

                          1. The spot ZAR/HKD cross-rate is closest to:
                              A. 0.9205.

                              B. 1.0864.

                          2. Another dealer is quoting the ZAR/SEK cross-rate at 1.1210. The arbitrage profit
                             that can be earned is closest to:
                              A. ZAR3671 per million Swedish krona traded.

                              B. SEK4200 per million South African rand traded.

                              C. ZAR4200 per million Swedish krona traded.


                          3. A BRL/MXN spot rate is listed by a dealer at 0.1378. The six-month forward rate
                             is 0.14193. The six-month forward points are closest to:
                              A. –41.3.

                              B. +41.3.

                              C. +299.7.

                          4. A three-month forward exchange rate in CAD/USD is listed by a dealer at 1.0123.
                             The dealer also quotes three-month forward points as a percentage at 6.8 per-
                             cent. The CAD/USD spot rate is closest to:
                              A. 0.9478.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. A is correct. To get to the ZAR/HKD cross-rate, it is necessary to take the inverse
                             of the CNY/ZAR spot rate and then multiply by the CNY/HKD exchange rate:

                              ZAR/HKD = ​(CNY/ZAR)​−1​× (​ CNY/HKD)​
                                  
                              	​                                   ​
                              = (​ 1 / 0.9149)​× 0.8422 = 0.9205

                          2. C is correct. The ZAR/SEK cross-rate from the original dealer is (1.0218/0.9149)
                             = 1.1168, which is lower than the quote from the second dealer. To earn an arbi-
                             trage profit, a currency trader would buy Swedish krona (sell South African rand)
                             from the original dealer and sell Swedish krona (buy South African rand) to the
                             second dealer. On SEK1 million, the profit would be:
                              SEK1,000,000 × (1.1210 – 1.1168) = ZAR4,200

                          3. B is correct. The number of forward points equals the forward rate minus the
                             spot rate, or 0.14193 – 0.1378 = 0.00413, multiplied by 10,000: 10,000 × 0.00413=
                             41.3 points. By convention, forward points are scaled so that ±1 forward point
                             corresponds to a change of ±1 in the last decimal place of the spot exchange rate.

                          4. A is correct. Given the forward rate and forward points as a percentage, the un-
                             known in the calculation is the spot rate. The calculation is as follows:
                              Spot rate × (1 + Forward points as a percentage) = Forward rate

                              Spot rate × (1 + 0.068) = 1.0123

                              Spot = 1.0123/1.068 = 0.9478

                          5. B is correct. The base currency trading at a forward discount means that 1 unit
                             of the base currency costs less for forward delivery than for spot delivery (i.e., the
                             forward exchange rate is less than the spot exchange rate). The forward points,
                             expressed either as an absolute number of points or as a percentage, are negative.

                          6. C is correct. To eliminate arbitrage opportunities, the spot exchange rate (S),
                             the forward exchange rate (F), the interest rate in the base currency (rd, and the
                             interest rate in the price currency (rf ) must satisfy:
                              Ff/d/ Sf/d = (1+rfτ / 1+rdτ).
                              According to this formula, the base currency will trade at forward premium (F >
                              S) if, and only if, the interest rate in the price currency is higher than the interest
                              rate in the base currency (rf > rd).

                          7. B is correct. The forward exchange rate is given by:

                                                                               1 + 0.0015​[_
                                                                                           ​360 ​]​
                                                                                              90

                                                                                             ​360 ​]​)

                                                       _                          ____________

                              	​= 82.42 × 0.98815 = 81.443.​
                              The forward points are as follows:
                              100 × (F × S) = 100 × (81.443 – 82.42) = 100 × (–0.977) = –97.7.
                              Because the spot exchange rate is quoted with two decimal places, the forward
                              points are scaled by 100.
