                                   How to Use the CFA
                                  Program Curriculum
The CFA® Program exams measure your mastery of the core knowledge, skills, and
abilities required to succeed as an investment professional. These core competencies
are the basis for the Candidate Body of Knowledge (CBOK™). The CBOK consists of
four components:
       A broad outline that lists the major CFA Program topic areas (www​
       .cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok/​cbok)
       Topic area weights that indicate the relative exam weightings of the top-level
       topic areas (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum)
       Learning outcome statements (LOS) that advise candidates about the
       specific knowledge, skills, and abilities they should acquire from curricu-
       lum content covering a topic area: LOS are provided at the beginning of
       each block of related content and the specific lesson that covers them. We
       encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website
       (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​study​-sessions), including
       the descriptions of LOS “command words” on the candidate resources page
       at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​-/​media/​documents/​support/​programs/​cfa​-and​
       -cipm​-los​-command​-words​.ashx.
       The CFA Program curriculum that candidates receive access to upon exam
       registration
    Therefore, the key to your success on the CFA exams is studying and understanding
the CBOK. You can learn more about the CBOK on our website: www​.cfainstitute​
.org/​programs/​cfa/​curriculum/​cbok.
    The curriculum, including the practice questions, is the basis for all exam questions.
The curriculum is selected or developed specifically to provide candidates with the
knowledge, skills, and abilities reflected in the CBOK.




CFA INSTITUTE LEARNING ECOSYSTEM (LES)
Your exam registration fee includes access to the CFA Institute Learning Ecosystem
(LES). This digital learning platform provides access, even offline, to all the curriculum
content and practice questions. The LES is organized as a series of learning modules
consisting of short online lessons and associated practice questions. This tool is your
source for all study materials, including practice questions and mock exams. The LES
is the primary method by which CFA Institute delivers your curriculum experience.
Here, candidates will find additional practice questions to test their knowledge. Some
questions in the LES provide a unique interactive experience.




DESIGNING YOUR PERSONAL STUDY PROGRAM
An orderly, systematic approach to exam preparation is critical. You should dedicate
a consistent block of time every week to reading and studying. Review the LOS both
before and after you study curriculum content to ensure you can demonstrate the
xii                                                    How to Use the CFA Program Curriculum


      knowledge, skills, and abilities described by the LOS and the assigned reading. Use
      the LOS as a self-check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for
      later review.
          Successful candidates report an average of more than 300 hours preparing for each
      exam. Your preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience,
      and you will likely spend more time on some topics than on others.




      ERRATA
      The curriculum development process is rigorous and involves multiple rounds of
      reviews by content experts. Despite our efforts to produce a curriculum that is free of
      errors, in some instances, we must make corrections. Curriculum errata are periodically
      updated and posted by exam level and test date on the Curriculum Errata webpage
      (www​.cfainstitute​.org/​en/​programs/​submit​-errata). If you believe you have found an
      error in the curriculum, you can submit your concerns through our curriculum errata
      reporting process found at the bottom of the Curriculum Errata webpage.

            1           INTRODUCTION
                        Financial analysis is the process of interpreting and evaluating a company’s performance
                        and position in the context of its economic environment. Financial analysis is used
                        by analysts to make decisions and recommendations such as whether to invest in a
                        company’s debt or equity securities and at what price. A debt investor is concerned
                        about a company’s ability to pay interest and to repay the principal lent, while an
                        equity investor is interested in a company’s profitability and per-share value. Overall,
                        a central focus of financial analysis is evaluating the company’s ability to earn a return
                        on its capital that is at least equal to the cost of that capital, to profitably grow its
                        operations, and to generate enough cash to meet obligations and pursue opportunities.
                            Financial analysis starts with the information found in a company’s financial reports.
                        These financial reports include audited financial statements, additional disclosures
                        required by regulatory authorities, and any accompanying (unaudited) commentary by
                        management. Analysts supplement their analysis of a company’s financial statements
                        with industry and company research.

                           LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                               ■   Financial analysis for a company often includes obtaining an
                                   understanding of the target company’s business model, finan-
                                   cial performance, financial position, and broader information about
                                   the economic environment and the industry in which the company
                                   operates. When analytical tasks are not well defined, the analyst
                                   may need to make decisions about the approach, the tools, the data
                                   sources, the format for reporting the results, and the relative impor-
                                   tance of different aspects of the analysis.
                               ■   Financial analysis will include evaluating financial results, and struc-
                                   turing and scaling data to facilitate comparisons by calculating
                                   percentages, changes, and ratios. Answers to analytical questions
                                   often rely not just on numerical results but also on the analyst’s
                                   interpretation of the numerical results to support a conclusion or
                                   recommendation.
                               ■   The role of financial statement analysis is to form expectations about
                                   a company’s future performance, financial position, and risk factors
                                   for the purpose of making investment, credit, and other economic
                                   decisions.
                               ■   · Regulatory authorities require publicly traded companies to prepare
                                   financial reports in accordance with specified accounting standards
                                   and other securities laws and regulations. An example of such a reg-
                                   ulatory authority is the Securities and Exchange Commission in the
                                   United States.
                               ■   Other organizations exist without explicit regulatory authority and
                                   develop reporting standards, facilitate cooperation, and advise govern-
                                   ments. Examples include the International Organization of Securities
                                   Commissions, the European Securities Committee, and the European
                                   Securities and Market Authority.
                               ■   Sources of information for analysts and investors include standard-
                                   ized forms that are filed with regulatory authorities, disclosures made
                                   in notes, supplementary schedules, and management commentary
                                   that accompany financial statements, and audit reports. In an audit
                                   report, an independent auditor expresses an opinion on whether the

          information in the audited financial statements fairly presents the
          financial position, performance, and cash flows of the company in
          accordance with a specified set of accounting standards.
      ■   Despite increasing convergence over time, differences still exist
          between IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) and US
          GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) that affect financial
          reporting. Analysts must be aware of areas where accounting stan-
          dards have not converged.
      ■   In addition to information required by regulatory authorities, issuers
          also communicate through earnings calls, investor day events, press
          releases, company websites, and company visits. Analysts may also
          get information by speaking with management, investor relations, and
          other company personnel.
      ■   Third-party sources for additional information include industry white-
          papers, analyst reports, economic information from governments,
          general and industry-specific news outlets, and electronic data plat-
          forms. Analysts also use surveys, conversations, and product evalua-
          tions to generate their own information.




FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
                                                                                          2
              describe the steps in the financial statement analysis framework

Analysts work in a variety of positions within the investment management industry.
Some are equity analysts whose main objective is to evaluate potential investments
in a company’s equity securities as a basis for deciding whether a prospective invest-
ment is attractive and what an appropriate purchase price might be. Others are credit
analysts who evaluate the creditworthiness of a company to decide whether (and
on what terms) a debt investment should be made or what credit rating should be
assigned. Analysts may also be involved in a variety of other tasks, such as evaluating
the performance of a subsidiary company, evaluating a private equity investment, or
finding stocks that are overvalued for purposes of taking a short position.
    Exhibit 1 presents a generic framework for financial statement analysis used in
these various roles.

                                     The following sections discuss the individual phases of financial statement analysis.


                                     Articulate the Purpose and Context of the Analysis
                                     Before undertaking any analysis, it is essential to understand the purpose of the analysis.
                                     An understanding of the purpose is particularly important in financial statement anal-
                                     ysis because of the numerous available techniques and the substantial amount of data.
                                         Some analytical tasks are well defined, in which case articulating the purpose of
                                     the analysis requires little decision making by the analyst. For example, a periodic
                                     credit review of an investment-grade debt portfolio or an equity analyst’s quarterly
                                     report on a particular company may be guided by institutional norms such that the
                                     purpose of the analysis is given. Furthermore, the format, procedures, or sources of
                                     information may also be given.
                                         For other analytical tasks, articulating the purpose of the analysis requires the
                                     analyst to make decisions about the approach, the tools, the data sources, the format
                                     in which to report the results of the analysis, and the relative importance of different
                                     aspects of the analysis.

    When facing a substantial amount of data, a less experienced analyst may be
tempted to start calculating ratios without considering what is relevant for the decision
at hand. It is generally advisable to resist this temptation and thus avoid unnecessary
or pointless efforts. Consider the questions: If you could have all the calculations and
ratios completed instantly, what question would you be able to answer? What decision
would your answer support?
    The analyst should also define the context at this stage. Who is the intended
audience? What is the deliverable—for example, a final report explaining conclusions
and recommendations? What is the time frame (i.e., when is the report due)? What
resources and resource constraints are relevant to completion of the analysis? Again,
the context may be predefined (i.e., standard and guided by institutional norms).
    Having clarified the purpose and context of the financial statement analysis, the
analyst should next compile the specific questions to be answered by the analysis. For
example, if the purpose of the financial statement analysis (or, more likely, a stage of a
larger analysis) is to compare the historical performance of three companies operating
in a particular industry, specific questions would include the following: What has been
the relative growth rate of the companies, and what has been their relative profitability?


Collect Data
Next, the analyst obtains information required to answer the specific questions. A
key part of this step is obtaining an understanding of the target company’s business
model, financial performance, and financial position (including trends over time and
relative to peer companies). Financial statement data alone may be adequate in some
cases. For example, to screen a large number of companies to find those with a min-
imum level of historical profitability or sales growth, financial statement data alone
would be adequate. But to address more in-depth questions, such as why and how
one company performed better or worse than its competitors, additional information
would be required.
    Furthermore, information on the economy and industry is necessary to understand
the environment in which the company operates. Analysts often take a top-down
approach whereby they (1) gain an understanding of an issuer’s macroeconomic
environment, such as prospects for growth in the economy and inflation; (2) analyze
the prospects of the industry in which the company operates, based on the expected
macroeconomic environment; and (3) determine the prospects for the company given
the expected industry and macroeconomic environments. For example, an analyst
may need to forecast future growth in earnings for a company. Past company data
provide the platform for statistical forecasting; however, an understanding of economic
and industry conditions and an outlook for them can improve the analyst’s ability to
make forecasts.


Process Data
After obtaining the requisite financial and other information, the analyst processes
these data using appropriate analytical tools. For example, processing the data may

                        analyses; or using any other analytical tools or combination of tools that are available
                        and appropriate for the task. A comprehensive financial analysis at this stage may
                        include the following:
                           ■   Reading and evaluating financial results for each company being analyzed.
                               This includes understanding any factors that may affect comparability
                               between companies, such as differences in business models, operating deci-
                               sions (e.g., leasing versus purchasing fixed assets), accounting policies (e.g.,
                               when to report revenue on the income statement), and tax jurisdictions.
                           ■   Making any needed adjustments to the financial statements or using alterna-
                               tive measures to facilitate comparison. Note that commonly used databases
                               do not always make such analyst adjustments.
                           ■   Preparing or collecting common-size financial statement data (which scale
                               data to directly reflect percentages [e.g., of sales] or changes [e.g., from the
                               prior year]) and financial ratios (which are measures of various aspects of
                               corporate performance based on financial statement elements. Analysts can
                               use these to evaluate a company’s relative profitability, liquidity, leverage,
                               efficiency, and valuation in relation to past results or peers.


                        Analyze/Interpret the Data
                        Once the data have been processed, the next step—critical to any analysis—is to inter-
                        pret the output. The answer to a specific question is seldom the numerical answer alone.
                        Rather, the answer relies on the analyst’s interpretation of the output, and the use of
                        this interpreted output to support a conclusion or recommendation. The answers to
                        the specific analytical questions may themselves achieve the underlying purpose of
                        the analysis, but usually, a conclusion or recommendation is required. For example,
                        an equity analysis may involve forecasts of earnings, free cash flow, and a range of
                        fair value estimates that would be used to issue a buy, hold, or sell recommendation.
                        A credit analyst may also create forecasts of free cash flow, interest coverage, and
                        leverage in support of an investment decision.


                        Develop and Communicate Conclusions and
                        Recommendations
                        Communicating the conclusion or recommendation in an appropriate format is the
                        next step. The appropriate format will vary by analytical task, by institution, or by
                        audience. For example, an equity analyst’s report for external distribution would
                        typically include the following components:
                           ■   summary and investment conclusion;
                           ■   industry overview and competitive analysis;
                           ■   financial statement model, potentially with several scenarios;
                           ■   valuation; and
                           ■   investment risks.
                            The contents of reports may also be specified by regulatory agencies or profes-
                        sional standards. For example, the CFA Institute Standards of Practice Handbook
                        (Handbook) dictates standards that must be followed in communicating recommen-
                        dations. According to the Handbook:
                               Standard V(B) states that members and candidates should communicate
                               in a recommendation the factors that were instrumental in making the
                               investment recommendation. A critical part of this requirement is to

        distinguish clearly between opinions and facts. In preparing a research
        report, the member or candidate must present the basic characteristics
        of the security(ies) being analyzed, which will allow the reader to evaluate
        the report and incorporate information the reader deems relevant to his
        or her investment decision making process.1
    The Handbook requires that limitations to the analysis and any risks inherent to
the investment be disclosed. Furthermore, it requires that any report include elements
important to the analysis and conclusions so that readers can evaluate the conclusions
themselves.


Follow-Up
The process does not end with the report. If an equity investment is made or a credit
rating is assigned, periodic review is required to revise forecasts and recommenda-
tions based on the receipt of new information. In the case of a rejected investment,
subsequent analyses may still be required should the security price or business con-
ditions change. Follow-up may involve repeating all the previous steps in the process
on a periodic basis.




SCOPE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS
                                                                                                 3
                describe the roles of financial statement analysis

The role of financial statement analysis is to use financial reports prepared by com-
panies, combined with other information, to evaluate the past, current, and potential
performance and financial position of a company for the purpose of making investment,
credit, and other economic decisions. Managers within a company perform financial
analysis to make operating, investing, and financing decisions but do not exclusively
rely on analysis of related financial statements because they have access to nonpublic
financial information.
    In evaluating financial reports, analysts typically have a specific economic decision
in mind. Examples of these decisions include the following:
    ■   Evaluating an equity investment for inclusion in a portfolio.
    ■   Valuing a security for making an investment recommendation to others.
    ■   Determining the creditworthiness of a company to decide whether to extend
        a loan to the company and if so, what terms to offer.
    ■   Assigning a debt rating to a company or bond issue.
    ■   Deciding whether to make a venture capital or other private equity
        investment.
    ■   Evaluating a merger or acquisition candidate.
    These decisions demonstrate certain themes in financial analysis. In general,
analysts seek to examine the past and current performance and financial position of
a company to form expectations about its future performance and financial position.
Analysts are also concerned about factors that affect the risks to a company’s future
performance and financial position. An examination of performance can include an

                         goods and services) and its ability to generate positive cash flows (cash receipts in
                         excess of cash disbursements).
                             Exhibit 2 shows how news coverage of corporate earnings announcements places

                         Earnings are also frequently used by analysts in valuation. For example, an analyst
                         may value shares of a company by comparing its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) to the
                         P/Es of peer companies or may use forecasted future earnings as direct or indirect
                         inputs into discounted cash flow models of valuation.

   Mixed Results, Suspends Revenue Guidance
   Singapore-based Sea Limited (SE) reported second-quarter results early Tuesday
   that missed on revenue but beat on earnings. The company, however, said it
   will suspend guidance for its e-commerce unit, which accounts for about 60%
   of company revenue.
        The company reported revenue of $2.9 billion, missing estimates of $2.98
   billion. It lost 61 cents a share, better than the estimated loss of $1.14 a share,
   according to FactSet.
        SE stock plunged 14.3% during afternoon action on the stock market today.
        Sea has one of the largest e-commerce and digital entertainment platforms
   in the Southeast Asia region. It also provides financial services.
        The company said its decision to suspend revenue guidance was driven by
   a highly volatile and unpredictable macro environment.
        "We think the right thing to do in this time of continuing heightened macro
   volatility is to prioritize efficiency and self-sufficiency," Chief Executive Forrest
   Li said in written remarks in the Sea Limited earnings report.
        Sea's gaming unit, called Garena, accounts for about 31% of revenue.
        "We are in an environment of increased macro uncertainty, with rising infla-
   tion, rising interest rates, local currency depreciations against the U.S. dollar,
   and ongoing reopening trends," said Li. "In this environment, being agile and
   adaptable is even more crucial to the long-term success of our business."
        SE stock is down about 62% this year.

                         assigned the Company a BBB- with positive outlook. This follows the company
                         securing a Baa3 rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s and a BBB- rating
                         with a positive outlook from Fitch.
                             This full investment grade rating comes as a result of T-Mobile’s successful
                         operational and financial performance, which is consistently demonstrated
                         through strong subscriber growth and the company’s ability to translate that
                         into increasing free cash flow.
                             “Achieving a full investment grade rating is an important milestone for
                         T-Mobile that reflects the leading credit rating agencies’ positive outlook on

                         access to the deep investment grade debt markets, which will further fuel our
                         growth and momentum toward our mission of being the very best at connecting
                         customers to their world.”

                             New York, July 20, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded
                         T-Mobile USA, Inc.'s (T-Mobile) senior unsecured debt rating to Baa3 from Ba2
                         and affirmed the Baa3 rating on the company's existing senior secured notes

                             Moody's has also withdrawn T-Mobile's Ba1 corporate family rating, Ba1-PD
                         probability of default rating and SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating. With
                         this rating action, Moody's changed T-Mobile's ratings outlook to stable from
                         positive.
                             The ratings upgrade reflects T-Mobile's accelerated achievement of higher
                         than expected operating cost synergies following its April 2020 merger with

    In conducting financial analysis of a company, the analyst will regularly refer to
the company’s financial statements, financial notes, and supplementary schedules as
well as a variety of other information sources. The next lesson introduces commonly
used information sources.




REGULATED SOURCES OF INFORMATION
                                                                                                              4

                 and audit reports

Regulatory authorities require publicly traded issuers to prepare financial reports in
accordance with specified accounting standards and other securities laws and regula-
tions. For example, in Switzerland, Swiss-based companies listed on the main board
of the Swiss Exchange must prepare their financial statements in accordance with
either IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP (Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles) if they are multinational. 2 While jurisdictions differ
in their approach to securities regulations and corporate reporting standards, regu-
lators of jurisdictions that oversee more than 95 percent of world’s financial markets
are members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
and share objectives and principles, thereby creating a degree of global uniformity.


International Organization of Securities Commissions
Although technically not a regulatory authority, IOSCO regulates a significant portion
of the world’s financial capital markets. This organization was formed in 1983 and
consists of ordinary members, associate members, and affiliate members. Ordinary
members are the securities commission or similar governmental regulatory authority
with primary responsibility for securities regulation in the member country.3 The
members regulate more than 95 percent of the world’s financial capital markets in
more than 115 jurisdictions, and securities regulators in emerging markets account
for 75 percent of its ordinary membership.
    IOSCO’s comprehensive set of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation is
updated as required and is recognized as an international benchmark for all markets.
The principles of securities regulation are based upon three core objectives:4
    ■    protecting investors;
    ■    ensuring that markets are fair, efficient, and transparent; and
    ■    reducing systemic risk.

                             IOSCO’s principles are grouped into 10 categories, including principles for reg-
                         ulators, for enforcement, for auditing, and for issuers, among others. Within the
                         category “Principles for Issuers,” two principles relate directly to financial reporting:
                             ■   There should be full, accurate, and timely disclosure of financial results, risk,
                                 and other information that is material to investors’ decisions.
                             ■   Accounting standards used by issuers to prepare financial statements should
                                 be of a high and internationally acceptable quality.
                             Historically, regulation and related financial reporting standards were developed
                         within individual countries and were often based on the cultural, economic, and
                         political norms of each country. As financial markets have become more global, it has
                         become desirable to establish comparable financial reporting standards internationally.
                         Ultimately, laws and regulations are established by individual jurisdictions, so this also
                         requires cooperation among regulators. Another IOSCO principle deals with the use
                         of self-regulatory organizations (SROs), which exercise some direct oversight for their
                         areas of competence and should be subject to the oversight of the relevant regulator
                         and observe fairness and confidentiality.5
                             To ensure consistent application of international financial standards (such as the
                         Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s standards and IFRS), it is important to
                         have uniform regulation and enforcement across national boundaries. IOSCO assists
                         in attaining this goal of uniform regulation as well as cross-border cooperation in
                         combating violations of securities and derivatives laws.


                         US Securities and Exchange Commission
                         The US SEC has primary responsibility for securities and capital markets regulation in
                         the United States and is an ordinary member of IOSCO. Any company issuing secu-
                         rities within the United States (e.g., on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ),
                         or otherwise involved in US capital markets, is subject to the rules and regulations
                         of the SEC. The SEC, one of the oldest and most developed regulatory authorities,
                         was created by reforms after the stock market crash of 1929 that preceded the Great
                         Depression.
                             From a financial reporting and analysis perspective, the most significant statutes
                         enforced by the SEC are the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934 and the Sarbanes–Oxley
                         Act of 2002.
                             ■   Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act): This law specifies the financial and
                                 other significant information that investors must receive when securities
                                 are sold, prohibits misrepresentations, and requires initial registration of all
                                 public issuances of securities.
                             ■   Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act): This law created the
                                 SEC, gave the SEC authority over all aspects of the securities industry, and
                                 empowered the SEC to require periodic reporting by companies with pub-
                                 licly traded securities.
                             ■   Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002: This law created the Public Company
                                 Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to oversee auditors. The SEC is
                                 responsible for carrying out the requirements of the act and overseeing
                                 the PCAOB. The act addresses auditor independence (it prohibits auditors
                                 from providing certain non-audit services to the companies they audit);
                                 strengthens corporate responsibility for financial reports (it requires
                                 executive management to certify that the company’s financial reports fairly
                                 present the company’s condition); and requires management to report on

       the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting
       (including obtaining external auditor confirmation of the effectiveness of
       internal control).
     Companies comply with these acts principally through filing standardized forms
created by the SEC and by responding to and complying with specific comments on
their filings by the SEC staff. More than 50 different types of SEC forms are used to
satisfy reporting requirements; the discussion herein is limited to those forms most
relevant for financial analysts.
     Most of the SEC filings are required to be made electronically, so filings that an
analyst would be interested in can be retrieved online from one of many websites,
including an issuer’s investor relations website and the SEC’s own website. Some
filings are required on the initial offering of securities, whereas others are required
on a periodic basis thereafter. The following are some of the more common filings
used by analysts.
   ■   Securities Offerings Registration Statement: The 1933 Act requires
       companies offering securities to file a registration statement. New issuers as
       well as previously registered companies that are issuing new securities are
       required to file these statements. Required information and the precise form
       vary depending upon the size and nature of the offering. Typically, required
       information includes (1) disclosures about the securities being offered for
       sale, (2) the relationship of these new securities to the issuer’s other capi-
       tal securities, (3) the information typically provided in the annual filings,
       (4) recent audited financial statements, and (5) risk factors involved in the
       business. Interim unaudited financial statements are also provided if the
       statement is filed three months or more after a fiscal year end.
   ■   Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F: Companies are required to file these forms
       annually. Form 10-K is for US registrants, Form 40-F is for certain Canadian
       registrants, and Form 20-F is for all other non-US registrants. These forms
       require a comprehensive overview, including information concerning a
       company’s business, risk factors, financial disclosures, legal proceedings,
       and information related to management. The financial disclosures include
       audited financial statements and notes, management discussion and analysis
       (MD&A) of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and
       auditors’ reports.
   ■   Annual Report: In addition to the SEC’s annual filings (e.g., Form 10-K),
       most companies prepare an annual report to shareholders. This is not a
       requirement of the SEC. The annual report is usually viewed as one of the
       most significant opportunities for a company to present itself to share-
       holders and other external parties; accordingly, it is often a highly polished
       marketing document with photographs, an opening letter from the chief
       executive officer, financial data, market segment information, research and
       development activities, and future corporate goals. In contrast, the Form
       10-K is a more legal type of document with minimal marketing emphasis.
       Although the perspectives vary, a company’s annual report and its Form
       10-K have considerable overlap. Some companies prepare only Form 10-K
       or publish an annual report that consists of a few pages of material and a
       copy of the 10-K.
   ■   Proxy Statement/Form DEF-14A: The SEC requires that shareholders of a
       company receive a proxy statement before a shareholder meeting. A proxy is
       an authorization from the shareholder giving another party the right to cast
       its vote. Shareholder meetings are held at least once a year, but any special
       meetings also require a proxy statement. Proxies, especially annual meeting

                                 proxies, contain information that is often useful to financial analysts.
                                 Such information typically includes proposals that require a shareholder
                                 vote, details of security ownership by management and principal owners,
                                 biographical information on directors, and disclosure of executive compen-
                                 sation. Proxy statement information is filed with the SEC as Form DEF-14A.
                            ■    Forms 10-Q and 6-K: Companies are required to submit these forms for
                                 interim periods (quarterly for US companies on Form 10-Q, and semiannu-
                                 ally for many non-US companies on Form 6-K). The filing requires certain
                                 financial information, including unaudited financial statements and an
                                 MD&A for the interim period covered by the report. Additionally, if cer-
                                 tain types of non-recurring events—such as the adoption of a significant
                                 accounting policy, commencement of significant litigation, or a material
                                 limitation on the rights of any holders of any class of registered securities—
                                 take place during the period covered by the report, these events must be
                                 included in the Form 10-Q report. Companies may provide the 10-Q report
                                 to shareholders or may prepare a separate, abbreviated, quarterly report to
                                 shareholders.


                         KNOWLEDGE CHECK


                           1. In September 2017, Sea Ltd, the Singapore-based technology
                              company, filed a registration statement with the US SEC to register its initial
                              public offering of securities (American Depositary Shares, each representing
                              one Class A Ordinary Share) on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition
                              to a large amount of financial information, the registration statement pro-
                              vided over 50 pages of discussion on Sea Ltd.’s business and industry.

                                Which of the following is most likely to have been included in Sea’s registra-
                                tion statement?
                                A. Underwriters’ fairness opinion of the offering
                                B. Assessment of risk factors involved in the business
                                 C. Projected cash flows and earnings for the business
                                Solution:
                                B is correct. Information provided by companies in registration statements
                                typically includes disclosures about the securities being offered for sale; the
                                relationship of these new securities to the issuer’s other capital securities;
                                the information typically provided in the annual filings; recent audited
                                financial statements; and risk factors involved in the business. Companies
                                provide information useful in developing projected cash flows and earnings
                                but do not typically include these in the registration statement, nor do they
                                provide opinions of the underwriters.

                             A company or its officers make other SEC filings—either periodically, or, if sig-
                         nificant events or transactions have occurred, in between the periodic reports noted
                         previously. By their nature, these forms sometimes contain timely information that
                         may have significant valuation implications.
                            ■    Form 8-K: In addition to filing annual and interim reports, SEC registrants
                                 must report material corporate events on a more current basis. Form 8-K
                                 (6-K for non-US registrants) is the “current report” companies must file
                                 with the SEC to announce such major events as acquisitions or disposals of

         corporate assets, changes in securities and trading markets, matters related
         to accountants and financial statements, corporate governance and manage-
         ment changes, and Regulation FD disclosures.6
     ■   Forms 3, 4, 5, and 144: Forms 3, 4, and 5 are required to report beneficial
         ownership of securities. These filings are required for any director or officer
         of a registered company as well as beneficial owners of greater than 10 per-
         cent of a class of registered equity securities. Form 3 is the initial statement,
         Form 4 reports changes, and Form 5 is the annual report. Form 144 is notice
         of the proposed sale of restricted securities or securities held by an affili-
         ate of the issuer. These forms can be used to examine purchases and sales
         of securities by officers, directors, and other affiliates of the company, who
         collectively are regarded as corporate insiders.
     ■   Form 11-K: This is the annual report of employee stock purchase, savings,
         and similar plans. It might be of interest to analysts for companies with sig-
         nificant employee benefit plans because it contains more information about
         these plans than disclosed in the company’s financial statements.
     In jurisdictions other than the United States, similar legislation exists for the pur-
pose of regulating securities and capital markets. Regulatory authorities are responsible
for enforcing regulation, and securities regulation is intended to be consistent with
the IOSCO objectives described in the previous section. Within each jurisdiction,
regulators will either establish or, more typically, recognize and adopt a specified
set or sets of accounting standards. The regulators will also establish reporting and
filing requirements. IOSCO members have agreed to cooperate in the development,
implementation, and enforcement of internationally recognized and consistent stan-
dards of regulation.


Capital Markets Regulation in Europe
Each individual member state of the European Union (EU) regulates capital markets
in its jurisdiction. Certain regulations, however, have been adopted at the EU level.
Importantly, the EU agreed that from 2005 consolidated accounts of EU-listed compa-
nies would use International Financial Reporting Standards. The endorsement process
by which newly issued IFRS are adopted by the EU reflects the balance between the
individual member state’s autonomy and the need for cooperation and convergence.
When the IASB issues a new standard, the European Financial Reporting Advisory
Group advises the European Commission on the standard, and the Standards Advice
Review Group provides the Commission with an opinion about that advice. Based
on the input from these two entities, the Commission prepares a draft endorsement
regulation. The Accounting Regulatory Committee votes on the proposal; and if the
vote is favorable, the proposal proceeds to the European Parliament and the Council
of the European Union for approval.7
    Two bodies related to securities regulation established by the European Commission
are the European Securities Committee (ESC) and the European Securities and Market
Authority (ESMA). The ESC consists of high-level representatives of member states
and advises the European Commission on securities policy issues. ESMA is an EU
cross-border supervisor established to coordinate supervision of the EU market. As
noted earlier, regulation still rests with the individual member states and, therefore,


6 Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) provides that when an issuer discloses material non-public information
to certain individuals or entities—generally, securities market professionals such as stock analysts or hold-
ers of the issuer’s securities who may trade on the basis of the information—the issuer must make public
disclosure of that information. In this way, the rule aims to promote full and fair disclosure.

18   Learning Module 1                                                  Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis


                         requirements for registering shares and filing periodic financial reports vary from
                         country to country. ESMA is one of three European supervisory authorities; the two
                         others supervise the banking and insurance industries.


                         Financial Notes and Supplementary Schedules
                         The notes (also sometimes referred to as footnotes) that accompany the financial
                         statements are required and often account for a large percentage of the financial dis-
                         closures made in regulatory filings. The notes provide information that is essential to
                         understanding the information provided in the statements. Sea Ltd.’s 2021 financial
                         statements, for example, include more than 60 pages of notes.
                              The notes disclose the basis of preparation for the financial statements. For exam-
                         ple, Sea Ltd. discloses that its fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year; its financial
                         statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP; the statements are thousands
                         of US dollars unless otherwise specified; and the figures have been rounded, which
                         might give rise to minor discrepancies when they are added. Sea Ltd. also states that
                         its financial statements are on a consolidated basis—that is, aggregating the financial
                         records of all its subsidiaries it controls, after eliminating intercompany balances and
                         transactions.
                              The notes also disclose information about the accounting policies, methods, and
                         estimates used to prepare the financial statements. Both IFRS and US GAAP allow some
                         flexibility in choosing among alternative policies and methods when accounting for
                         certain items. This flexibility aims to meet the divergent needs of many businesses for
                         reporting a variety of economic transactions. In addition to differences in accounting
                         policies and methods, differences arise as a result of estimates needed to record and
                         measure transactions, events, and financial statement line items.
                              Overall, flexibility in accounting choices is necessary because, ideally, a company
                         will select those policies, methods, and estimates that are allowable and most relevant
                         and that fairly reflect the unique economic environment of the company’s business
                         and industry. Flexibility can, however, create challenges for the analyst because the use
                         of different policies, methods, and estimates reduces comparability across different
                         companies’ financial statements.
                              For example, if a company acquires a piece of equipment to use in its operations,
                         accounting standards require that the cost of the equipment be reported as an expense
                         (depreciation) by allocating its cost, less any residual value, in a systematic manner
                         over the equipment’s useful life. Accounting standards permit flexibility, however, in
                         determining the way each year’s expense is determined. Two companies may acquire
                         similar equipment but use different methods and assumptions to record the expense
                         over time. An analyst’s ability to compare the companies’ performance is hindered
                         by the difference. Analysts must understand reporting choices to make appropriate
                         adjustments when comparing companies’ financial positions and performance.
                              For many companies, the financial notes and supplemental schedules provide
                         explanatory information about every line item (or almost every line item) on the bal-
                         ance sheet and income statement. In addition, note disclosures include information
                         about the following (this is not an exhaustive list):
                             ■   segment reporting;
                             ■   business acquisitions and disposals;
                             ■   contractual obligations, including both on- and off-balance sheet debt;
                             ■   financial instruments and risks arising from financial instruments;
                             ■   legal proceedings;
                             ■   related-party transactions; and
                             ■   subsequent events (i.e., events that occur after the balance sheet date).

   Experience using the disclosures made by a company and its competitors typically
enhances an analyst’s judgment about the relative importance of different disclosures
and the ways in which they can be helpful.


Business and Geographic Segment Reporting
Many companies are composed of several businesses. Although companies are not
required to provide disaggregated full financial statements for all of its businesses or
subsidiaries, they are required to provide some disaggregated information under both
IFRS and US GAAP in the notes to financial statements by operating segment. An
operating segment is defined as a component of a company that
   ■   engages in activities that may generate revenue and create expenses, includ-
       ing a start-up segment that has yet to earn revenues;
   ■   whose results are regularly reviewed by the company’s senior management;
       and
   ■   for which discrete financial information is available.
     A company must disclose separate information about any operating segment that
meets certain quantitative criteria—namely, the segment constitutes 10 percent or
more of the combined operating segments’ revenue, assets, or profit. (For purposes
of determining whether a segment constitutes 10 percent or more of combined prof-
its or losses, the criteria is expressed in terms of the absolute value of the segment’s
profit or loss as a percentage of the greater of (1) the combined profits of all profit-
able segments and (2) the absolute amount of the combined losses of all loss-making
segments.) If, after applying these quantitative criteria, the combined revenue from
external customers for all reportable segments combined is less than 75 percent of
the total company revenue, the company must identify additional reportable segments
until the 75 percent level is reached. Small segments might be combined as one if they
share a substantial number of factors that define a business or geographical segment,
or they might be combined with a similar significant reportable segment. Information
about operating segments and businesses that are not reportable is combined in an
“all other segments” category.
     Companies must disclose the factors used to identify reportable segments and the
types of products and services sold by each reportable segment.
     For each reportable segment, the following should also be disclosed in the notes
to financial statements:
   ■   revenue, distinguishing between revenue to external customers and revenue
       from other segments;
   ■   a measure of profit or loss;
   ■   a measure of assets and liabilities (if these amounts are regularly reviewed
       by the company’s chief decision-making officer);
   ■   interest revenue and interest expense;
   ■   cost of property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets acquired;
   ■   depreciation and amortization expense;
   ■   other non-cash expenses;
   ■   income tax expense or income; and
   ■   share of the net profit or loss of an investment accounted for under the
       equity method.
    Companies also must provide a reconciliation between the information of report-
able segments and the consolidated financial statements in terms of segment revenue,
profit or loss, assets, and liabilities.

                                      A company’s reporting segments can be useful as a means of quickly understanding
                                  what a company does and how and where it earns money. The segment data shown
                                  in Exhibit 4 appear in the notes to the financial statements for Sea Ltd.

                                     The Company has three reportable segments, namely digital entertainment,
                                     e-commerce and digital financial services. The Chief Operating Decision Maker
                                     (CODM) reviews the performance of each segment based on revenue and certain
                                     key operating metrics of the operations and uses these results for the purposes
                                     of allocating resources to and evaluating financial performance of each segment.
                                     Description of Reportable Segments:

    From the data in Exhibit 4, an analyst can quickly see that the e-commerce seg-
ment accounted for just over 50 percent of total revenues in 2021 but generated a
large operating loss, while the digital entertainment segment accounted for most of
the remaining revenues and was the only profitable segment. An analyst would likely
spend a majority of their time on examining the past and present, and forecasting
the future results of these two segments. Similarly, an analyst would use these disclo-
sures to understand that Southeast Asia and Latin America are the company’s most
important geographies.
    Identifying segments requires significant judgment by management, and companies
often change the definition of segments and related disclosures.
    Another required disclosure is the company’s reliance on any single customer. If
any single customer represents 10 percent or more of the company’s total revenues,
the company must disclose that fact, though not the identity of that customer. From
an analysts’ perspective, information about a concentrated customer base can be
useful in assessing the risks faced by the company.


Management Commentary or Management’s Discussion and
Analysis
Regulatory filings such as Form 10-K and 10-Q include a section in which manage-
ment discusses a variety of issues, including the nature of the business, past results,
and outlook. This section is referred to by a variety of names, including management
report(ing), management commentary, operating and financial review, and MD&A.
   The discussion by management is arguably one of the most useful parts of a
company’s annual report besides the financial statements themselves; however, other
than excerpts from the financial statements, information included in the management
commentary is typically unaudited. In Germany, management reporting has been
required since 1931 and is audited.
   To help improve the quality of the discussion by management, the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued an IFRS Practice Statement “Management
Commentary” includes a framework for the preparation and presentation of man-
agement commentary. The framework provides guidance rather than sets forth
22   Learning Module 1                                                      Introduction to Financial Statement Analysis


                         requirements in a standard. The framework identifies five content elements of a
                         “decision-useful management commentary”: (1) the nature of the business; (2) man-
                         agement’s objectives and strategies; (3) the company’s significant resources, risks,
                         and relationships; (4) results of operations; and (5) critical performance measures.
                             In the United States, the SEC requires listed companies to provide an MD&A
                         and specifies the content.8 Management must highlight any favorable or unfavorable
                         trends and identify significant events and uncertainties that affect the company’s
                         liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations. The MD&A must also provide
                         information about the effects of inflation, changing prices, or other material events
                         and uncertainties that may cause the future operating results and financial condition
                         to materially depart from the current reported financial information. In addition, the
                         MD&A must provide information about off-balance-sheet obligations and about con-
                         tractual commitments, such as purchase obligations. Management should also discuss
                         the critical accounting policies that require them to make subjective judgments and
                         that have a significant impact on reported financial results.
                             The management commentary, or MD&A, is a good starting place for under-
                         standing information in the financial statements. In particular, the forward-looking
                         disclosures, such as those about planned capital expenditures, new store openings, or
                         divestitures, can be useful in projecting a company’s future performance. However, the
                         commentary is only one input for the analyst seeking an objective and independent

                             Sea Ltd.’s 2021 annual report on Form 20-F includes much information of potential

                         the Company” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” that discuss the
                         company’s history, business model, strategies, key performance indicators, risk factors,
                         relevant laws and regulations, recent financial performance and position, cash flows

                         Auditor's Reports
                         Financial statements presented in companies’ annual reports are generally required to
                         be audited by an independent accounting firm in accordance with specified auditing
                         standards. The independent auditor then provides a written opinion on the financial
                         statements. This opinion is referred to as the audit report. Audit reports may vary in
                         different jurisdictions, but the minimum components, including a specific statement
                         of the auditor’s opinion, are similar. Audits of financial statements may be required
                         by contractual arrangement, law, or regulation.
                             International standards on auditing (ISAs) have been developed by the International
                         Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This body has emerged from the
                         International Federation of Accountants. ISAs have been adopted by many countries
                         and are referenced in audit reports issued in those countries. Other countries, such
                         as the United States, specify their own auditing standards. With the enactment of
                         the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 in the United States, auditing standards for public
                         companies are promulgated by the PCAOB.




                         8 Relevant sections of SEC requirements are included for reference in the FASB Accounting Standards
                         Codification (ASC). The FASB ASC does not include sections of SEC requirements that deal with matters
                         outside the basic financial statements, such as the MD&A.
Regulated Sources of Information                                                                              23


    Under ISAs, the overall objectives of an auditor in conducting an audit of financial
statements are
    ■    to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
         whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,
         thereby enabling the auditor to express an opinion on whether the finan-
         cial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an
         applicable financial reporting framework; and
    ■    to report on the financial statements, and communicate as required by the
         ISAs, in accordance with the auditor’s findings.9
     Publicly traded companies may also have requirements set by regulators or stock
exchanges, such as appointing an independent audit committee within its board of
directors to oversee the audit process. The audit process provides a basis for the
independent auditor to express an opinion on whether the information in the audited
financial statements presents fairly the financial position, performance, and cash flows
of the company in accordance with a specified set of accounting standards.
     Audits are designed and conducted using sampling techniques, and financial
statement line items may be based on estimates and assumptions. This means that the
auditors cannot express an opinion that provides absolute assurance about the accuracy
or precision of the financial statements. Instead, the independent audit report provides
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are fairly presented, meaning that
there is a high probability that the audited financial statements are free from material
error, fraud, or illegal acts that have a direct effect on the financial statements.
     The independent audit report expresses the auditor’s opinion on the fairness of the
audited financial statements, and specifies which financial statements were audited, the
reporting entity, and the date. An unqualified audit opinion states that the financial
statements give a “true and fair view” (international) or are “fairly presented” (inter-
national and United States) in accordance with applicable accounting standards. This
is also referred to as an “unmodified” or a “clean” opinion and is the one that analysts
would like to see in a financial report. There are several other types of modified
opinions. A qualified audit opinion is one in which there is some scope limitation or
exception to accounting standards. Exceptions are described in the audit report with
additional explanatory paragraphs so that the analyst can determine the importance
of the exception. An adverse audit opinion is issued when an auditor determines that
the financial statements materially depart from accounting standards and are not
fairly presented. Finally, a disclaimer of opinion occurs when, for some reason, such
as a scope limitation, the auditors are unable to issue an opinion.
     The audit report also describes the basis for the auditor’s opinion and, for listed
companies, includes a discussion of Key Audit Matters (international) and Critical
Audit Matters (United States).10 Key Audit Matters are defined as issues that the
auditor considers to be most important, such as those that have a higher risk of
misstatement, involve significant management judgment, or report the effects of sig-
nificant transactions during the period. Critical Audit Matters are defined as issues
that involve “especially challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment” and
similarly include areas with higher risk of misstatement or that involve significant
management judgment and estimates. However, Key and Critical Audit Matters are
not necessarily the most important factors for analysts and investors.

Auditing (ISA) ISA 701, effective in 2017, issued by the International Audit and Assurance Standards Board.
Discussion of Critical Audit Matters in the auditor’s report is required by the Auditor Reporting Standard
AS 3101, effective for large filers’ fiscal years ending on or after 30 June 2019, issued by the PCAOB.

                           Opinion on the Financial Statements
                           We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sea Limited
                           (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated
                           statements of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and shareholders’
                           equity (deficit) for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
                           2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
                           statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
                           in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
                           31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
                           of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with
                           U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
                               We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
                           Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal
                           control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria
                           established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
                           of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework),
                           and our report dated April 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

                           Basis for Opinion
                           These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s manage-
                           ment. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial
                           statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
                           the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
                           in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
                           regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We
                           conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
                           standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur-
                           ance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
                           whether due to error or fraud.
                               Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
                           misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
                           performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
                           examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
                           the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
                           principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as eval-
                           uating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
                           audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  Recognition of Digital Entertainment (“DE”) Revenue
  Description of the Matter:
      For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s revenue arising from
  DE was $4,320.0 million.
      As outlined in Note 2(o) of the consolidated financial statements, DE rev-
  enue is recognized over the performance obligation period. The Company has
  determined that an implied obligation exists to the paying users to continue
  providing hosting services and access to the purchased virtual goods within the
  online games over an estimated service period. Such service period is largely
  determined in accordance with the estimated average lifespan of the paying
  users of the said games or similar games.
      Auditing the DE revenue recognition process was complex and involved
  judgement to determine the historical paying users’ inactive rate and playing
  behavior, in estimating the average lifespan of the paying users of the said games
  or similar games. In addition, the Company utilized various operating systems
  to process user data and transactions and relied on automated processes and
  controls over the completeness and accuracy of the historical user and game
  data, which were key inputs to the above-mentioned estimates.
      How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:
      We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
  effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s DE revenue recognition
  process. For example, we tested the automated controls of the related operating
  systems. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s review controls over
  assessing the completeness and accuracy of the historical user and game data
  and the appropriateness of the judgements regarding the most relevant historical
  user and game data to be applied in their estimates.
      To test the recognition of DE revenue, our audit procedures included,
  among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the above-mentioned
  underlying historical user and game data and assessing the reasonableness of
  the historical data applied in estimating the average lifespan of the paying users
  of the said games or similar games. We also recalculated the amount of revenue
  to be deferred based on management’s estimated service periods and compared
  those amounts with the amounts recorded by the Company.

  Measurement of long-lived assets in E-commerce (“EC”)
  segment
  Description of the Matter:
      As at December 31, 2021, the Company’s long-lived assets in EC segment
  amounted to approximately 75.7% of the Company’s long-lived assets. The
  long-lived assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use
  assets and intangible assets.
      As outlined in Note 2(m) to the consolidated financial statements, the
  Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when there are events
  or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amounts of the
  long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Due to the continued losses incurred
  by EC segment, the Company evaluated the related long-lived assets for impair-
  ment at the asset group level by comparing the carrying amount of the asset
  group to the recoverable value determined by forecasted undiscounted cash
  flows expected to be generated by this asset group.

                                Auditing management’s long-lived assets impairment test was highly judg-
                            mental due to the magnitude of the carrying amount of long-lived assets and
                            management’s judgement in estimating the recoverable value (undiscounted
                            cash flows) of the asset group, which were sensitive to key assumptions such as
                            projected revenue and sales and marketing expenses.
                                How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit:
                                We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating
                            effectiveness of controls over the Company’s long-lived asset impairment process
                            to determine the recoverable value of the asset group. For example, we tested
                            controls over management’s review of the key assumptions used in estimating
                            the recoverable value.
                                To test the impairment of long-lived assets, our audit procedures included,
                            among others, obtaining an understanding from management regarding the
                            basis of which the undiscounted cash flows were prepared and assessing the
                            reasonableness of the forecasted undiscounted cash flows by comparing them
                            against the Company’s business strategies and underlying key assumptions over
                            the forecast periods, taking into consideration current industry and economic
                            trends. We performed sensitivity analyses over the key assumptions described
                            above to evaluate the changes to the estimated recoverable value for the asset
                            group that would result from changes in the assumptions.

                             In the United States, under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, the auditors must also express
                         an opinion on the company’s internal control systems. This information may be pro-
                         vided in a separate opinion or incorporated as a paragraph in the opinion related to
                         the financial statements. Internal controls are the company’s processes, personnel,
                         and systems designed to ensure that the company’s process for generating financial
                         reports is sound. Although management has always been responsible for maintaining
                         effective internal control, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act greatly increases management’s
                         responsibility for demonstrating that the company’s internal controls are effective.
                         Management of publicly traded companies in the United States are now required by
                         securities regulators to explicitly accept responsibility for the effectiveness of internal
                         control, evaluate the effectiveness of internal control using suitable control criteria,
                         support the evaluation with sufficient competent evidence, and provide a report on
                         internal control.
                             Although these reports and attestations provide some assurances to analysts, they
                         are not infallible. The analyst must always use a degree of healthy skepticism when
                         analyzing financial statements.

COMPARISON OF IFRS WITH ALTERNATIVE
FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEMS                                                                        5
                describe implications for financial analysis of alternative financial
                reporting systems and the importance of monitoring developments
                in financial reporting standards

The adoption of IFRS as the required financial reporting standard by most countries
outside the United States has advanced the goal of global convergence. Nevertheless,
there are still significant differences in financial reporting in the global capital mar-
kets. Arguably, the most critical are the differences that exist between IFRS and US
GAAP as a significant number of the world’s listed companies use one of these two
reporting standards.
    In general, the IASB and FASB work together to coordinate changes to account-
ing standards and reduce differences between the standards. While convergence of
conceptual frameworks and existing standards was put on hold in the late 2000s, new
accounting standards have been mostly or entirely converged, resulting in increasing
uniformity over time as major new standards have been adopted (e.g., revenue rec-
ognition, leasing, credit losses). Maintaining convergence on new standards remains
a priority of both standard-setting bodies. Later modules provide a more detailed
review of related differences in IFRS and US GAAP, though some major differences
are outlined in Exhibit 6.

Because reconciliation disclosures between IFRS and US GAAP are not required,
an analyst comparing two companies that use different reporting standards must be
aware of areas in which accounting standards have not converged. In many cases,
a user of financial statements prepared under different accounting standards does
not have enough information to make the specific adjustments required to achieve
comparability. Instead, an analyst must maintain caution in interpreting comparative

                         financial measures produced under different accounting standards and monitor sig-
                         nificant developments in financial reporting standards, as this can have important
                         implications for comparing the performance of companies and security valuation.


                         Monitoring Developments in Financial Reporting Standards
                         Analysts need to monitor ongoing developments in financial reporting and assess their
                         implications for security analysis and valuation. The need to monitor developments
                         in financial reporting standards does not mean that analysts should be accountants.
                         An accountant monitors these developments from a preparer’s perspective; an analyst
                         needs to monitor them from a user’s perspective. More specifically, analysts need to
                         know how these developments will affect financial reports.
                             Analysts can remain aware of developments in financial reporting standards by
                         monitoring new products or transactions, actions of standard setters and other groups
                         representing users of financial statements (such as CFA Institute), and company dis-
                         closures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates.


                         New Products or Types of Transactions
                         New products and new types of transactions can have unusual or unique elements to
                         them such that no explicit guidance in the financial reporting standards exists. New
                         products or transactions typically arise from economic events, such as new businesses
                         (e.g., fintech), or from a newly developed financial instrument or financial structure (e.g.
                         cryptocurrencies and other digital assets). Financial instruments, whether exchange
                         traded or not, are typically designed to enhance a company’s business or to mitigate
                         inherent risks. At times, however, financial instruments or structured transactions
                         have been developed primarily for purposes of financial report “window dressing.”
                             Although companies might discuss new products and transactions in their finan-
                         cial reports, the analyst can also monitor business journals and the capital markets to
                         identify such items. Additionally, when one company in an industry develops a new
                         product or transaction, other companies in the industry often do the same. Once
                         new products, financial instruments, or structured transactions are identified, it is
                         helpful to gain an understanding of the business purpose. If necessary, an analyst can
                         obtain further information from a company’s management, which should be able to
                         describe the economic purpose, the financial statement reporting, significant estimates,
                         judgments applied in determining the reporting, and future cash flow implications
                         for these items.


                         Evolving Standards and the Role of CFA Institute
                         The actions of standard setters and regulators are unlikely to be helpful in identifying
                         new products and transactions, given the lag between new product development and
                         regulatory action. Monitoring the actions of these authorities is nonetheless important
                         for another reason: Changes in regulations can affect companies’ financial reports and,
                         thus, valuations. This is particularly true if the financial reporting standards change
                         to require more explicit identification of matters affecting asset/liability valuation or
                         financial performance. For example, one regulatory change required companies to
                         include a provision for expenses associated with the grant and vesting of employee stock
                         option grants as an expense in the income statement. Prior to the required expensing,
                         an analyst could assess the dilutive effect to shareholders associated with stock option
                         grants only by reviewing information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
                             To the extent that some market participants do not examine financial statement
                         details and thus ignore some items when valuing a company’s securities, more explicit
                         identification could affect the value of the company’s securities. Additionally, it is

plausible to believe that management is more attentive to and rigorous in any cal-
culations/estimates of items that appear in the financial statements, compared with
items that are disclosed only in the notes.
    The IASB (www​.iasb​.org) and FASB (www​.fasb​.org) provide a great deal of infor-
mation on their websites regarding new standards and proposals for future changes
in standards. In addition, the IASB and FASB seek input from the financial analyst
community—those who regularly use financial statements in making investment and
credit decisions. When a new standard is proposed, an exposure draft is made available
and users of financial statements can draft comment letters and position papers for
submission to the IASB and FASB to evaluate the proposal.
    CFA Institute is active in supporting improvements to financial reporting. Volunteer
members of CFA Institute serve on several liaison committees that meet regularly to
make recommendations to the IASB and FASB on proposed standards and to draft
comment letters and position papers. The comment letters and position papers of these
groups on financial reporting issues are available at www​.cfainstitute​.org/​advocacy.
    In 2007, CFA Institute issued a position paper titled A Comprehensive Business
Reporting Model: Financial Reporting for Investors, which provides a suggested model
for significantly improving financial reporting. The position paper remains relevant
in stating:
        Corporate financial statements and their related disclosures are fundamental
        to sound investment decision making. The well-being of the world’s finan-
        cial markets, and of the millions of investors who entrust their financial
        present and future to those markets, depends directly on the information
        financial statements and disclosures provide. Consequently, the quality
        of the information drives global financial markets. The quality, in turn,
        depends directly on the principles and standards managers apply when
        recognizing and measuring the economic activities and events affecting
        their companies’ operations. …
            Investors require timeliness, transparency, comparability, and con-
        sistency in financial reporting. Investors have a preference for decision
        relevance over reliability … “analysts need to know economic reality—what
        is really going on—to the greatest extent it can be depicted by accounting
        numbers.” Corporate financial statements that fail to reflect this economic
        reality undermine the investment decision-making process.11
    Among other principles, the proposed model stresses the importance of informa-
tion regarding the current fair value of assets and liabilities, of neutrality in financial
reporting, and of providing detailed information on cash flows to investors through
the choice of the so-called direct format for the cash flow statement.
    In summary, analysts can improve their investment decision making by keeping cur-
rent on financial reporting standards. In addition, analysts can contribute to improving
financial reporting by sharing their perspective as users with standard-setting bodies,
which typically invite comments concerning proposed changes.

             6           OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION

                                       describe information sources that analysts use in financial statement
                                       analysis besides annual and interim financial reports

                         In addition to regulated information from issuers such as the financial statements
                         and notes in filings, analysts use a variety of other information sources for financial
                         analysis, which we group by origin: issuers, public third-party, proprietary third-party,
                         and proprietary primary research.
                            ■   Issuer sources (other than regulatory filings such as annual and quarterly
                                reports and proxy statements)

                                ●   Earnings calls. Earnings calls are webcast or teleconferenced presenta-
                                    tions and question-and-answer sessions hosted by issuers’ management
                                    to discuss financial results. The primary audience for the calls are ana-
                                    lysts, investors, and members of the media. While not legally required,
                                    most public companies conduct these calls to provide complementary
                                    information to their regulatory filings, such as explaining differences in
                                    performances from expectations, revisions to forward-looking targets,
                                    and explaining corporate actions such as acquisitions and restructur-
                                    ings. Analysts ask probing questions to gain further color from manage-
                                    ment to understand past results and actions to sharpen their estimates.
                                    Platforms such as Bloomberg, Wind, and FactSet transcribe earnings
                                    calls and other presentations.
                                ●   Presentations and events, such as investor days. Similar to earnings
                                    calls but scheduled on an ad hoc basis, issuers and investment banks
                                    sometimes host events during which management teams give in-depth
                                    presentations on their business or specific topics and business segments.
                                    Like earnings calls, analysts must be aware that management is biased
                                    to their perspective, and often need to ask questions for the information
                                    they want.
                                ●   Press releases. Press releases are announcements and statements of
                                    information (typically in writing but can be videos or graphics) by com-
                                    panies and their management. Common topics include notifications of
                                    upcoming events, product releases and changes, management and board
                                    of director changes, and M&A or restructuring announcements. Press
                                    releases are often distributed not only on issuers’ websites but also on
                                    third-party news sources.
                                ●   Speaking with management, investor relations, or other company
                                    personnel.
                                ●   Company website or properties that the analyst may be able to visit as a
                                    customer or an investor. It is often useful to experience an issuer’s and
                                    competitors’ products firsthand, though it is not always possible (e.g.,
                                    pharmaceuticals).
                            ■   Public third-party sources

                                ●   Free industry whitepapers or analyst reports from a consultancy, usually
                                    accessed through internet search engines.
Other Sources of Information                                                                 31


        ●   Economic or industry indicators from governments and other organi-
            zations, such as retail sales and price indexes, often released monthly or
            quarterly.
        ●   General news outlets.
        ●   Industry-specific news outlets.
        ●   Social media, which may be a useful gauge of customer sentiment for a
            company’s products.
    ■   Proprietary third-party sources

        ●   Analyst reports and communications, including from the sell side or
            analysts and credit rating agencies.
        ●   Reports and data from platforms such as Bloomberg, Wind, and FactSet.
        ●   Reports and data from consultancies, often industry-specific sources,
            such as Rystad in energy, iQvia and Evaluate in biopharma, and Gartner
            and IDC in information technology industries.
    ■   Proprietary primary research

        ●   Surveys, conversations, product comparisons, and other studies commis-
            sioned by the analyst or conducted directly.
    Information on the economy, industry, and peer companies is useful in putting
the company’s financial performance and position in perspective and in assess-
ing the company’s future. In most cases, information from sources apart from the
company is crucial to an analyst’s effectiveness. For example, an analyst studying a
consumer-oriented company will typically seek direct experience with the products
(taste the food or drink, use the shampoo or soap, visit the stores or hotels). An analyst
following a highly regulated industry will study the existing and expected relevant
regulations. An analyst following a highly technical industry will gain relevant expertise
personally or seek input from a technical specialist.

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. Ratios are an output of the process information step but are an input
   into the analyze/interpret data step.

2. A is correct. The follow-up phase involves gathering information and repeat-
   ing the analysis to determine whether it is necessary to update reports and
   recommendations.

3. C is correct. In general, analysts seek to examine the past and current perfor-
   mance and financial position of a company to form expectations about its future
   performance and financial position.

4. B is correct. The primary role of financial statement analysis is to use financial
   reports prepared by companies to evaluate their past, current, and potential
   performance and financial position for the purpose of making investment, credit,
   and other economic decisions.

5. B is correct. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is currently
   charged with developing International Financial Reporting Standards.

6. B is correct. US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are developed by the
   US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

7. C is correct. A core objective of IOSCO is to ensure that markets are fair, effi-
   cient, and transparent. The other core objectives are to reduce, not eliminate,
   systemic risk and to protect investors, not all users of financial statements.

8. C is correct. The notes provide information that is essential to understanding the
   information provided in the primary statements.

9. C is correct. The notes disclose choices in accounting policies, methods, and
   estimates.

10. B is correct. Disclosure of management compensation is typically included in
    the proxy statement. An earnings release is about corporate earnings, not what
    managers earn as compensation.

11. B is correct. These are components of management commentary.

12. C is correct. An unqualified opinion is a “clean” opinion and indicates that the
    financial statements present the company’s performance and financial position
    fairly in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

13. B is correct. A qualified audit opinion is one in which there is some scope limita-
    tion or exception to accounting standards. Exceptions are described in the audit
    report with additional explanatory paragraphs so that the analyst can determine
    the importance of the exception.

14. B is correct. The independent audit report provides reasonable assurance that the
    financial statements are fairly presented, meaning that there is a high probability
    that the audited financial statements are free from material error, fraud, or illegal
    acts that have a direct effect on the financial statements.

15. B is correct. Interim reports are typically provided semiannually or quarterly and
    require certain financial information, including unaudited financial statements

                            and an MD&A for the interim period covered by the report. Unqualified refers to
                            a type of audit opinion.

                         16. B is correct. When performing financial statement analysis, analysts should
                             review all company sources of information as well as information from external
                             sources regarding the economy, the industry, the company, and peer (compara-
                             ble) companies.

             1           INTRODUCTION
                         Income statements and analytical measures derived from them, such as sales growth,
                         operating margin, and earnings per share (EPS), are critical for equity and credit anal-
                         ysis. Investors analyze income statements to evaluate companies’ growth, profitability,
                         and risks, and often use income statement figures in valuation. Corporate financial
                         announcements frequently emphasize information reported in income statements,
                         particularly earnings, more than information reported in the other financial statements.

                            LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                               ■   Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned, which may or
                                   may not be in the same period as the related cash collection.
                               ■   An analyst should identify differences in companies’ revenue recogni-
                                   tion methods and adjust reported revenue where possible to facilitate
                                   comparability. In cases in which the available information does not
                                   permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the revenue recogni-
                                   tion as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how
                                   differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments
                                   about profitability.
                               ■   As of the beginning of 2018, revenue recognition standards have
                                   converged across US GAAP and International Financial Reporting
                                   Standards (IFRS). The core principle of the converged standards is
                                   that revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised
                                   goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consid-
                                   eration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for
                                   those goods or services.”
                               ■   To achieve the core principle, the standard describes the application of
                                   five steps in recognizing revenue. The standard also specifies the treat-
                                   ment of some related contract costs and disclosure requirements.
                               ■   The general principles of expense recognition include a process to
                                   match expenses to revenue (e.g., cost of goods sold), to the period in
                                   which the expenditure occurs (e.g., administrative costs), or to the
                                   period of expected benefits of the expenditures (e.g., depreciation and
                                   amortization).
                               ■   In expense recognition, choice of method (i.e., depreciation method
                                   and inventory cost method), as well as estimates (i.e., uncollectible
                                   accounts, warranty expenses, assets’ useful life, and salvage value)
                                   affect a company’s reported income. An analyst should identify differ-
                                   ences in companies’ expense recognition methods and adjust reported
                                   financial statements where possible to facilitate comparability. In
                                   cases in which the available information does not permit adjustment,
                                   an analyst can characterize the policies and estimates as more or less
                                   conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in poli-
                                   cies might affect financial ratios and judgments about companies’
                                   performance.
                               ■   To assess a company’s future earnings, it is helpful to separate those
                                   prior years’ items of income and expense that are likely to continue in
                                   the future from those items that are less likely to continue.

       ■   Under IFRS, a company should present additional line items, headings,
           and subtotals beyond those specified when such presentation is rele-
           vant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. Some
           items from prior years clearly are not expected to continue in future
           periods and are separately disclosed on a company’s income statement.
           Under US GAAP, unusual or infrequently occurring items, which are
           material, are presented separately within income from continuing
           operations.
       ■   Non-operating items are reported separately from operating items on
           the income statement. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the income
           statement reports separately the effect of the disposal of a component
           operation as a “discontinued” operation, net of income taxes.
       ■   Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders
           divided by the weighted average number of common shares out-
           standing over a period. The amount of income available to common
           shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred
           dividends (if any) have been paid.
       ■   If a company has a simple capital structure (i.e., one with no poten-
           tially dilutive securities), then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS.
           If, however, a company has dilutive securities, its diluted EPS is no
           greater than its basic EPS.
       ■   Diluted EPS is calculated using the if-converted method for convert-
           ible securities and the treasury stock method for options.
       ■   Common-size analysis of the income statement involves stating each
           line item on the income statement as a percentage of sales. Common-
           size statements facilitate comparison across time periods and across
           companies of different sizes.




REVENUE RECOGNITION
                                                                                            2
              describe general principles of revenue recognition, specific revenue
              recognition applications, and implications of revenue recognition
              choices for financial analysis



General Principles
A fundamental principle of accrual accounting is that revenue is recognized (reported
on the income statement) when it is earned, so the company’s financial records reflect
revenue from the sale when the risk and reward of ownership is transferred; this is
often when the company delivers the goods or services. If the delivery was on credit, a
related asset, such as trade or accounts receivable, is created. Later, when cash changes
hands, the company’s financial records simply reflect that cash has been received to
settle an account receivable. Similarly, in some situations, a company receives cash in
advance and but delivers the product or service later, perhaps over a period of time.
In this case, the company would record a liability for unearned revenue, or deferred

                         revenue, when the cash is initially received, and revenue would be recognized over time
                         as products and services are delivered. An example would be a subscription payment
                         received in advance for cloud-based software delivered over a year.


                         Accounting Standards for Revenue Recognition
                         The converged accounting standards issued by the IASB and FASB in May 2014 intro-
                         duced some changes to the basic principles of revenue recognition. The content of the
                         two standards is nearly identical, and this discussion pertains to both, unless specified
                         otherwise. The converged standard aims to provide a principles-based approach to
                         revenue recognition that can be applied to many types of revenue-generating activities.
                             The core principle of the converged standard is that revenue should be recognized
                         to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
                         reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange
                         for those goods or services.” To achieve the core principle, the standard describes the
                         application of the following five steps in recognizing revenue:
                            1. identify the contract(s) with a customer,
                            2. identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract,
                            3. determine the transaction price,
                            4. allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract,
                               and
                            5. recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
                             According to the standard, a contract is an agreement and commitment with
                         commercial substance between the contacting parties. It establishes each party’s
                         obligations and rights, including payment terms. In addition, a contract exists only if
                         collectability is probable. Each standard uses the same wording, but the threshold for
                         probable collectability differs. Under IFRS, probable means more likely than not, and
                         under US GAAP, it means likely to occur. As a result, economically similar contracts
                         may be treated differently under IFRS and US GAAP.
                             The performance obligations within a contract represent promises to transfer
                         distinct good(s) or service(s). A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit
                         from it on its own or in combination with readily available resources and if the promise
                         to transfer it can be separated from other promises in the contract. Each identified
                         performance obligation is accounted for separately.
                             The transaction price is what the seller estimates will be received in exchange for
                         transferring the good(s) or service(s) identified in the contract. The transaction price
                         is then allocated to each identified performance obligation. Revenue is recognized
                         when a performance obligation is fulfilled. Steps three and four address amounts, and
                         step five addresses timing of recognition. The amounts recognized reflect expectations
                         about collectability and (if applicable) an allocation to multiple obligations within the
                         same contract.
                             Revenue should be recognized only when it is highly probable that it will not be
                         subsequently reversed. If it is likely to be reversed, the seller will record a minimal
                         amount of revenue upon sale and recognize a refund liability and “right to returned
                         goods” asset on the balance sheet based on the carrying amount of inventory less
                         costs of recovery.
                             The entity will recognize revenue when it is able to satisfy the performance obliga-
                         tion by transferring control of the good or service to the customer. Factors to consider
                         when assessing whether the customer has obtained control of include the following:
                            ■   entity has a present right to payment,
                            ■   customer has legal title,
Revenue Recognition                                                                          41


    ■   customer has physical possession,
    ■   customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership, and
    ■   customer has accepted the good or service.
    For a simple contract with only one deliverable at a single point in time, completing
these five steps is straight-forward. For more complex contracts—such as when the
performance obligations are satisfied over time, when the terms of the multiperiod
contracts change, or when the performance obligation includes various components
of goods and services—accounting choices are less obvious. The steps in the standards
are intended to provide guidance that can be generalized to most situations.
    If the performance obligation is satisfied at the end of these five steps, and there
is no contingency regarding payment, then revenue and accounts receivable are rec-
ognized. In cases in which revenue is recognized but the payment by the customer is
conditional on some other future performance, a contract asset is initially presented
on the balance sheet, until performance obligations are met, and a receivable can be
recognized. If consideration is received in advance of transferring good(s) or service(s),
the seller records a contract liability.
    As an analyst, you will encounter many companies with complex revenue recogni-
tion policies, reflecting the diversity of business models in practice. Several examples
adapted from real companies are discussed in Example 1.

EXAMPLE 1

   Applying the Converged Revenue Recognition Standards


   Principal Versus Agent
   MegaDigital is an online marketplace that sells goods and delivers them quickly
   to customers. For some sales, MegaDigital acts as a principal in which it controls
   the product before the goods are transferred to the customer. In other sales,
   MegaDigital acts as an agent in which it arranges for the transfer of a product
   controlled by a third-party seller. In transactions in which MegaDigital is the
   principal, revenue is recorded as the total amount of considerations received for
   the transfer of the product. In transactions in which MegaDigital is the agent,
   it records revenue only for the portion of the considerations, which amounts
   to its fee or commission. This can have a significant impact on common size
   and ratio analysis. Revenue is lower but profit margins are higher for sales for
   which MegaDigital is an agent.
       Assume MegaDigital sells a particular product as a principal for USD100 that
   it purchased for USD70. Additionally, there are USD10 of other selling, general,
   and administrative costs. The margins would be:
                                            ​




    Sales                               USD100                    100 percent
    Cost of Sales                               70                 70 percent
    Gross Profit                                30                 30 percent
    SG&A                                        10                 10 percent
    Net Profit                                  20                 20 percent
                                            ​




   If MegaDigital acts an agent for the same item with the same retail price,
   MegaDigital would receive a commission of USD30 and still incurs USD10 of
   other costs. Margins would be:

                          SG&A                                         10                 33 percent

                                                                   ​




                         For companies selling both as a principal and agent, such as many e-commerce
                         companies, an analyst would need to evaluate the relative proportion of principal
                         versus agent sales to evaluate and forecast overall margins. This is especially
                         important if the mix of principal and agent sales is expected to change.
                         Franchising/Licensing
                         Mahjong Pizza both operates and franchises pizza delivery restaurants around
                         the world. Revenue recognition standards require that the company disaggre-
                         gate revenue from contracts with customers into categories that depict how
                         the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are
                         affected by economic factors. Companies must present revenues disaggregated
                         in consolidated statements of income to satisfy this requirement. Mahjong Pizza
                         presents the following disaggregated revenue items:
                             ■    company-owned stores revenues,
                             ■    franchise royalties and fees, and
                             ■    supply chain revenues.
                             Company-owned stores revenues are of retail sales of food at stores that
                         Mahjong owns and operates.
                             Franchise royalties and fees are comprised of fees from third-party franchisees
                         that are licensed to operate Mahjong restaurants. Each franchisee is generally
                         required to pay fees equal to 5.5 percent of restaurant sales. The company recog-
                         nizes the royalty fee as revenue, not the total sales of the franchisees’ restaurants.
                         Upfront fees for opening new units are initially recognized as deferred revenue
                         and subsequently amortized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the term
                         of each respective franchise agreement, typically 10 years.
                             Supply chain revenues are primarily composed of sales of food, equipment,
                         and supplies to franchisees. Revenues are recognized upon delivery or shipment
                         of the related products to franchisees, based on shipping terms.

                         Software as a Service or License
                         CReaM Software and Services is a technology company providing customer
                         relationship management software and services to business, government and
                         not-for-profit organizations. Organizations may purchase a software license and
                         install it on their own systems. Alternatively, they may subscribe to CReaM’s
                         cloud services platform through which they can access CReaM’s software over
                         the internet for a monthly subscription fee.
                             Under IFRS 15, if a company provides a license to use software where the
                         company will take possession of the software for installation on their own system,
                         the company will report revenue either over the term of the license or at the
                         time of the transfer of the license. Companies should report the revenue from
                         the license over the term of the license, if under the contract or the company’s
                         normal business activities:
                             ■    the software provider will continue to undertake activities that signifi-
                                  cantly affect the software (e.g., upgrades/enhancements),
Revenue Recognition                                                                     43


      ■   the rights expose the customer to positive or negative impacts from
          those activities, and
      ■   the activities do not result in a transfer of goods or services.
       If these criteria are not met, then the revenue is recognized when the license
  is transferred to the customer. CReaM’s annual report footnotes state:

      Software revenues include revenues associated with term and perpetual
      software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the soft-
      ware as it exists when made available. Revenues from term and perpetual
      software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the
      software is made available to the customer. Revenue from software support
      and updates is recognized as the support and updates are provided, which
      is generally ratably over the contract term.
      Under the terms of CReaM’s license, the software is sold “as is” and rev-
  enue is recognized at the time of the license transfer. CReaM, however, also
  provides a support contract for updates for which revenue is recognized over
  the contract term.
      CReaM’s cloud clients have access to constantly updated software. CReaM
  reports:

      Cloud services allow customers to use the Company’s software without
      taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized over
      the contract term. Substantially all of the Company’s subscription service
      arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
      In the case of CReaM, an analyst must understand the composition of revenue
  between licensed software in which case revenue is recognized upfront versus
  software as a service in which case revenue is recognized over time.

  Long-Term Contracts
  Armored Vehicles Inc. (AVI) manufactures weapons systems and vehicles for
  military customers. The company enters long-term contracts that generally
  extend over several years. Performance on the contracts is satisfied over time.
  Under IFRS 15, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if one of the
  following criteria is met:
      ■   The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits pro-
          vided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (e.g., routine
          service contracts).
      ■   The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the cus-
          tomer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (e.g., refurbishment
          of a factory owned and controlled by the customer or building a road
          for a governmental agency).
      ■   The entity’s performance does not create an asset with alternative use
          to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for
          performance completed to date (e.g., construction of a large unique
          asset that may not be able to be sold to another customer such as a
          weapons system).
     AVI recognizes long-term contract revenue over the contract term as the
  work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered
  because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. For its military
  contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by
44   Learning Module 2                                                             Analyzing Income Statements


                           clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the
                           contract for convenience, pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and
                           take control of any work in process.
                               Under IFRS 15, the extent of progress towards completion may be measured
                           by output methods (e.g., appraisals or units completed) or input methods (e.g.,
                           costs incurred relative to estimated total costs). AVI reports that its accounting
                           for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales,
                           costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized
                           as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a pro-
                           portionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of
                           sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure
                           of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of
                           transfer of control to the customer.
                               As an example, AVI has a contract to produce a weapons system for a total
                           price of USD10 million. The expected total costs to produce the system is USD7
                           million and the estimated profit is USD3 million. The system will take two
                           years to produce. In Year 1 of the contract, AVI incurs USD4.2 million of costs
                           representing 60 percent of total estimated costs. AVI would recognize revenue
                           of USD6 million and profit of USD1.8 million in Year 1 (both 60 percent of
                           expected revenue and profits).
                               If in Year 2, the system is completed with actual total cumulative costs of
                           USD7.5 million, the company would report revenue of USD4 million and costs
                           of USD3.3 million for a Year 2 profit of USD0.7 million and cumulative profit
                           of USD2.5 million.

                           Bill and Hold Arrangements
                           In addition to the long-term contracts discussed previously, AVI produces cus-
                           tom armored vehicles that some customers may not be able to take possession
                           of immediately (because, for example, a lack of storage space). IFRS 15 provides
                           that in such a “bill and hold” arrangement AVI can determine when it has sat-
                           isfied its performance obligation based on when a customer obtains control
                           of the product. Under IFRS 15, this is when all the following criteria are met:
                               ■   The reason for the bill and hold arrangement must be substantive (e.g.,
                                   the customer has requested the arrangement).
                               ■   The product must be identified separately as belonging to the
                                   customer.
                               ■   The product currently must be ready for physical transfer to the
                                   customer.
                               ■   The entity cannot have the ability to use the product or to direct it to
                                   another customer.
                              In AVI’s case, each vehicle is identified by a unique vehicle identification
                           number and upon completion, title and risk of loss has passed to the customer.
                           AVI recognizes revenue when the product is ready for delivery to the customer
                           but is directed by the customer to hold delivery.

                             The disclosure requirements under IFRS 15 are quite extensive to provide sufficient
                         information to financial statement users on the nature, amount, and timing of cash
                         flows from customers. Companies are required to disclose revenue from contracts
                         with customers disaggregated into different categories of contracts. The categories
                         might be based on the type of product, the geographic region, the type of customer or
                         sales channel, the type of contract pricing terms, the contract duration, or the timing
                         of transfers. Companies are also required to disclose balances of any contract-related
Expense Recognition                                                                             45


assets and liabilities and significant changes in those balances, remaining performance
obligations and transaction price allocated to those obligations, and any significant
judgments and changes in judgments related to revenue recognition. These disclosures
are typically provided in a note to the financial statements titled “Revenue” or similar.

              recognition applications, implications of expense recognition choices

              those that are expensed in the period in which they are incurred

Assume a company purchased inventory for cash and sold the entire inventory in
the same period. When the company paid for the inventory, absent indications to
the contrary, it is clear that inventory cost was incurred and when that inventory is
sold, it should be recognized as an expense (cost of goods sold). Assume also that the
company paid all operating and administrative expenses in cash within each accounting
period. In such a simple hypothetical scenario, no issues of expense recognition would
arise. In practice, however, as with revenue recognition, determining when expenses
should be recognized can be somewhat more complex.


General Principles
In general, a company recognizes expenses in the period that it consumes (i.e., uses
up) the economic benefits associated with the expenditure, or loses some previously
recognized economic benefit. The three common expense recognition models are
as follows: the matching principle, expensing as incurred, and capitalization with
subsequent depreciation or amortization.
    Under matching, a company recognizes expenses (e.g., cost of goods sold) when
associated revenues are recognized, and thus, expenses and revenues are matched.
Associated revenues and expenses are those that result directly and jointly from the
same transactions or events. Unlike the simple scenario in which a company purchases
inventory and sells all of the inventory within the same accounting period, in prac-
tice, it is more likely that some of the current period’s sales are made from inventory
purchased in a previous period or previous periods. It is also likely that some of the
inventory purchased in the current period will remain unsold at the end of the current
period and so will be sold in a following period. Matching requires that a company
recognizes cost of goods sold in the same period as revenues from the sale of the
goods. Strictly speaking, IFRS do not refer to a “matching principle” but rather to a
“matching concept” or to a process resulting in “matching of costs with revenues.”
    Example 2 demonstrate matching applied to inventory and cost of goods sold.

   The Matching of Inventory Costs with Revenues
   Kahn Distribution Limited (KDL), a hypothetical company, purchases inventory
   items for resale. At the beginning of 20X1, Kahn had no inventory on hand.
   During 20X1, KDL had the following transactions:

                           Inventory Purchases
                          First quarter              2,000     units at USD40 per unit
                          Second quarter             1,500     units at USD41 per unit
                          Third quarter              2,200     units at USD43 per unit
                          Fourth quarter             1,900     units at USD45 per unit
                          Total                      7,600     units at a total cost of USD321,600
                                                                   ​




                             KDL sold 5,600 units of inventory during the year at USD50 per unit and
                         received cash. KDL determines that there were 2,000 remaining units of inventory
                         and specifically identifies that 1,900 were those purchased in the fourth quarter
                         and 100 were purchased in the third quarter.

                         1. What are the revenue and expense associated with these transactions during
                            20X1 based on specific identification of inventory items as sold or remaining
                            in inventory? (Assume that the company does not expect any products to be
                            returned.)
                           Solution:
                           The revenue for 20X1 would be USD280,000 (5,600 units × USD50 per unit).
                           Initially, the total cost of the goods purchased would be recorded as inven-
                           tory (an asset) in the amount of USD321,600. During 20X1, the cost of the
                           5,600 units sold would be expensed (matched against the revenue) while
                           the cost of the 2,000 remaining unsold units would remain in inventory as
                           follows:

                          From the second quarter       1,500 units at USD41 per unit =       USD61,500
                          From the third quarter        2,100 units at USD43 per unit =       USD90,300

                           Cost of Goods Remaining in Inventory
                          From the third quarter        100 units at USD43 per unit =             USD4,300
                          From the fourth quarter       1,900 units at USD45 per unit =       USD85,500
                          Total remaining (or ending) inventory cost                          USD89,800
                                                                   ​




                           To confirm that total costs are accounted for: USD231,800 + USD89,800
                           = USD321,600. The cost of the goods sold would be expensed against the
                           revenue of USD280,000 as follows:
                                                                   ​

                          Cost of Goods Sold                                            231,800
                          Gross Profit                                                   48,200
                                                                   ​




                           An alternative way to think about this is that the company created an asset
                           (inventory) of USD321,600 as it made its purchases. At the end of the peri-
                           od, the value of the company’s inventory on hand is USD89,800. Therefore,
                           the amount of the Cost of goods sold expense recognized for the period
                           should be the difference: USD231,800.
                           The remaining inventory amount of USD89,800 will be matched against
                           revenue in a future year when the inventory items are sold.
Expense Recognition                                                                        47


    Period costs, expenditures that less directly match revenues, are generally expensed
as incurred (i.e., either when the company makes the expenditure in cash or incurs
the liability to pay). Costs associated with administrative, managerial, information
technology (IT), and research and development activities as well as the maintenance
or repair of assets generally fit this model. For most companies, payroll expenses are
accounted for this way, excluding employees whose compensation is considered a
product cost and recognized as inventory and later cost of goods sold or items like
sales commissions, which are capitalized and expensed systematically or with sales.


Capitalization versus Expensing
Finally, certain expenditures are capitalized as assets on the balance sheet and typi-
cally appear as an investing cash outflow on the statement of cash flows. After initial
recognition, a company expenses the capitalized amount over the asset’s useful life
as depreciation or amortization expense (except assets that are not depreciated, i.e.,
land, or amortized, e.g., intangible assets with indefinite lives). This expense reduces
net income on the income statement and reduces the value of the asset on the balance
sheet. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses and therefore, apart
from their effect on taxable income and taxes payable, they have no impact on the
cash flow statement.
    This model is a form of the matching principle, whereby expenses are recognized
on the income statement over the expected useful life of the investment, so the costs
and benefits are “matched.” Example 3 illustrates the impact on the financial statements
of capitalizing versus expensing an expenditure.

EXAMPLE 3

  General Financial Statement Impact of Capitalizing versus
  Expensing
  Assume two identical (hypothetical) companies, CAP Inc. (CAP) and NOW
  Inc. (NOW), start with EUR1,000 cash and EUR1,000 common stock. Each
  year the companies recognize total revenues of EUR1,500 cash and make cash
  expenditures, excluding an equipment purchase, of EUR500. At the beginning of
  operations, each company pays EUR900 to purchase equipment. CAP estimates
  the equipment will have a useful life of three years and an estimated salvage
  value of EUR0 at the end of the three years. NOW estimates a much shorter
  useful life and expenses the equipment immediately. The companies have no
  other assets and make no other asset purchases during the three-year period.
  Assume the companies pay no dividends, earn zero interest on cash balances,
  have a tax rate of 30 percent, and use the same accounting method for financial
  and tax purposes.
      The left side of Exhibit 1 shows CAP’s financial statements—that is, with
  the expenditure capitalized and depreciated at EUR300 per year based on the
  straight-line method of depreciation (EUR900 cost minus EUR0 salvage value
  equals EUR900, divided by a three-year life equals EUR300 per year). The right
  side of the exhibit shows NOW’s financial statements, with the entire EUR900
  expenditure treated as an expense in the first year. All amounts are in euro.

                                         1. Which company reports higher net income over the three years? Total cash
                                            flow? Cash from operations?
                                              Solution:
                                              Neither company reports higher total net income or cash flow over the three
                                              years. The sum of net income over the three years is identical (EUR1,470
                                              total) whether the EUR900 is capitalized or expensed. Also, the sum of the
                                              change in cash (EUR1,470 total) is identical under either scenario. CAP re-
                                              ports higher cash from operations by an amount of EUR900 because, under
                                              the capitalization scenario, the EUR900 purchase is treated as an investing
                                              cash flow.
                                              Note: Because the companies use the same accounting method for both
                                              financial and taxable income, absent the assumption of zero interest on cash
                                              balances, expensing the EUR900 would have resulted in higher income and
                                              cash flow for NOW because the lower taxes paid in the first year (EUR30
                                              versus EUR210) would have allowed NOW to earn interest income on the
                                              tax savings.

  2. Based on ROE and net profit margin, how does the profitability of the two
     companies compare?
     Solution:
     In general, Ending shareholders’ equity = Beginning shareholders’ equity
     + Net income + Other comprehensive income – Dividends + Net capital
     contributions from shareholders. Because the companies in this example do
     not have other comprehensive income, did not pay dividends, and report-
     ed no capital contributions from shareholders, Ending retained earnings =
     Beginning retained earnings + Net income, and Ending shareholders’ equity
     = Beginning shareholders’ equity + Net income.
     ROE is calculated as Net income divided by Average shareholders’ equity,
     and Net profit margin is calculated as Net income divided by Total reve-
     nue. For example, CAP had Year 1 ROE of 39 percent (EUR490/[(EUR1,000
     + EUR1,490)/2]), and Year 1 net profit margin of 33 percent (EUR490/
     EUR1,500).
                                            ​

       Capitalize EUR900 as Asset and               Expense EUR900 Immediately
                 Depreciate

    For Year              1     2       3       For Year            1     2      3

    ROE                  39%   28%   22%        ROE                 7%   49%   33%
    Net Profit Margin    33%   33%   33%        Net Profit Margin   5%   47%   47%
                                            ​




     As shown, compared to expensing, capitalizing results in higher profitability
     ratios (ROE and net profit margin) in the first year, and lower profitability
     ratios in subsequent years. For example, CAP’s Year 1 ROE of 39 percent
     was higher than NOW’s Year 1 ROE of 7 percent, but in Years 2 and 3,
     NOW reports superior profitability.
     Note also that NOW’s superior growth in net income between Year 1 and
     Year 2 is not attributable to superior performance compared to CAP but
     rather to the accounting decision to recognize the expense sooner than CAP.
     In general, all else equal, accounting decisions that result in recognizing
     expenses sooner will give the appearance of greater subsequent growth.
     Comparison of the growth of the two companies’ net incomes without an
     awareness of the difference in accounting methods would be misleading.
     As a corollary, NOW’s income and profitability exhibit greater volatility
     across the three years, not because of more volatile performance but rather
     because of the different accounting decision.

  3. Why does NOW report change in cash of EUR70 in Year 1, while CAP
     reports total change in cash of (EUR110)?
     Solution:
     NOW reports an increase in cash of EUR70 in Year 1, while CAP reports a
     decrease in cash of EUR110 because NOW’s taxes were EUR180 lower than
     CAP’s taxes (EUR30 versus EUR210).
     Note that this problem assumes the accounting method used by each
     company for its tax purposes is identical to the accounting method used by
     the company for its financial reporting. In many countries, companies are
     allowed to use different depreciation methods for financial reporting and
     taxes, which may give rise to deferred taxes.

                              As shown, discretion regarding whether to expense or capitalize expenditures can
                         impede comparability across companies. Example 4 assumes the companies purchase
                         a single asset in one year. Because the sum of net income over the three-year period
                         is identical whether the asset is capitalized or expensed, it illustrates that although
                         capitalizing results in higher profitability compared with expensing in the first year,
                         it results in lower profitability in the subsequent years. Conversely, expensing results
                         in lower profitability in the first year but higher profitability in later years, indicating
                         a favorable trend.
                              Similarly, shareholders’ equity for a company that capitalizes the expenditure will
                         be higher in the early years because the initially higher profits result in initially higher
                         retained earnings. Example 4 assumes the companies purchase a single asset in one
                         year and report identical amounts of total net income over the three-year period, so
                         shareholders’ equity (and retained earnings) for the firm that expenses will be identical
                         to shareholders’ equity (and retained earnings) for the capitalizing firm at the end of
                         the three-year period.
                              Although Example 3 shows companies purchasing an asset only in the first year,
                         if a company continues to purchase similar or increasing amounts of assets each
                         year, the profitability-enhancing effect of capitalizing continues if the amount of the
                         expenditures in a period continues to be more than the depreciation expense. Example
                         4 illustrates this point.

                         EXAMPLE 4

                            Impact of Capitalizing versus Expensing for Ongoing
                            Purchases
                            A company buys a GBP300 computer in Year 1 and capitalizes the expenditure.
                            The computer has a useful life of three years and an expected salvage value of
                            GBP0, so the annual depreciation expense using the straight-line method is
                            GBP100 per year. Compared with expensing the entire GBP300 immediately,
                            the company’s pre-tax profit in Year 1 is GBP200 greater.

                            1. Assume that the company continues to buy an identical computer each year
                               at the same price. If the company uses the same accounting treatment for
                               each of the computers, when does the profit-enhancing effect of capitalizing
                               versus expensing end?
                               Solution:
                               The profit-enhancing effect of capitalizing versus expensing would end in
                               Year 3. In Year 3, the depreciation expense on each of the three comput-
                               ers bought in Years 1, 2, and 3 would total GBP300 (GBP100 + GBP100 +
                               GBP100). Therefore, the total depreciation expense for Year 3 will be exactly
                               equal to the capital expenditure in Year 3. The expense in Year 3 would be
                               GBP300, regardless of whether the company capitalized or expensed the
                               annual computer purchases.

                            2. If the company buys another identical computer in Year 4, using the same
                               accounting treatment as the prior years, what is the effect on Year 4 profits
                               of capitalizing versus expensing these expenditures?
                               Solution:
                               There is no impact on Year 4 profits. As in the previous year, the depreci-
                               ation expense on each of the three computers bought in Years 2, 3, and 4
                               would total GBP300 (GBP100 + GBP100 + GBP100). Therefore, the total de-
                               preciation expense for Year 4 will be exactly equal to the capital expenditure
Expense Recognition                                                                       51


     in Year 4. Pre-tax profits would be reduced by GBP300, regardless of wheth-
     er the company capitalized or expensed the annual computer purchases.

    Compared with expensing an expenditure, capitalizing the expenditure typically
results in greater amounts reported as cash from operations. Analysts should be
alert to evidence of companies manipulating reported cash flow from operations by
capitalizing expenditures that should be expensed.
    In summary, holding all else constant, capitalizing an expenditure enhances
current profitability and increases reported cash flow from operations. The prof-
itability-enhancing effect of capitalizing continues so long as capital expenditures
exceed the depreciation expense. Profitability-enhancing motivations for decisions
to capitalize should be considered when analyzing performance. For example, a
company may choose to capitalize more expenditures (within the allowable bounds
of accounting standards) to achieve earnings targets for a given period. Expensing
a cost in the period reduces current period profits but enhances future profitability
and thus enhances the profit trend. Profit trend-enhancing motivations should also be
considered when analyzing performance. If the company is in a reporting environment
that requires identical accounting methods for financial reporting and taxes (unlike
the United States, which permits companies to use depreciation methods for reporting
purposes that differ from the depreciation method required by tax purposes), then
expensing will have a more favorable cash flow impact because paying lower taxes in
an earlier period creates an opportunity to earn interest income on the cash saved.
    In contrast with these relatively simple examples, it is generally neither possible
nor desirable to identify individual instances involving discretion about whether
to capitalize or expense expenditures. An analyst can, however, typically identify
significant items of expenditure treated differently across companies. The items of
expenditure giving rise to the most relevant differences across companies will vary
by industry. This cross-industry variation is apparent in the following discussion of
the capitalization of expenditures.

CAPITALIZATION VERSUS EXPENSING


  1. All else equal, in the fiscal year when long-lived equipment is
     purchased:
      A. depreciation expense increases.
      B. cash from operations decreases.
      C. net income is reduced by the amount of the purchase.
     Solution:
     A is correct. In the fiscal year when long-lived equipment is purchased,
     the assets on the balance sheet increase and depreciation expense on the
     income statement increases because of the new long-lived asset.

  2. Companies X and Z have the same beginning-of-the-year book value of
     equity and the same tax rate. The companies have identical transactions
     throughout the year and report all transactions similarly except for one.
     Both companies acquire a GBP300,000 printer with a three-year useful life
     and a salvage value of GBP0 on 1 January of the new year. Company X cap-

                           Z expenses the printer. The year-end information in Exhibit 2 is gathered for

                           Based on the information in Exhibit 2, Company Z’s return on equity using
                           year-end equity will be closest to:
                            A. 5.4 percent.
                            B. 6.1 percent.
                            C. 7.5 percent.
                           Solution:
                           B is correct. Company Z’s return on equity based on year-end equity value
                           will be 6.1 percent. Company Z will have an additional GBP200,000 of
                           expenses compared with Company X. Company Z expensed the printer for
                           GBP300,000 rather than capitalizing the printer and having a depreciation
                           expense of GBP100,000 like Company X. Company Z’s net income and
                           shareholders’ equity will be GBP150,000 lower (= GBP200,000 × 0.75) than
                           that of Company X.

                         The following information relates to questions 3-6.
                            Melanie Hart, CFA, is a transportation analyst. Hart has been asked to write
                         a research report on Altai Mountain Rail Company (AMRC). Like other com-
                         panies in the railroad industry, AMRC’s operations are capital intensive, with
                         significant investments in such long-lived tangible assets as property, plant, and
                         equipment. In November 2008, AMRC’s board of directors hired a new team to
                         manage the company. In reviewing the company’s 2009 annual report, Hart is
                         concerned about some of the accounting choices that the new management has
                         made. These choices differ from those of the previous management and from
                         common industry practice. Hart has highlighted the following statements from
                         the company’s annual report:

                                       3. With respect to Statement 1, which of the following is the most likely ef-
                                          fect of management’s decision to expense rather than capitalize these
                                          expenditures?
                                          A. 2009 net profit margin is higher than if the expenditures had been
                                             capitalized.
                                          B. 2009 total asset turnover is lower than if the expenditures had been
                                             capitalized.
                                          C. Future profit growth will be higher than if the expenditures had been
                                             capitalized.
                                         Solution:
                                         C is correct. Expensing rather than capitalizing an investment in long-term
                                         assets will result in higher expenses and lower net income and net profit
                                         margin in the current year. Future years’ incomes will not include depre-
                                         ciation expense related to these expenditures. Consequently, year-to-year
                                         growth in profitability will be higher. If the expenses had been capitalized,
                                         the carrying amount of the assets would have been higher and the 2009 total
                                         asset turnover would have been lower.

                                       4. With respect to Statement 2, what would be the most likely effect in 2010 if
                                          AMRC were to switch to an accelerated depreciation method for both finan-
                                          cial and tax reporting?
                                          A. Net profit margin would increase.
                                          B. Total asset turnover would decrease.
                                          C. Cash flow from operating activities would increase.
                                         Solution:
                                         C is correct. In 2010, switching to an accelerated depreciation method
                                         would increase depreciation expense and decrease income before taxes,
                                         taxes payable, and net income. Cash flow from operating activities would
                                         increase because of the resulting tax savings.

                                       5. With respect to Statement 3, what is the most likely effect of the impairment
                                          loss?
                                          A. Net income in years prior to 2009 was likely understated.
                                          B. Net profit margins in years after 2009 will likely exceed the 2009 net
                                             profit margin.
Expense Recognition                                                                         55


       C. Cash flow from operating activities in 2009 was likely lower due to the
          impairment loss.
      Solution:
      B is correct. 2009 net income and net profit margin are lower because of the
      impairment loss. Consequently, net profit margins in subsequent years are
      likely to be higher. An impairment loss suggests that insufficient deprecia-
      tion expense was recognized in prior years, and net income was overstated
      in prior years. The impairment loss is a non-cash item and will not affect
      operating cash flows.

   6. Based on Exhibit 1 and 2, the best estimate of the average remaining useful
      life of the company’s plant and equipment at the end of 2009 is:
      A. 20.75 years.
      B. 24.25 years.
       C. 30.00 years.
      Solution:
      A is correct. The estimated average remaining useful life is 20.75 years.
      Estimate of remaining useful life = Net plant and equipment ÷ Annual de-
      preciation expense
      Net plant and equipment = Gross P & E – Accumulated depreciation
      = €6000 – €1850 = €4150
      Estimate of remaining useful life = Net P & E ÷ Depreciation expense
      = €4150 ÷ €200 = 20.75



Capitalization of Interest Costs
Companies generally must capitalize interest costs associated with acquiring or con-
structing an asset that requires a long period of time to get ready for its intended use
    As a consequence of this accounting treatment, a company’s interest costs for a
period can appear either on the balance sheet (to the extent they are capitalized) or
on the income statement (to the extent they are expensed).
    If the interest expenditure is incurred in connection with constructing an asset
for the company’s own use, the capitalized interest appears on the balance sheet as
a part of the relevant long-lived asset. The capitalized interest is expensed over time
as the property is depreciated—and is thus part of depreciation expense rather than
interest expense. If the interest expenditure is incurred in connection with constructing
an asset to sell, for example, by a real estate construction company, the capitalized
interest appears on the company’s balance sheet as part of inventory. The capitalized
interest is then expensed as part of the cost of sales when the asset is sold.
    The treatment of capitalized interest poses certain issues that analysts should
consider. First, capitalized interest appears as part of investing cash outflows, whereas
expensed interest typically reduces operating cash flow. US GAAP–reporting com-
panies are required to categorize interest in operating cash flow, and IFRS-reporting
companies can categorize interest in operating, investing, or financing cash flows.
Although the treatment is consistent with accounting standards, an analyst may want
to examine the impact on reported cash flows. Second, interest coverage ratios are
solvency indicators measuring the extent to which a company’s earnings (or cash flow)
in a period covered its interest costs. To provide a true picture of a company’s interest
coverage, the entire amount of interest expenditure, both the capitalized portion and
the expensed portion, should be used to calculate interest coverage ratios. Additionally,
56   Learning Module 2                                                                       Analyzing Income Statements


                         if a company is depreciating interest that it capitalized in a previous period, income
                         should be adjusted to eliminate the effect of that depreciation. Example 5 illustrates
                         the calculations.

                           Total interest expenses incurred amounted to $267,065, $252,600, and $253,168,
                           of which $37,483, $29,033, and $134,838 were capitalized during the years ended
                           December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Amortization of deferred
                           financing costs of $26,182, $48,345, and $38,511, net of amortization capitalized
                           of nil, nil, and $5,458, were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017,

                           1. Calculate and interpret Melco’s interest coverage ratio with and without
                              capitalized interest.
                              Solution:
                              Interest coverage ratios with and without capitalized interest were as
                              follows:

                                For 2017

                                    2.37 (USD544,865 ÷ USD229,582) without adjusting for capitalized
                                    interest; and
Expense Recognition                                                                        57


           2.14 [(USD544,865 + USD26,182) ÷ (USD229,582 + USD37,483)],
           including an adjustment to EBIT for depreciation of previously capi-
           talized interest and an adjustment to interest expense for the amount
           of interest capitalized in 2017.

       For 2016

           1.34 (USD298,663÷ USD223,567) without adjusting for capitalized
           interest; and

           1.37 [(USD298,663 + USD48,345) ÷ (USD223,567 + USD29,033)],
           including an adjustment to EBIT for depreciation of previously capi-
           talized interest and an adjustment to interest expense for the amount
           of interest capitalized in 2016.

       For 2015

           0.49 (USD58,533÷ USD118,330) without adjusting for capitalized
           interest; and

           0.38 [(USD58,533 + USD38,511) ÷ (USD118,330+ USD134,838)],
           including an adjustment to EBIT for depreciation of previously capi-
           talized interest and an adjustment to interest expense for the amount
           of interest capitalized in 2015.
     These calculations indicate that Melco’s interest coverage improved in 2017
     compared with the previous two years. In both 2017 and 2015, the coverage
     ratio was lower when adjusted for capitalized interest.

  2. Calculate Melco’s percentage change in operating cash flow from 2016 to
     2017. Assuming the financial reporting does not affect reporting for income
     taxes, what were the effects of capitalized interest on operating and invest-
     ing cash flows?
     Solution:
     If the interest had been expensed rather than capitalized, operating cash
     flows would have been lower in all three years. On an adjusted basis, but
     not an unadjusted basis, the company’s operating cash flow declined in
     2017 compared with 2016. On an unadjusted basis, for 2017 compared
     with 2016, Melco’s operating cash flow increased by 0.4 percent in 2017
     [(USD1,162,500 ÷ USD1,158,128) – 1]. Including adjustments to expense all
     interest costs, Melco’s operating cash flow also decreased by 0.4 percent in
     2017 {[USD1,162,500 – USD37,483) ÷ (USD1,158,128 – USD29,033)] – 1}.
     If the interest had been expensed rather than capitalized, financing cash
     flows would have been higher in all three years.

    The treatment of capitalized interest raises issues for consideration by an analyst.
First, capitalized interest appears as part of investing cash outflows, whereas expensed
interest reduces operating or financing cash flow under IFRS and operating cash flow
under US GAAP. An analyst may want to examine the impact on reported cash flows
of interest expenditures when comparing companies. Second, interest coverage ratios
are solvency indicators measuring the extent to which a company’s earnings (or cash
flow) in a period covered its interest costs. To provide a true picture of a company’s
interest coverage, the entire amount of interest, both the capitalized portion and the
expensed portion, should be used in calculating interest coverage ratios.

                             Generally, including capitalized interest in the calculation of interest coverage
                         ratios provides a better assessment of a company’s solvency. In assigning credit ratings,
                         rating agencies include capitalized interest in coverage ratios. For example, Standard
                         & Poor’s calculates the EBIT interest coverage ratio as EBIT divided by gross interest
                         (defined as interest prior to deductions for capitalized interest or interest income).
                             Maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio is a financial covenant often
                         included in lending agreements (e.g., bank loans and bond indentures). The definition
                         of the coverage ratio can be found in the company’s credit agreement. The definition is
                         relevant because treatment of capitalized interest in calculating coverage ratios would
                         affect an assessment of how close a company’s actual ratios are to the levels specified
                         by its financial covenants and thus the probability of breaching those covenants.


                         Capitalization of Internal Development Costs
                         Accounting standards require companies to capitalize software development costs after
                         a product’s feasibility is established. Despite this requirement, judgment in determin-
                         ing feasibility means that companies’ capitalization practices may differ. For example,
                         as illustrated in Exhibit 6, Microsoft judges product feasibility to be established very
                         shortly before manufacturing begins and, therefore, effectively expenses—rather than
                         capitalizes—research and development costs.

                            Excerpt from Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of Microsoft
                            Corporation, Application of Critical Accounting Policies, Research and
                            Development Costs:

                                 Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer soft-
                                 ware product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has
                                 been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is estab-
                                 lished, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for
                                 general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when
                                 technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined
                                 that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after
                                 all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and
                                 testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to
                                 production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue
                                 over the estimated life of the products.

                             Expensing rather than capitalizing development costs results in lower net income
                         in the current period. Expensing rather than capitalizing will continue to result in
                         lower net income so long as the amount of the current-period development expenses
                         is higher than the amortization expense that would have resulted from amortizing
                         prior periods’ capitalized development costs—the typical situation when a company’s
                         development costs are increasing. On the statement of cash flows, expensing rather
                         than capitalizing development costs results in lower net operating cash flows and
                         higher net investing cash flows. This is because the development costs are reflected
                         as operating cash outflows rather than investing cash outflows.
                             In comparing the financial performance of a company that expenses most or all
                         software development costs, such as Microsoft, with another company that capitalizes
                         software development costs, adjustments can be made to make the two comparable.
                         For the company that capitalizes software development costs, an analyst can adjust
                         (1) the income statement to include software development costs as an expense and to
Expense Recognition                                                                                              59


exclude amortization of prior years’ software development costs; (2) the balance sheet
to exclude capitalized software (decrease assets and equity); and (3) the statement of
cash flows to decrease operating cash flows and decrease cash used in investing by
the amount of the current period development costs. Any ratios that include income,
long-lived assets, or cash flow from operations—such as return on equity—also will
be affected.

                                         A. Based on the information as reported, the P/E ratio was 30.0 (USD42
                                            ÷ USD1.40). Based on EPS adjusted to expense software development
                                            costs, the P/E ratio was 42.9 (USD42 ÷ USD0.98).
                                             Price: Assuming that the market value of the company’s equity is
                                             based on its fundamentals, the price per share is USD42, regardless of
                                             a difference in accounting.
                                             EPS: As reported, EPS was USD1.40. Adjusted EPS was USD0.98.
                                             Expensing software development costs would have reduced JHH’s
                                             2018 operating income by USD6,000, but the company would have
                                             reported no amortization of prior years’ software costs, which would
                                             have increased operating income by USD2,000. The net change of
                                             USD4,000 would have reduced operating income from the reported
                                             USD13,317 to USD9,317. The effective tax rate for 2018 (USD3,825 ÷
                                             USD13,317) is 28.72%, and using this effective tax rate would give an
                                             adjusted net income of USD6,641 [USD9,317 × (1 – 0.2872)], com-
                                             pared to USD9,492 before the adjustment. The EPS would therefore be
                                             reduced from the reported USD1.40 to USD0.98 (adjusted net income
                                             of USD6,641 divided by 6,780 shares).
Expense Recognition                                                                         61


      B. Based on information as reported, the P/CFO was 19.0 (USD42 ÷
         USD2.21). Based on CFO adjusted to expense software development
         costs, the P/CFO was 31.6 (USD42 ÷ USD1.33).
          Price: Assuming that the market value of the company’s equity is
          based on its fundamentals, the price per share is USD42, regardless of
          a difference in accounting.
          CFO per share, as reported, was USD2.21 (total operating cash flows
          USD15,007 ÷ 6,780 shares).
          CFO per share, as adjusted, was USD1.33. The company’s USD6,000
          expenditure on software development costs was reported as a cash
          outflow from investing activities, so expensing those costs would
          reduce cash from operating activities by USD6,000, from the reported
          USD15,007 to USD9,007. Dividing adjusted total operating cash flow
          of USD9,007 by 6,780 shares results in cash flow per share of USD1.33.
      C. Based on information as reported, the EV/EBITDA was 16.3
         (USD284,760 ÷ USD17,517). Based on EBITDA adjusted to expense
         software development costs, the EV/EBITDA was 24.7 (USD284,760 ÷
         USD11,517).
          Enterprise Value: Enterprise value is the sum of the market value of
          the company’s equity and debt. JHH has no debt, and therefore the
          enterprise value is equal to the market value of its equity. The market
          value of its equity is USD284,760 (USD42 per share × 6,780 shares).
          EBITDA, as reported, was USD17,517 (earnings before interest and
          taxes of USD13,317 plus USD2,200 depreciation plus USD2,000
          amortization).
          EBITDA, adjusted for expensing software development costs by the
          inclusion of USD6,000 development expense and the exclusion of
          USD2,000 amortization of prior expense, would be USD11,517 (earn-
          ings before interest and taxes of USD9,317 plus USD2,200 deprecia-
          tion plus USD0 amortization).

   2. Interpret the changes in the ratios.
      Solution:
      Expensing software development costs would decrease historical profits,
      operating cash flow, and EBITDA, and would thus increase all market multi-
      ples. So JHH’s stock would appear to be more expensive if it expensed rather
      than capitalized the software development costs.
      If the unadjusted market-based ratios were used in the comparison of JHH
      to its competitor that expenses all software development expenditures, then
      JHH might appear to be under-priced when the difference is solely related
      to accounting factors. JHH’s adjusted market-based ratios provide a better
      basis for comparison.

    For the company in Example 6, current period software development expenditures
exceed the amortization of prior periods’ capitalized software development expendi-
tures. As a result, expensing rather than capitalizing software development costs would
have the effect of lowering income. If, however, software development expenditures
slowed such that current expenditures were lower than the amortization of prior
periods’ capitalized software development expenditures, then expensing software
development costs would have the effect of increasing income relative to capitalizing it.

                             This section illustrated how decisions about capitalizing versus expensing affect
                         financial statements and ratios. Earlier expensing lowers current profits but enhances
                         trends, whereas capitalizing now and expensing later enhances current profits. Having
                         described the accounting for acquisition of long-lived assets, we now turn to the topic
                         of measuring long-lived assets in subsequent periods.


                         Implications for Financial Analysts: Expense Recognition
                         As with revenue recognition policies, a company’s choice of expense recognition can
                         be characterized by its relative conservatism. A policy that results in recognition of
                         expenses later rather than sooner is considered less conservative. In addition, many
                         items of expense require the company to make estimates that can significantly affect
                         net income. Analysis of a company’s financial statements, and particularly comparison
                         of one company’s financial statements with those of another, requires an understanding
                         of differences in these estimates and their potential impact.
                              If, for example, a company shows a significant year-to-year change in its estimates
                         of uncollectible accounts as a percentage of sales, warranty expenses as a percentage
                         of sales, or estimated useful lives of assets, the analyst should seek to understand the
                         underlying reasons. Do the changes reflect a change in business operations (e.g., lower
                         estimated warranty expenses reflecting recent experience of fewer warranty claims
                         because of improved product quality)? Or are the changes seemingly unrelated to
                         changes in business operations and thus possibly a signal that a company is manipu-
                         lating estimates to achieve a particular effect on its reported net income?
                              As another example, if two companies in the same industry have dramatically
                         different estimates for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of their sales, warranty
                         expenses as a percentage of sales, or estimated useful lives as a percentage of assets,
                         it is important to understand the underlying reasons. Are the differences consistent
                         with differences in the two companies’ business operations (e.g., lower uncollectible
                         accounts for one company reflecting a different, more creditworthy customer base
                         or possibly stricter credit policies)? Another difference consistent with differences in
                         business operations would be a difference in estimated useful lives of assets if one
                         of the companies employs newer equipment. Or, alternatively, are the differences
                         seemingly inconsistent with differences in the two companies’ business operations,
                         possibly signaling that a company is manipulating estimates?
                              Information about a company’s accounting policies and significant estimates are
                         described in the notes to the financial statements and in the management discussion
                         and analysis section of a company’s annual report.
                              When possible, the monetary effect of differences in expense recognition policies
                         and estimates can facilitate more meaningful comparisons with a single company’s
                         historical performance or across a number of companies. An analyst can use the mon-
                         etary effect to adjust the reported expenses so that they are on a comparable basis.
                              Even when the monetary effects of differences in policies and estimates cannot
                         be calculated, it is generally possible to characterize the relative conservatism of the
                         policies and estimates and, therefore, to qualitatively assess how such differences
                         might affect reported expenses and thus financial ratios.
Non-Recurring Items                                                                             63



NON-RECURRING ITEMS
                                                                                            4
              describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of
              non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or
              infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies

From a company’s income statements, we can see its earnings from the year just ended
and the previous year. Looking forward, the question is: What will the company earn
next year and in the years thereafter?
    To assess a company’s future earnings, it is helpful to separate those prior years’
items of income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items
that are less likely to continue. Some items from prior years are clearly not expected
to continue in the future periods and are separately disclosed on a company’s income
statement. IFRS describe considerations that enter into the decision to present infor-
mation other than that explicitly specified by a standard. Both IFRS and US GAAP
specify that the results of discontinued operations should be reported separately from
continuing operations. Other items that may be reported separately on a company’s
income statement, such as unusual items, items that occur infrequently, effects due
to accounting changes, and non-operating income, require the analyst to make some
judgments.


Unusual or Infrequent Items
IFRS require that items of income or expense that are material or relevant to the under-
standing of the entity’s financial performance should be disclosed separately. Unusual
or infrequent items are likely to meet these criteria. Under US GAAP, material items
that are unusual or infrequent, and that are both as of reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2015, are shown as part of a company’s continuing operations but
are presented separately. For example, restructuring charges, such as costs to close
plants and employee termination costs, are considered part of a company’s ordinary
activities. As another example, gains and losses arising when a company sells an asset
or part of a business, for more or less than its carrying value, are also disclosed sepa-
rately on the income statement. These sales are considered ordinary business activities.
    Highlighting the unusual or infrequent nature of these items assists an analyst
in judging the likelihood that such items will reoccur. This meets the IFRS criteria
of disclosing items that are relevant to the understanding of an entity’s financial
performance. In Exhibit 8, the income statement of Danone shows an amount for
“Recurring operating income” followed by a separate line item for “other operating
income (expense),” which is not included as a component of recurring income. Exhibit
9 presents an excerpt from Danone’s additional disclosure about this non-recurring
amount.

                            [Excerpt]

                                 Other operating income (expense) is defined under Recommendation 2013-
                                 03 of the French CNC relating to the format of consolidated financial state-
                                 ments prepared under international accounting standards, and comprises
                                 significant items that, because of their exceptional nature, cannot be viewed
                                 as inherent to Danone’s current activities. These mainly include capital
                                 gains and losses on disposals of fully consolidated companies, impairment
                                 charges on goodwill, significant costs related to strategic restructuring
                                 and major external growth transactions, and incurred or estimated costs
                                 related to major crises and major litigation. Furthermore, in connection
                                 with Revised IFRS 3 and Revised IAS 27, Danone also classifies in Other
                                 operating income (expense) (i) acquisition costs related to business com-
                                 binations, (ii) revaluation profit or loss accounted for following a loss of
                                 control, and (iii) changes in earn-outs related to business combinations

          Specialized Nutrition Reporting entities

Remainder of table omitted


    In Exhibit 9, Danone provides details on items considered to be “exceptional” items
and not “inherent” to the company’s current activities. The exceptional items include
gains on asset disposals, receipts from a legal case, costs of integrating an acquisition,
and impairment of intangible assets, among others. Generally, in forecasting future
operations, an analyst would assess whether the items reported are likely to reoccur
and also possible implications for future earnings. It is generally not advisable simply
to ignore all unusual items.


Discontinued Operations
When a company disposes of or establishes a plan to dispose of one of its component
operations and will have no further involvement in the operation, the income state-
ment reports separately the effect of this disposal as a “discontinued” operation under
both IFRS and US GAAP. Financial standards provide various criteria for reporting
the effect separately, which are generally that the discontinued component must be
separable both physically and operationally.
    Results of discontinued operations are presented on a net basis at the bottom of
the income statement, including on a per share basis. The remaining parts of income
statement (e.g., revenue, costs of goods sold, EPS from the remaining businesses) are
the results of continuing operations and are disclosed as such. Assets and liabilities
related to the discontinued operations are aggregated and recognized on the balance
sheet as held for sale. This presentation allows an analyst to clearly evaluate continuing
versus discontinued operations.
    Because the discontinued operation will no longer provide earnings (or cash flow)
to the company once the sale or disposal is complete, an analyst may eliminate dis-
continued operations in formulating expectations about a company’s future financial
performance after a certain date.


Changes in Accounting Policy
At times, standard setters issue new standards that require companies to change
accounting policies. Depending on the standard, companies may be permitted to
adopt the standards prospectively (in the future) or retrospectively (restate financial
statements as though the standard existed in the past). In other cases, changes in
accounting policies (e.g., from one acceptable inventory costing method to another)
66   Learning Module 2                                                                      Analyzing Income Statements


                         are made by management for various reasons, such as providing a better reflection
                         of the company’s performance. Changes in accounting policies are reported through
                         retrospective application1 unless it is impractical to do so.
                             Retrospective application means that the financial statements for all fiscal years
                         shown in a company’s financial report are presented as if the newly adopted accounting
                         principle had been used throughout the entire period. Notes to the financial statements
                         describe the change and explain the justification for the change. Because changes in
                         accounting principles are retrospectively applied, the financial statements that appear
                         within a financial report are comparable.
                             Example 7 presents an excerpt from Microsoft Corporation’s Form 10-K for the
                         fiscal year ended 30 June 2018 describing a change in accounting principle resulting
                         from the new revenue recognition standard. Microsoft elected to adopt the new
                         standard 1 July 2017, earlier than the required adoption date. Microsoft also elected
                         to use the “full retrospective method,” which requires companies to restate prior
                         periods’ results. On its income statement, both 2016 and 2017 are presented as if the
                         new standard had been used throughout both years. In the footnotes to its financial
                         statements, Microsoft discloses the impact of the new standard.

                            The most significant impact of the [new revenue recognition] standard relates
                            to our accounting for software license revenue. Specifically, for Windows 10,
                            we recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather
                            than ratably over the life of the related device. For certain multi-year commercial
                            software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and SA, we
                            recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over the
                            subscription period. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license
                            subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under
                            the standard depends on contract-specific terms and in some instances may
                            vary from recognition at the time of billing. Revenue recognition related to our
                            hardware, cloud offerings (such as Office 365), LinkedIn, and professional ser-
                            vices remains substantially unchanged. Refer to Impacts to Previously Reported
                            Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard in our consolidated

  1. Based on Exhibit 10, describe whether Microsoft’s results appear better or
     worse under the new revenue recognition standard.
     Solution:
     Microsoft’s results appear better under the new revenue recognition stan-
     dard. Revenues and income are higher under the new standard. The net
     profit margin is higher under the new standard. For 2017, the net profit
     margin is 26.4 percent (= 25,489/96,571) under the new standard versus
     23.6 percent (= 21,204/89,950) under the old standard. Reported revenue
     grew faster under the new standard. Revenue growth under the new stan-
     dard was 5.9 percent [= (96,571/91,154) – 1] compared with 5.4 percent [=
     (89,950/85,320) – 1)] under the old standard.
     Microsoft’s presentation of the effects of the new revenue recognition
     enables an analyst to identify the impact of the change in accounting
     standards.

    Note that the new revenue recognition standard also offered companies the option
of using a “modified retrospective” method of adoption. Under the modified retrospec-
tive approach, companies were not required to revise previously reported financial
statements. Instead, they adjusted opening balances of retained earnings (and other
applicable accounts) for the cumulative impact of the new standard.
    In contrast to changes in accounting policies (such as whether to expense the cost
of employee stock options), companies sometimes make changes in accounting esti-
mates (such as the useful life of a depreciable asset). Changes in accounting estimates
are handled prospectively, with the change affecting the financial statements for the
period of change and future periods. No adjustments are made to prior statements,
and the adjustment is not shown on the face of the income statement. Significant
changes should be disclosed in the notes. Exhibit 11 provides an excerpt from the
annual Form 10-K of Catalent Inc., a US-based biotechnology company, that illustrates
a change in accounting estimate.

Exhibit 11: Change in Accounting Estimate—Excerpt from Catalent Form 10-K

  Catalent Inc. discloses a change in the method it uses to calculate both annual
  expenses related to its defined benefit pension plans. Rather than use a single,
  weighted-average discount rate in its calculations, the company will use the spot
  rates applicable to each projected cash flow.
68   Learning Module 2                                                               Analyzing Income Statements



                            Post-Retirement and Pension Plans
                            The measurement of the related benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit
                            costs recorded each year are based upon actuarial computations, which require
                            management’s judgment as to certain assumptions. These assumptions include
                            the discount rates used in computing the present value of the benefit obligations
                            and the net periodic benefit costs...
                                Effective June 30, 2016, the approach used to estimate the service and inter-
                            est components of net periodic benefit cost for benefit plans was changed to
                            provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs. Historically,
                            the Company estimated these service and interest components utilizing a single
                            weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the
                            benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Going forward, the Company has
                            elected to utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows
                            using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve over the projected
                            cash flow period. The Company has accounted for this change as a change in
                            accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle
                            and accordingly has accounted for it prospectively.

                             Another possible adjustment is a correction of an error for a prior period (e.g.,
                         in financial statements issued for an earlier year). This cannot be handled by simply
                         adjusting the current period income statement. Correction of an error for a prior
                         period is handled by restating the financial statements (including the balance sheet,
                         statement of owners’ equity, and cash flow statement) for the prior periods presented
                         in the current financial statements. Note that disclosures are required regarding the
                         error. These disclosures should be examined carefully because they may reveal weak-
                         nesses in the company’s accounting systems and financial controls.


                         Changes in Scope and Exchange Rates
                         When an issuer acquires a controlling interest in another company, it consolidates its
                         financial statements as of the closing date. Depending on the size of the target relative
                         to the acquirer, an acquisition can materially affect the comparability of the acquirer’s
                         financial results and position from prior periods. Additionally, changes in exchange
                         rates often affect multinational companies’ income statements (e.g., a strengthening
                         functional currency against the reporting currency increases reported revenues, while
                         a declining functional currency against the reporting currency decreases reported
                         revenues). Unfortunately, accounting standards do not require issuers to disclose
                         the effects of either scope or exchange rate changes on the financial statements or in
                         individual items, although most issuers disclose useful summary information (such
                         as revenue and EPS growth rates excluding scope and exchange rate changes) in
                         management reporting or elsewhere.
                             The financial statement implications of changes in scope and exchange rates will
                         be discussed in detail later in the curriculum.

              interpret a company’s basic and diluted earnings per share for
              companies with simple and complex capital structures including
              those with antidilutive securities

One income statement metric of particular importance to equity investors is earnings
per share (EPS). IFRS require the presentation of EPS on the face of the income state-
ment for net profit or loss (net income) and profit or loss (income) from continuing
operations and similar presentation is required under US GAAP. This lesson outlines
the calculations for EPS and explains how the calculation differs for a simple versus
complex capital structure.


Simple versus Complex Capital Structure
A company’s capital is composed of its equity and debt. Some types of equity have
preference over others, and some debt (and other instruments) may be converted
into equity. Under IFRS, the type of equity for which EPS is presented is referred to
as ordinary. Ordinary shares are those equity shares that are subordinate to all other
types of equity. The ordinary shareholders are basically the owners of the company—the
equity holders who are paid last in a liquidation of the company and who benefit the
most when the company does well. Under US GAAP, this ordinary equity is referred
to as common stock or common shares, reflecting US language usage. The terms
“ordinary shares,” “common stock,” and “common shares” are used interchangeably
in the following discussion.
    When a company has issued any financial instruments that are potentially con-
vertible into common stock, it is said to have a complex capital structure. Examples
of financial instruments that are potentially convertible into common stock include
convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, employee stock options, and warrants
(a warrant is essentially an equity call option issued by the company; a warrant holder
has the right but not the obligation to purchase newly issued shares at the exercise
price). If a company’s capital structure does not include such potentially convertible
financial instruments, it is said to have a simple capital structure.
    The distinction between simple versus complex capital structure is relevant to
the calculation of EPS because financial instruments that are potentially convertible
into common stock could, as a result of conversion or exercise, potentially dilute (i.e.,
decrease) EPS. Information about such a potential dilution is valuable to a company’s
current and potential shareholders; therefore, accounting standards require companies
to disclose what their EPS would be if all dilutive financial instruments were converted
into common stock. The EPS that would result if all dilutive financial instruments
were converted is called diluted EPS. In contrast, basic EPS is calculated using the
reported earnings available to common shareholders of the parent company and the
weighted average number of shares outstanding.
    Companies are required to report both basic and diluted EPS as well as amounts for
continuing operations. Exhibit 12 shows the per share amounts reported by AB InBev
at the bottom of its income statement. The company’s basic EPS (“before dilution”)
was USD4.06, and diluted EPS (“after dilution”) was USD3.98 for 2017. In addition,
in the same way that AB InBev’s income statement shows income from continuing
operations separately from total income, EPS from continuing operations is also
shown separately from total EPS. For 2017, the basic and diluted EPS from continuing
operations were USD4.04 and USD3.96, respectively. Across all measures, AB InBev’s

                         EPS was much higher in 2017 than in 2016. An analyst would seek to understand the
                         causes underlying the changes in EPS, a topic we will address following an explanation
                         of the calculations of both basic and diluted EPS.

                         Basic EPS
                         Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the
                         weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period. The amount
                         of income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining
                         after preferred dividends (if any) have been paid. Thus, the formula to calculate basic
                         EPS is as follows:
                                                    Net income − Preferred dividends
                            	​Basic EPS = __________________________________
                                             
                                               
                                          ​Weighted average number of shares outstanding ​.

                         The weighted average number of shares outstanding is a time weighting of common
                         shares outstanding. For example, assume a company began the year with 2,000,000
                         common shares outstanding and repurchased 100,000 common shares on 1 July.
                         The weighted average number of common shares outstanding would be the sum of
                         2,000,000 shares × 1/2 year + 1,900,000 shares × 1/2 year, or 1,950,000 shares. So,
                         the company would use 1,950,000 shares as the weighted average number of shares
                         in calculating its basic EPS.
                             If the number of shares of common stock increases as a result of a stock dividend
                         or a stock split, the EPS calculation reflects the change retroactively to the beginning
                         of the period.
                             Example 8, 9, and 10 illustrate the computation of basic EPS.

                            1. For the year ended 31 December 2018, Shopalot Company had net income
                               of USD1,950,000. The company had 1,500,000 shares of common stock
                               outstanding, no preferred stock, and no convertible financial instruments.
                               What is Shopalot’s basic EPS?
                               Solution:
                               Shopalot’s basic EPS is USD1.30 (USD1,950,000 divided by 1,500,000
                               shares).

  1. What is the company’s weighted average number of shares outstanding?
     Solution:
     The weighted average number of shares outstanding is determined by the
     length of time each quantity of shares was outstanding:
                                              ​




         1,000,000 × (3 months/12 months) =                        250,000
         1,200,000 × (6 months/12 months) =                        600,000
         1,100,000 × (3 months/12 months) =                        275,000
         Weighted average number of shares outstanding            1,125,000
                                              ​




  2. What is the company’s basic EPS?
     Solution:
     Basic EPS = (Net income – Preferred dividends)/Weighted average number
     of shares = (USD2,500,000 – USD200,000)/1,125,000 = USD2.04

  A Basic EPS Calculation (3)

  1. Assume the same facts as Example 7 except that on 1 December 2018, a pre-
     viously declared 2-for-1 stock split took effect. Each shareholder of record
     receives two shares in exchange for each current share that he or she owns.
     What is the company’s basic EPS?
     Solution:
     For EPS calculation purposes, a stock split is treated as if it occurred
     at the beginning of the period. The weighted average number of shares
     would, therefore, be 2,250,000, and the basic EPS would be USD1.02 [=
     (USD2,500,000 – USD200,000)/2,250,000].

                         Diluted EPS: The If-Converted Method
                         If a company has a simple capital structure (in other words, one that includes no
                         potentially dilutive financial instruments), then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted
                         EPS. If, however, a company has potentially dilutive financial instruments, its diluted
                         EPS may differ from its basic EPS. Diluted EPS, by definition, is always equal to or less
                         than basic EPS. The following sections describe the effects of three types of potentially
                         dilutive financial instruments on diluted EPS: convertible preferred, convertible debt,
                         and employee stock options. The final section explains why not all potentially dilutive
                         financial instruments actually result in a difference between basic and diluted EPS.


                         Diluted EPS When a Company Has Convertible Preferred Stock
                         Outstanding
                         When a company has convertible preferred stock outstanding, diluted EPS is cal-
                         culated using the if-converted method. The if-converted method is based on what
                         EPS would have been if the convertible preferred securities had been converted at
                         the beginning of the period. In other words, the method calculates what the effect
                         would have been if the convertible preferred shares converted at the beginning of
                         the period. If the convertible shares had been converted, there would be two effects.
                         First, the convertible preferred securities would no longer be outstanding; instead,
                         additional common stock would be outstanding. Thus, under the if-converted method,
                         the weighted average number of shares outstanding would be higher than in the basic
                         EPS calculation. Second, if such a conversion had taken place, the company would not
                         have paid preferred dividends. Thus, under the if-converted method, the net income
                         available to common shareholders would be higher than in the basic EPS calculation.
                             Diluted EPS using the if-converted method for convertible preferred stock is equal
                         to net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding from
                         the basic EPS calculation plus the additional shares of common stock that would be
                         issued upon conversion of the preferred. Thus, the formula to calculate diluted EPS
                         using the if-converted method for preferred stock is as follows:
                                                       ​(Net income)​

     shares of the company’s common stock. Calculate the company’s basic and
     diluted EPS.
     Solution:
     If the 20,000 shares of convertible preferred had each converted into five
     shares of the company’s common stock, the company would have had an
     additional 100,000 shares of common stock (five shares of common for each
     of the 20,000 shares of preferred). If the conversion had taken place, the
     company would not have paid preferred dividends of USD200,000 (USD10
     per share for each of the 20,000 shares of preferred). As shown in Exhibit 14,
     the company’s basic EPS was USD3.10 and its diluted EPS was USD2.92.

Diluted EPS When a Company Has Convertible Debt
Outstanding
When a company has convertible debt outstanding, the diluted EPS calculation also
uses the if-converted method. Diluted EPS is calculated as if the convertible debt
had been converted at the beginning of the period. If the convertible debt had been
converted, the debt securities would no longer be outstanding; instead, additional
shares of common stock would be outstanding. Also, if such a conversion had taken
place, the company would not have paid interest on the convertible debt, so the net
income available to common shareholders would increase by the after-tax amount of
interest expense on the debt converted.
    Thus, the formula to calculate diluted EPS using the if-converted method for
convertible debt is as follows:
                     (Net income + After-tax interest on convertible debt − Preferred dividends)
   	​Diluted EPS = _____________________________________________________

                           for Convertible Debt

                           1. Oppnox Company (fictitious) reported net income of USD750,000 for the
                              year ended 31 December 2018. The company had a weighted average of
                              690,000 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, the company has
                              only one potentially dilutive security: USD50,000 of 6 percent convertible
                              bonds, convertible into a total of 10,000 shares. Assuming a tax rate of 30
                              percent, calculate Oppnox’s basic and diluted EPS.
                              Solution:
                              If the debt securities had been converted, the debt securities would no
                              longer be outstanding and instead, an additional 10,000 shares of common
                              stock would be outstanding. Also, if the debt securities had been convert-
                              ed, the company would not have paid interest of USD3,000 on the debt,
                              so net income available to common shareholders would have increased by
                              USD2,100 [= USD3,000(1 – 0.30)] on an after-tax basis. Exhibit 15 illustrates
                              the calculation of diluted EPS using the if-converted method for convertible

                         Diluted EPS: The Treasury Stock Method
                         When a company has stock options, warrants, or their equivalents outstanding, diluted
                         EPS is calculated as if the financial instruments had been exercised and the company
                         had used the proceeds from exercise to repurchase as many shares of common stock
                         as possible at the average market price of common stock during the period. The
                         weighted average number of shares outstanding for diluted EPS is thus increased by
                         the number of shares that would be issued upon exercise minus the number of shares
                         that would have been purchased with the proceeds. This method is called the treasury
                         stock method under US GAAP because companies typically hold repurchased shares
                         as treasury stock. The same method is used under IFRS but is not named.
Earnings per Share                                                                        75


    For the calculation of diluted EPS using this method, the assumed exercise of these
financial instruments would have the following effects:
   ■    The company is assumed to receive cash upon exercise and, in exchange, to
        issue shares.
   ■    The company is assumed to use the cash proceeds to repurchase shares at
        the weighted average market price during the period.
    As a result of these two effects, the number of shares outstanding would increase
by the incremental number of shares issued (the difference between the number of
shares issued to the holders and the number of shares assumed to be repurchased
by the company). For calculating diluted EPS, the incremental number of shares is
weighted based upon the length of time the financial instrument was outstanding
in the year. If the financial instrument was issued before the beginning of the year,
the weighted average number of shares outstanding increases by the incremental
number of shares. If the financial instruments were issued during the year, then the
incremental shares are weighted by the amount of time the financial instruments were
outstanding during the year.
    The assumed exercise of these financial instruments would not affect net income.
For calculating EPS, therefore, no change is made to the numerator. The formula to
calculate diluted EPS using the treasury stock method (same method as used under
IFRS but not named) for options is as follows:
                         (Net income - Preferred dividends)

A diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method for options is provided
in Example 13.

EXAMPLE 13

  A Diluted EPS Calculation Using the Treasury Stock
  Method for Options

  1. Hihotech Company (fictitious) reported net income of USD2.3 million for
     the year ended 30 June 2018 and had a weighted average of 800,000 com-
     mon shares outstanding. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the company
     has outstanding 30,000 options with an exercise price of USD35. No other
     potentially dilutive financial instruments are outstanding. Over the fiscal
     year, the company’s market price has averaged USD55 per share. Calculate
     the company’s basic and diluted EPS.
       Solution:
       Using the treasury stock method, we first calculate that the company would
       have received USD1,050,000 (USD35 for each of the 30,000 options exer-
       cised) if all the options had been exercised. The options would no longer be
       outstanding; instead, 30,000 shares of common stock would be outstanding.
       Under the treasury stock method, we assume that shares would be repur-
       chased with the cash received upon exercise of the options. At an average
       market price of USD55 per share, the USD1,050,000 proceeds from option
       exercise, the company could have repurchased 19,091 shares. Therefore, the

                               incremental number of shares issued is 10,909 (calculated as 30,000 minus
                               19,091). For the diluted EPS calculation, no change is made to the numera-
                               tor. As shown in Exhibit 16, the company’s basic EPS was USD2.88 and the
                               diluted EPS was USD2.84.

                             As noted, IFRS require a similar computation but does not refer to it as the “treasury
                         stock method.” The company is required to consider that any assumed proceeds are
                         received from the issuance of new shares at the average market price for the period.
                         These new “inferred” shares would be disregarded in the computation of diluted
                         EPS, but the excess of the new shares that would be issued under options contracts
                         minus the new inferred shares would be added to the weighted average number of
                         shares outstanding. The results are the same as the treasury stock method, as shown
                         in Example 14.

                         EXAMPLE 14

                            1. Assuming the same facts given in Example 13, calculate the weighted aver-
                               age number of shares outstanding for diluted EPS under IFRS.
                               Solution:
                               If the options had been exercised, the company would have received
                               USD1,050,000. If this amount had been received from the issuance of new
                               shares at the average market price of USD55 per share, the company would
                               have issued 19,091 shares. IFRS refer to the 19,091 shares the company
                               would have issued at market prices as the inferred shares. The number of
                               shares issued under options (30,000) minus the number of inferred shares
                               (19,091) equals 10,909. This amount is added to the weighted average
                               number of shares outstanding of 800,000 to get diluted shares of 810,909.
                               Note that this is the same result as that obtained under US GAAP; it is just
                               derived in a different manner.

Other Issues with Diluted EPS and Changes in EPS
It is possible that some potentially convertible securities could be antidilutive (i.e.,
their inclusion in the computation would result in an EPS higher than the company’s
basic EPS). Under IFRS and US GAAP, antidilutive securities are not included in the
calculation of diluted EPS. Diluted EPS should reflect the maximum potential dilution
from conversion or exercise of potentially dilutive financial instruments. Diluted EPS
will always be less than or equal to basic EPS. Example 15 provides an illustration of
an antidilutive security.

EXAMPLE 15

  An Antidilutive Security

  1. For the year ended 31 December 2018, Dim-Cool Utility Company (ficti-
     tious) had net income of USD1,750,000. The company had an average of
     500,000 shares of common stock outstanding, 20,000 shares of convertible
     preferred, and no other potentially dilutive securities. Each share of pre-
     ferred pays a dividend of USD10 per share, and each is convertible into three
     shares of the company’s common stock. What was the company’s basic and
     diluted EPS?
     Solution:
     If the 20,000 shares of convertible preferred had each converted into three
     shares of the company’s common stock, the company would have had an
     additional 60,000 shares of common stock (three shares of common for each
     of the 20,000 shares of preferred). If the conversion had taken place, the
     company would not have paid preferred dividends of USD200,000 (USD10
     per share for each of the 20,000 shares of preferred). The effect of using the
     if-converted method would be EPS of USD3.13, as shown in Exhibit 17. Be-
     cause this is greater than the company’s basic EPS of USD3.10, the securities
     are said to be antidilutive and the effect of their conversion would not be
     included in diluted EPS. Diluted EPS would be the same as basic EPS (i.e.,
     USD3.10).

                         Changes in EPS
                         Having explained the calculations of both basic and diluted EPS, we return to an
                         examination of changes in EPS. As noted in Exhibit 12, AB InBev’s fully diluted EPS
                         from continuing operations increased from USD0.68 in 2016 to USD3.96 in 2017. In
                         general, an increase in EPS results from an increase in net income, a decrease in the
                         number of shares outstanding, or a combination of both. In the notes to its financial
                         statements (not shown), AB InBev discloses that the weighted average number of
                         shares for both the basic and fully diluted calculations was greater in 2017 than in
                         2016. Thus, for AB InBev, the improvement in EPS from 2016 to 2017 was driven by
                         an increase in net income. Changes in the numerator and denominator explain the
                         changes in EPS arithmetically. To understand the business drivers of those changes
                         requires further research. Lesson 5 presents analytical tools that an analyst can use
                         to highlight areas for further examination.




             6           INCOME STATEMENT RATIOS AND COMMON-SIZE
                         ANALYSIS

                                      evaluate a company’s financial performance using common-size
                                      income statements and financial ratios based on the income
                                      statement

                         In this lesson, we apply two analytical tools to analyze the income statement:
                         common-size analysis and income statement ratios. The objective of this analysis
                         is to assess over a period of time a company’s performance relative to its own past
                         performance or to that of another company.


                         Common-Size Analysis of the Income Statement
                         Common-size analysis of the income statement can be performed by stating each line
                         item on the income statement as a percentage of revenue. Common-size statements
                         facilitate comparison across time periods (time series analysis) and across companies
                         (cross-sectional analysis) because the standardization of each line item removes the
                         effect of size.
Income Statement Ratios and Common-Size Analysis                                             79


     To illustrate, Panel A of Exhibit 18 presents an income statement for three hypo-
thetical companies in the same industry. Company A and Company B, each with USD10
million in sales, are larger (as measured by sales) than Company C, which has only
USD2 million in sales. In addition, Companies A and B both have higher operating
profit: USD2 million and USD1.5 million, respectively, compared with Company C’s
operating profit of only USD400,000.
     How can an analyst meaningfully compare the performance of these companies?
By preparing a common-size income statement, as illustrated in Panel B, an analyst
can readily see that the percentages of Company C’s expenses and profit relative to
its sales are exactly the same as for Company A. Furthermore, although Company C’s
operating profit is lower than Company B’s in absolute dollars, it is higher in percentage
terms (20 percent for Company C compared with only 15 percent for Company B).
For each USD100 of sales, Company C generates USD5 more operating profit than
Company B. In other words, Company C is relatively more profitable than Company
B based on this measure.
     The common-size income statement also highlights differences in companies’
strategies. Comparing the two larger companies, Company A reports significantly
higher gross profit as a percentage of sales than does Company B (70 percent com-
pared with 25 percent). Given that both companies operate in the same industry, why
can Company A generate so much higher gross profit? One possible explanation is
found by comparing the operating expenses of the two companies. Company A spends
significantly more on research and development and on advertising than Company
B. Expenditures on research and development likely result in products with superior
technology. Expenditures on advertising likely result in greater brand awareness. So,
based on these differences, it is likely that Company A is selling technologically supe-
rior products with a better brand image. Company B may be selling its products more
cheaply (with a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales) but is saving money by not
investing in research and development or advertising. In practice, differences across
companies are more subtle, but the concept is similar. An analyst, noting significant
differences, would do more research and seek to understand the underlying reasons
for the differences and their implications for the future performance of the companies.

                                     Note: Each line item is expressed as a percentage of the company’s sales.

                                     For most expenses, comparison to the amount of sales is appropriate. In the case of
                                     taxes, however, it is more meaningful to compare the amount of taxes with the amount
                                     of pretax income. Using note disclosure, an analyst can then examine the causes for
                                     differences in effective tax rates. To project the companies’ future net income, an
                                     analyst would project the companies’ pretax income and apply an estimated effective
                                     tax rate determined in part by the historical tax rates.
                                         Vertical common-size analysis of the income statement is particularly useful in
                                     cross-sectional analysis—comparing companies with each other for a particular time
                                     period or comparing a company with industry or sector data. The analyst could select
                                     individual peer companies for comparison, use industry data from published sources,
                                     or compile data from databases based on a selection of peer companies or broader
                                     industry data. For example, Exhibit 19 presents median common-size income state-
                                     ment data compiled for the components of the S&P 500 classified into the 10 S&P/

                                     that when compiling aggregate data such as this, some level of aggregation is neces-
                                     sary and less detail may be available than from peer company financial statements.
                                     The performance of an individual company can be compared with industry or peer
                                     company data to evaluate its relative performance.

Income Statement Ratios
One aspect of financial performance is profitability. One indicator of profitability is net
profit margin, also known as profit margin and return on sales, which is calculated
as net income divided by revenue (or sales):
                            Net income
   	​Net profit margin = _
                         ​ Revenue ​.​

Net profit margin measures the amount of income that a company was able to gen-
erate for each dollar of revenue. A higher level of net profit margin indicates higher
profitability and is thus more desirable. Net profit margin can also be found directly
on the common-size income statements.
    For AB InBev, net profit margin based on continuing operations for 2017 was 16.2
percent (calculated as profit from continuing operations of USD9,155 million, divided
by revenue of USD56,444 million). To judge this ratio, some comparison is needed.
AB InBev’s profitability can be compared with that of another company or with its
own previous performance. Compared with previous years, AB InBev’s profitability
is higher than in 2016 but lower than 2015. In 2016, net profit margin based on con-
tinuing operations was 6.0 percent, and in 2015, it was 22.9 percent.
    Another measure of profitability is the gross profit margin. Gross profit (gross
margin) is calculated as revenue minus cost of goods sold, and the gross profit margin
is calculated as the gross profit divided by revenue:
                              Gross profit
   	​Gross profit margin = _
                           ​ Revenue ​.

The gross profit margin measures the amount of gross profit that a company has gen-
erated for each dollar of revenue. A higher level of gross profit margin indicates higher
profitability and thus is generally more desirable, although differences in gross profit
margins across companies reflect differences in companies’ strategies. For example,
consider a company pursuing a strategy of selling a differentiated product (e.g., a
product differentiated based on brand name, quality, superior technology, or patent
protection). The company would likely be able to sell the differentiated product at a
higher price than a similar, but undifferentiated, product and, therefore, would likely
show a higher gross profit margin than a company selling an undifferentiated product.
Although a company selling a differentiated product would likely show a higher gross

                                      profit margin, this may take time. In the initial stage of the strategy, the company would
                                      likely incur costs to create a differentiated product, such as advertising or research
                                      and development, which would not be reflected in the gross margin calculation.
                                          AB InBev’s gross profit was USD35,058 million in 2017, USD27,715 million in 2016,
                                      and USD26,467 million in 2015. Expressing gross profit as a percentage of revenues,
                                      we see that the gross profit margin was 62.1 percent in 2017, 60.9 percent in 2016, and
                                      60.7 percent in 2015. In absolute terms, AB InBev’s gross profit was higher in 2016
                                      than in 2015. However, AB InBev’s gross profit margin was approximately constant
                                      between 2015 and 2016.
                                          Exhibit 20 presents a common-size income statement for AB InBev and highlights
                                      certain profitability ratios. The net profit margin and gross profit margin described
                                      previously are just two of the many subtotals that can be generated from common-size
                                      income statements. Other “margins” used by analysts include the operating profit
                                      margin (profit from operations divided by revenue) and the pretax margin (profit
                                      before tax divided by revenue).

                                      The profitability ratios and the common-size income statement yield quick insights
                                      about changes in a company’s performance. For example, AB InBev’s decrease in
                                      profitability in 2016 was not driven by a decrease in gross profit margin. Gross profit
                                      margin in 2016 was actually slightly higher than in 2015. The company’s decrease in
                                      profitability in 2016 was driven in part by higher operating expenses and, in particular,
                                      by a significant increase in finance costs. The increased finance costs resulted from
                                      the 2016 merger with SABMiller. Valued at more than USD100 billion, the acquisition

was one of the largest in history. The combination of AB InBev and SABMiller also
explains the increase in revenue from around USD45 billion to over USD56 billion.
The profitability ratios and the common-size income statement thus highlight areas
about which an analyst might wish to gain further understanding.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                         1. Under IFRS, income includes increases in economic benefits from:
                            A. increases in liabilities not related to owners’ contributions.

                            B. enhancements of assets not related to owners’ contributions.

                            C. increases in owners’ equity related to owners’ contributions.

                         2. Fairplay reported the information shown in Exhibit 1 related to the sale of its
                            products during 2009, which was its first year of business:

                            Under the accrual basis of accounting, how much net revenue would be reported
                            on Fairplay’s 2009 income statement?
                            A. USD200,000

                         3. Apex Consignment sells items over the internet for individuals on a consignment
                            basis. Apex receives the items from the owner, lists them for sale on the internet,
                            and receives a 25 percent commission for any items sold. Apex collects the full
                            amount from the buyer and pays the net amount after commission to the owner.
                            Unsold items are returned to the owner after 90 days. During 2009, Apex had the
                            following information:
                             ■   Total sales price of items sold during 2009 on consignment was
                                 EUR2,000,000.
                             ■   Total commissions retained by Apex during 2009 for these items was
                                 EUR500,000.
                            How much revenue should Apex report on its 2009 income statement?
                            A. EUR500,000

                            B. EUR2,000,000

                         12. Cell Services Inc. (CSI) had 1,000,000 average shares outstanding during all of
                             2009. During 2009, CSI also had 10,000 options outstanding with exercise prices
                             of USD10 each. The average stock price of CSI during 2009 was USD15. For pur-
                             poses of computing diluted earnings per share, how many shares would be used
                             in the denominator?

                            SOLUTIONS
                         1. B is correct. Under IFRS, income includes increases in economic benefits from
                            increases in assets, enhancement of assets, and decreases in liabilities.

                         2. B is correct. Net revenue is revenue for goods sold during the period less any
                            returns and allowances, or USD1,000,000 minus USD100,000 = USD900,000.

                         3. A is correct. Apex is not the owner of the goods and should only report its net
                            commission as revenue.

                         4. C is correct. Under the converged accounting standards, the incremental costs
                            of obtaining a contract and certain costs incurred to fulfill a contract must be
                            capitalized. If a company expensed these incremental costs in the years prior to
                            adopting the converged standards, all else being equal, its profitability will appear
                            higher under the converged standards.

                         5. A is correct. A fire may be infrequent, but it would still be part of continuing op-
                            erations and reported in the profit and loss statement. Discontinued operations
                            relate to a decision to dispose of an operating division.

                         6. C is correct. If a company changes an accounting policy, the financial statements
                            for all fiscal years shown in a company’s financial report are presented, if prac-
                            tical, as if the newly adopted accounting policy had been used throughout the
                            entire period; this retrospective application of the change makes the financial re-
                            sults of any prior years included in the report comparable. Notes to the financial
                            statements describe the change and explain the justification for the change.

                         7. C is correct. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for 2009 is
                            1,050,000. Basic earnings per share would be USD1,000,000 divided by 1,050,000,
                            or USD0.95.

                         8. A is correct. Basic and diluted EPS are equal for a company with a simple capital
                            structure. A company that issues only common stock, with no financial instru-
                            ments that are potentially convertible into common stock has a simple capital
                            structure. Basic EPS is calculated using the weighted average number of shares
                            outstanding.

                         9. C is correct.
                            Diluted EPS
                            = (Net income)/(Weighted average number of shares outstanding + New common
                            shares that would have been issued at conversion)

                            = USD200,000,000/[50,000,000 + (2,000,000 × 2)]

                            = USD3.70
                            The diluted EPS assumes that the preferred dividend is not paid and that the
                            shares are converted at the beginning of the period.

                         10. B is correct. The formula to calculate diluted EPS is as follows:
Solutions                                                                                   89


   Diluted EPS
   = (Net income – Preferred dividends)/[Weighted average number of shares out-
   standing + (New shares that would have been issued at option exercise – Shares
   that could have been purchased with cash received upon exercise) × (Proportion of
   year during which the financial instruments were outstanding)].
   The underlying assumption is that outstanding options are exercised, and then
   the proceeds from the issuance of new shares are used to repurchase shares
   already outstanding:
   Proceeds from option exercise = 100,000 × USD20 = USD2,000,000

   Shares repurchased = USD2,000,000/USD25 = 80,000
   The net increase in shares outstanding is thus 100,000 – 80,000 = 20,000. There-
   fore, the diluted EPS for CWC = (USD12,000,000 – USD800,000)/2,020,000 =
   USD5.54.

11. B is correct. LB has warrants in its capital structure; if the exercise price is less
    than the weighted average market price during the year, the effect of their conver-
    sion is to increase the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
    causing diluted EPS to be lower than basic EPS. If the exercise price is equal to
    the weighted average market price, the number of shares issued equals the num-
    ber of shares repurchased. Therefore, the weighted average number of common
    shares outstanding is not affected and diluted EPS equals basic EPS. If the exer-
    cise price is greater than the weighted average market price, the effect of their
    conversion is anti-dilutive. As such, they are not included in the calculation of ba-
    sic EPS. LB’s basic EPS is USD1.22 [= (USD3,350,000 – USD430,000)/2,400,000].
    Stock dividends are treated as having been issued retroactively to the beginning
    of the period.

12. A is correct. With stock options, the treasury stock method must be used. Under
    that method, the company would receive USD100,000 (10,000 × USD10) and
    would repurchase 6,667 shares (USD100,000/USD15). The shares for the denom-
    inator would be:

            Shares outstanding                            1,000,000
            Options exercises                                10,000
            Treasury shares purchased                        (6,667)
            Denominator                                   1,003,333


13. A is correct. When a company has stock options outstanding, diluted EPS is
    calculated as if the financial instruments had been exercised and the company
    had used the proceeds from the exercise to repurchase as many shares possible
    at the weighted average market price of common stock during the period. As a
    result, the conversion of stock options increases the number of common shares
    outstanding but has no effect on net income available to common shareholders.
    The conversion of convertible debt increases the net income available to common
    shareholders by the after-tax amount of interest expense saved. The conversion
    of convertible preferred shares increases the net income available to common
    shareholders by the amount of preferred dividends paid; the numerator becomes
    the net income.

14. B is correct. Common size income statements facilitate comparison across time
    periods (time-series analysis) and across companies (cross-sectional analysis) by
    stating each line item of the income statement as a percentage of revenue. The
    relative performance of different companies can be more easily assessed because

                         scaling the numbers removes the effect of size. A common size income statement
                         states each line item on the income statement as a percentage of revenue. The
                         standardization of each line item makes a common size income statement useful
                         for identifying differences in companies’ strategies.

                            ■   Intangible assets refer to identifiable non-monetary assets without
                                physical substance. Examples include patents, licenses, and trade-
                                marks. For each intangible asset, a company assesses whether its
                                useful life is finite or indefinite.
                            ■   An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized on a system-
                                atic basis over the best estimate of its useful life, with the amortization
                                method and useful life estimate reviewed at least annually. Intangibles
                                are subject to impairment as well, in a similar manner to tangible
                                assets like property, plant, and equipment.
                            ■   An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized.
                                Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually.
                            ■   For internally generated intangible assets, the International Financial
                                Reporting Standards (IFRS) require that costs incurred during the
                                research phase must be expensed. Costs incurred in the development
                                stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are met,
                                including technological feasibility, the ability to use or sell the result-
                                ing asset, and the ability to complete the project.
                            ■   The most common intangible asset that is not a separately identifiable
                                asset is goodwill, which arises in business combinations. Goodwill is
                                not amortized; instead it is tested for impairment at least annually.
                            ■   Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial
                                asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of
                                another entity. In general, financial instruments are measured in two
                                ways: fair value or amortized cost. For financial instruments measured
                                at fair value, the two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value
                                are recognized are (1) as profit or loss on the income statement, or
                                (2) as other comprehensive income (loss) that bypasses the income
                                statement.
                            ■   Common long-term liabilities include loans (i.e., borrowings from
                                banks), notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to
                                investors), leases, and post-employment liabilities. Liabilities are usu-
                                ally reported at amortized cost or fair value on the balance sheet.
                            ■   Vertical common-size analysis of the balance sheet involves expressing
                                each balance sheet item as a percentage of total assets.
                            ■   Balance sheet ratios include liquidity ratios (measuring the company’s
                                ability to meet its short-term obligations) and solvency ratios (measur-
                                ing the company’s ability to meet long-term and other obligations).

                                   assets
Intangible Assets                                                                           93


Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance.1
An identifiable asset can be acquired on a standalone basis (i.e., can be separated from
the entity) or arises from contractual or legal rights and privileges. Common examples
include patents, licenses, trademarks, and customer lists. The most common intangible
that is not separately identifiable is goodwill, which arises in business combinations
and is discussed further in the next lesson.
     IFRS permits companies to report intangible assets using either a cost model or
a revaluation model. The revaluation model can be selected only when there is an
active market for an intangible asset. Both measurement models are essentially the
same as described for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). US GAAP permits
only the cost model.
     For each intangible asset, a company assesses whether the useful life of the asset
is finite or indefinite. Amortization and impairment principles apply as follows:
    ■   An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized on a systematic basis
        over the best estimate of its useful life, with the amortization method and
        useful life estimate reviewed at least annually.
    ■   Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the
        same as for PP&E.
    ■   An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized. Instead,
        at least annually, the reasonableness of assuming an indefinite useful life for
        the asset is reviewed and the asset is tested for impairment.
    Financial analysts traditionally view reported values of intangible assets - partic-
ularly goodwill - with caution. Consequently, in assessing financial statements, some
analysts exclude the book value assigned to intangibles, reducing net equity by an
equal amount (obtaining a “tangible book value”) and increasing pretax income by
any amortization expense or impairment associated with the intangibles. An arbitrary
assignment of zero value to intangibles is not advisable; instead, an analyst should
examine each listed intangible and assess whether an adjustment should be made.
Note disclosures about intangible assets may provide useful information to the ana-
lyst. These disclosures include information about useful lives, amortization rates and
methods, and impairment losses recognized or reversed.
    Further, a company may have developed intangible assets internally that can be
recognized only in certain circumstances. Companies may also have assets that are
never recorded on a balance sheet because they are non-identifiable and the company
does not have sufficient control over their future economic benefits. These assets might
include management and technical skills of employees, market share, name recogni-
tion, a good reputation among customers, and so forth. Such assets are valuable and
are reflected, in theory, in the price at which the company’s equity securities trade
in the market (and the price at which the entirety of the company’s equity would be
sold in an acquisition transaction). Such assets may be recognized as goodwill by an
acquirer if the company is sold.


Identifiable Intangibles
Under IFRS, identifiable intangible assets are recognized on the balance sheet if it is
probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the cost of the asset
can be measured reliably. Examples of identifiable intangible assets include patents,
trademarks, copyrights, franchises, licenses, and other rights. Identifiable intangible
assets may have been created internally or purchased by a company. Determining the

                         cost of internally created intangible assets can be difficult and subjective. For these
                         reasons, under IFRS and US GAAP, the general requirement is that internally created
                         identifiable intangibles are expensed rather than reported on the balance sheet.
                             IFRS provides that for internally created intangible assets, the company must
                         separately identify its research phase and development phase.2 The research phase
                         includes activities that seek new knowledge or products. The development phase
                         occurs after the research phase and includes design or testing of prototypes and
                         models. IFRS requires that costs to internally generate intangible assets during the
                         research phase must be expensed on the income statement while costs incurred in
                         the development stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are
                         met, including technological feasibility, the ability to use or sell the resulting asset,
                         and the ability to complete the project.
                             US GAAP prohibits the capitalization of most costs of internally developed
                         intangibles and research and development. All such costs are expensed. Costs related
                         to the following categories typically are expensed under IFRS and US GAAP. They
                         include the following:
                             ■   internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, and customer lists;
                             ■   start-up costs;
                             ■   training costs;
                             ■   administrative and other general overhead costs;
                             ■   advertising and promotion;
                             ■   relocation and reorganization expenses; and
                             ■   redundancy and other termination costs.
                             In contrast to internally created intangibles, acquired or purchased intangible
                         assets are capitalized and reported as separately identifiable intangible, so long as
                         they arise from contractual rights (such as a licensing agreement), other legal rights
                         (such as patents), or have the ability to be separated and sold (such as a customer list).

                            Alpha Inc., a motor vehicle manufacturer, has a research division that
                            worked on the following projects during the year:
                              Project 1     Research aimed at finding a steering mechanism that does not
                                            operate like a conventional steering wheel but reacts to the
                                            impulses from a driver’s fingers.
                              Project 2  The design of a prototype welding apparatus that is controlled
                                         electronically rather than mechanically. The apparatus has been
                                         determined to be technologically feasible, salable, and feasible to
                                         produce.
                               The following is a summary of the expenses of the research division (in
                            thousands of euros):

   1. Five percent of administrative personnel costs can be attributed to each
      project (Project 1 and 2). Explain the accounting treatment of Alpha’s costs
      for Projects 1 and 2 under IFRS and US GAAP.
        Solution to 1:
        Under IFRS, the capitalization of internal development costs for Projects 1
        and 2 would be as follows:
                                                     ​




                                                            Amount Capitalized as an Asset
                                                               (in thousands of euros)

    Project 1:      Classified as in the research                            0
                    stage, so all costs are recog-
                    nized as expenses
    Project 2:      Classified as in the develop-               (620 + 320 + 470)= 1,410
                    ment stage, so costs may be
                    capitalized. Note that adminis-
                    trative costs are not capitalized.
                                                     ​




        Under US GAAP, there would no capitalization of these costs as US GAAP
        prohibits the capitalization of most costs of internally developed intangibles
        and research and development. All costs would be expensed.

     Consider the balance sheet information presented in Exhibit 2 and 3 for SAP and
Apple. SAP’s 2017 balance sheet shows EUR2,967 million of intangible assets, and
Apple’s 2017 balance sheet shows acquired intangible assets, net of USD2,298 million.
SAP’s notes to financial statements disclose the types of intangible assets (software and
database licenses, purchased software to be incorporated into its products, customer
contracts, and acquired trademark licenses) and indicates that all of its purchased
intangible assets other than goodwill have finite useful lives and are amortized either
based on expected consumption of economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives, which range from 2 to 20 years. Apple’s notes disclose that
its acquired intangible assets consist primarily of patents and licenses, and almost the
entire amount represents definite-lived and amortizable assets for which the remaining
weighted-average amortization period is 3.4 years as of 2017.

                                                                                             3
                explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to goodwill

When one company acquires another, the purchase price is allocated to all of the
identifiable assets (tangible and intangible) and liabilities acquired, based on fair
value. If the purchase price is greater than the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities acquired, the excess amount is recognized as an asset, goodwill. To under-
stand why an acquirer would pay more to purchase a company than the fair value of
the target company’s identifiable assets net of liabilities, consider the following three
observations. First, certain items not recognized in the acquiree’s financial statements
(e.g., its reputation, established distribution system, trained employees) have value.
Second, a target company’s expenditures in research and development may not have
resulted in a separately identifiable asset that meets the criteria for recognition but
nonetheless may have created some value. Third, part of the value of an acquisition
may arise from improved strategic positioning versus a competitor or from perceived
synergies such as operating cost saving opportunities after the acquisition.
    The subject of recognizing goodwill in financial statements has both proponents
and opponents. The proponents of goodwill recognition assert that goodwill is the
present value of excess returns that a company is expected to earn. This group claims
that determining the present value of these excess returns is analogous to determin-
ing the present value of future cash flows associated with other assets and projects.
Opponents of goodwill recognition claim that the prices paid for acquisitions often
turn out to be based on unrealistic expectations, thereby leading to future write-offs
of goodwill.
    Analysts should distinguish between accounting goodwill and economic goodwill.
Economic goodwill is based on the economic performance of the entity, whereas
accounting goodwill is based on accounting standards and is reported only in the case
of acquisitions. Economic goodwill is important to analysts and investors, and it is not
necessarily reflected on the balance sheet. Instead, economic goodwill is reflected in
the stock price (at least in theory). Some financial statement users believe that good-
will should not be listed on the balance sheet, because it cannot be sold separately
from the entity. These financial statement users believe that only assets that can be
separately identified and sold should be reflected on the balance sheet. Other financial
statement users analyze goodwill and any subsequent impairment charges to assess
management’s performance on prior acquisitions.
    Under both IFRS and US GAAP, accounting goodwill arising from acquisitions is
capitalized. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually. If good-
will is deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss is charged against income in the
current period, reducing earnings. An impairment loss also reduces total assets, so
some performance measures, such as return on assets (net income divided by average
total assets), may increase in future periods. An impairment loss is a non-cash item.
    Accounting standards’ requirements for recognizing goodwill can be summarized
by the following steps:
     Step 1     The total cost to purchase the target company (the acquiree) is
                determined.
98   Learning Module 3                                                                           Analyzing Balance Sheets


                              Step 2    The acquiree’s identifiable assets are measured at fair value. The
                                        acquiree’s liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair
                                        value. The difference between the fair value of identifiable assets and
                                        the fair value of the liabilities and contingent liabilities equals the net
                                        identifiable assets acquired.

                              Step 3    Goodwill arising from the purchase is the excess of (1) the cost to
                                        purchase the target company over (2) the net identifiable assets
                                        acquired. Occasionally, a transaction will involve the purchase of net
                                        identifiable assets with a value greater than the cost to purchase. Such
                                        a transaction is called a “bargain purchase.” Any gain from a bargain
                                        purchase is recognized in profit and loss in the period in which it
                                        arises.3
                             Companies are also required to disclose information that enables users to evaluate
                         the nature and financial effect of business combinations. The required disclosures
                         include, for example, the acquisition date fair value of the total cost to purchase the
                         target company, the acquisition date amount recognized for each major class of assets
                         and liabilities, and a qualitative description of the factors that make up the goodwill
                         recognized.
                             Despite the guidance incorporated in accounting standards, analysts should be
                         aware that the estimations of fair value involve considerable management judgment.
                         Values for intangible assets, such as computer software, might not be easily validated
                         when analyzing acquisitions. Management judgment about valuation in turn affects
                         current and future financial statements because identifiable intangible assets with
                         definite lives are amortized over time. In contrast, neither goodwill nor identifiable
                         intangible assets with indefinite lives are amortized; instead, as noted, both are tested
                         annually for impairment.
                             The recognition and impairment of goodwill can significantly affect the compara-
                         bility of financial statements between companies. Therefore, analysts often adjust the
                         companies’ financial statements by removing the impact of goodwill. Such adjustments
                         include the following:
                             ■   excluding goodwill from balance sheet data used to compute financial ratios,
                                 and
                             ■   excluding goodwill impairment losses from income data used to examine
                                 operating trends.
                             In addition, analysts can develop expectations about a company’s performance
                         following an acquisition by taking into account the purchase price paid relative to
                         the net assets and earnings prospects of the acquired company.

                         GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

                            Safeway, Inc., is a North American food and drug retailer. On 25

                            lowing information:
                                 ■   Safeway Inc. today reported a net loss of USD1,609.1 million (USD4.06
                                     per diluted share) for the 16-week fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding

            USD209.1 million (USD0.53 per diluted share). Net income was
            USD338.0 million (USD0.79 per diluted share) for the 17-week fourth
            quarter of 2008.
        ■   In the fourth quarter of 2009, Safeway recorded a non-cash goodwill
            impairment charge of USD1,974.2 million (USD1,818.2 million, net of
            tax). The impairment was due primarily to Safeway’s reduced market
            capitalization and a weak economy. . . . The goodwill originated from
            previous acquisitions.
        ■   Safeway’s balance sheet as of 2 January 2010 showed goodwill of
            USD426.6 million and total assets of USD14,963.6 million. The compa-
            ny’s balance sheet as of 3 January 2009 showed goodwill of USD2,390.2
            million and total assets of USD17,484.7 million.


   1. How significant was this goodwill impairment charge?
      Solution:
      The goodwill impairment was more than 80 percent of the total value of
      goodwill and 11 percent of total assets, so it was clearly significant. (The
      charge of USD1,974.2 million equals 82.6 percent of the USD2,390.2 million
      of goodwill at the beginning of the year and 11.3 percent of the USD17,484.7
      million total assets at the beginning of the year.)

   2. With reference to acquisition prices, what might this goodwill impairment
      indicate?
      Solution:
      The goodwill had originated from previous acquisitions. The impairment
      charge implies that the acquired operations are now worth less than the
      price that was paid for their acquisition.

    As presented in Exhibits 2 and 3, SAP’s 2017 balance sheet shows EUR21,274
million of goodwill, and Apple’s 2017 balance sheet shows goodwill of USD5,717
million. Goodwill represents 50.1 percent of SAP’s total assets and only 1.5 percent
of Apple’s total assets. An analyst may be concerned that goodwill represents such a
high proportion of SAP’s total assets.




FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
                                                                                             4
                explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to financial
                instruments

IFRS defines a financial instrument as a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of
one entity, and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.4 This lesson
focuses on financial assets, such as a company’s investments in stocks issued by another
company or its investments in the notes, bonds, or other fixed-income instruments
issued by another company (or issued by a governmental entity). Financial liabilities,
such as notes payable and bonds payable issued by the company, will be discussed
later. Some financial instruments may be classified as either an asset or a liability

                          depending on the contractual terms and current market conditions. One example of
                          such a financial instrument is a derivative. Derivatives are financial instruments for
                          which the value is derived based on some underlying factor (interest rate, exchange
                          rate, commodity price, security price, or credit rating) and for which little or no initial
                          investment is required.
                               Financial instruments are generally recognized when the entity becomes a party
                          to the contractual provisions of the instrument. In general, the two basic alternative
                          ways that financial instruments are measured subsequent to initial acquisition are
                          fair value or amortized cost. Recall that fair value is the price that would be received
                          to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market transaction.5 The
                          amortized cost of a financial asset (or liability) is the amount at which it was initially
                          recognized, minus any principal repayments, plus or minus any amortization of dis-
                          count or premium, and minus any reduction for impairment.
                               Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost if the
                          asset’s cash flows occur on specified dates and consist solely of principal and interest,
                          and if the business model is to hold the asset to maturity. The concept is similar in US
                          GAAP, where this category of asset is referred to as held-to-maturity. An example is
                          an investment in a long-term bond issued by another company or by a government; the
                          value of the bond will fluctuate, for example with interest rate movements, but if the
                          bond is classified as a held-to-maturity investment, it will be measured at amortized
                          cost on the balance sheet of the investing company. Other types of financial assets
                          measured at amortized cost are loans to other companies.
                               For financial instruments measured at fair value, the two basic alternatives in
                          how net changes in fair value are recognized are (1) as profit or loss on the income
                          statement, or (2) as other comprehensive income (loss), which bypasses the income
                          statement. Note that these alternatives refer to unrealized changes in fair value, that
                          is, changes in the value of a financial asset that has not been sold and is still owned
                          at the end of the period. Unrealized gains and losses also are referred to as holding
                          period gains and losses. Realized gains or losses as a result of a sale are reported on
                          the income statement.
                               Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through other
                          comprehensive income (i.e., any unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in
                          other comprehensive income) if the business model’s objective involves both collect-
                          ing contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets. This IFRS category applies
                          specifically to debt investments, namely assets with cash flows occurring on specified
                          dates and consisting solely of principal and interest. However, IFRS also permits equity
                          investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if,
                          at the time a company buys an equity investment, the company decides to make an
                          irrevocable election to measure the asset in this manner.6 The concept is similar to the
                          US GAAP investment category available-for-sale in which assets are measured at fair
                          value, with any unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive
                          income. Unlike IFRS, however, the US GAAP category available-for-sale applies only
                          to debt securities and is not permitted for investments in equity securities.7
                               Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through
                          profit or loss (i.e., any unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in the income
                          statement) if they are not assigned to either of the other two measurement catego-
                          ries described earlier. In addition, IFRS allows a company to make an irrevocable
                          election at acquisition to measure a financial asset in this category. Under US GAAP,
                          all investments in equity securities (other than investments giving rise to ownership

To illustrate the different accounting treatments of the gains and losses on finan-
cial assets, consider an entity that invests EUR100,000,000 on 1 January 202X in
a fixed-income security investment, with a 5 percent coupon paid semi-annually.
After six months, the company receives the first coupon payment of EUR2,500,000.
Additionally, market interest rates have declined such that the value of the fixed-income
investment has increased by EUR2,000,000 as of 30 June 202X. Exhibit 5 illustrates how
this situation will be portrayed on the balance sheet and income statement (ignoring
taxes) of the entity concerned, under each of the following three measurement cat-
egories of financial assets: assets held for trading purposes, assets available for sale,
and held-to-maturity assets.

                                     In the case of securities classified as Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost, or equiv-
                                     alently held-to-maturity (US GAAP), the income statement shows only the interest
                                     income (which is then reflected in retained earnings on the ending balance sheet).
                                     Because the securities are measured at cost rather than at fair value, no unrealized
                                     gain is recognized. On the balance sheet, the investment asset is shown at its amor-
                                     tized cost of EUR100,000,000.
                                         In the case of securities classified as Measured at Fair Value through Other
                                     Comprehensive Income (IFRS), or equivalently as Available-for-Sale debt securities
                                     (US GAAP), the income statement shows only the interest income (which is then
                                     reflected in retained earnings on the ending balance sheet). The unrealized gain
                                     does not appear on the income statement; instead, it would appear on a Statement
                                     of Comprehensive Income as Other Comprehensive Income. On the balance sheet,
                                     the investment asset is shown at its fair value of EUR102,000,000. (Exhibit 5 shows
                                     the unrealized gain on a separate line solely to highlight the impact of the change
                                     in value. In practice, the investments would be shown at their fair value on a single
                                     line.) In the case of securities classified as Measured at Fair Value through Profit and
                                     Loss (IFRS), or equivalently as trading debt securities (US GAAP), both the interest
                                     income and the unrealized gain are included on the income statement and thus are
                                     reflected in retained earnings on the balance sheet.
                                         From the information presented in Exhibits 2 and 6, SAP’s 2017 balance sheet shows
                                     other financial assets of EUR990 million (current, Exhibit 6) and EUR1,155 million
                                     (non-current, Exhibit 2). The company’s notes disclose that the largest component of
                                     the current financial assets are loans and other financial receivables (EUR793 million)
                                     and the largest component of the non-current financial assets is EUR827 million of
                                     available-for-sale equity investments.

In Exhibits 3 and 7, Apple’s 2017 balance sheet shows USD53,892 million of short-term
marketable securities (current, Exhibit 7) and USD194,714 million of long-term mar-
ketable securities (non-current, Exhibit 3). In total, marketable securities represent
more than 66 percent of Apple’s USD375.3 billion in total assets. Marketable secu-
rities plus cash and cash equivalents represent around 72 percent of the company’s
total assets. Apple’s notes disclose that most of the company’s marketable securities
are fixed-income securities issued by the US government or its agencies (USD60,237
million) and by other companies, including commercial paper (USD153,451 million).

                          In accordance with its investment policy, Apple invests in highly rated securities
                          (which the company defines as investment grade) and limits its credit exposure to
                          any one issuer. The company classifies its marketable securities as available for sale
                          and reports them on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are
                          reported in other comprehensive income.




              5           NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES

                                         liabilities

                          All liabilities that are not classified as current are considered to be non-current or
                          long-term. Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9 present balance sheet excerpts for SAP Group and
                          Apple Inc. showing the line items for the companies’ non-current liabilities.
                              Both companies’ balance sheets show non-current unearned revenue (deferred
                          income for SAP Group and deferred revenue for Apple). These amounts represent
                          unearned revenue relating to goods and services expected to be delivered in periods
                          beyond 12 months following the reporting period. The sections that follow focus on
                          two common types of non-current (long-term) liabilities: long-term financial liabilities
                          and deferred tax liabilities.

Long-Term Financial Liabilities
Typical long-term financial liabilities include loans (i.e., borrowings from banks) and
notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to investors). Liabilities
such as loans payable and bonds payable are usually reported at amortized cost on the
balance sheet. At maturity, the amortized cost of the bond (carrying amount) will be
equal to the face value of the bond. For example, if a company issues USD10,000,000
of bonds at par value, the bonds are reported as a long-term liability of USD10 million.
The carrying amount (amortized cost) from the date of issue to the date of maturity
remains at USD10 million. As another example, if a company issues USD10,000,000
of bonds at a price of 97.50 percent of par value (a discount to par), the bonds are
reported as a liability of USD9,750,000 at issue date. Over the bond’s life, the dis-
count of USD250,000 is amortized so that the bond will be reported as a liability of
USD10,000,000 at maturity. Similarly, any bond premium would be amortized for
bonds issued at a price in excess of par value.
    In certain cases, liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are reported at fair
value. Those cases include financial liabilities held for trading, derivatives that are a
liability to the company, and some non-derivative instruments, such as those which
are hedged by derivatives.
    SAP’s balance sheet in Exhibit 8 shows EUR5,034 million in financial liabilities, and
the notes disclose that these liabilities are mostly for bonds payable. Apple’s balance
sheet in Exhibit 9 shows USD97,207 million in long-term debt, and the notes disclose
that this debt includes floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities.

                          Deferred Tax Liabilities
                          Deferred tax liabilities result from temporary timing differences between a compa-
                          ny’s income as reported for tax purposes (taxable income) and income as reported
                          for financial statement purposes (reported income). Deferred tax liabilities result
                          when taxable income, and the actual income tax payable in a period based on it, is
                          less than the reported financial statement income before taxes and the income tax
                          expense based on it. Deferred tax liabilities are defined as the amounts of income taxes
                          payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.8 In contrast, in
                          the previous discussion of unearned revenue, inclusion of revenue in taxable income
                          in an earlier period created a deferred tax asset (essentially prepaid tax).
                              Deferred tax liabilities typically arise when some expenses are included in taxable
                          income in earlier periods than for financial statement net income. This results in
                          taxable income being less than income before taxes in the earlier periods. As a result,
                          taxes payable based on taxable income are less than income tax expense based on
                          accounting income before taxes. The difference between taxes payable and income tax
                          expense results in a deferred tax liability—for example, when companies use accelerated
                          depreciation methods for tax purposes and straight-line depreciation methods for
                          financial statement purposes. Deferred tax liabilities also arise when some income is
                          included in taxable income in later periods—for example, when a company’s subsid-
                          iary has profits that have not yet been distributed and thus have not yet been taxed.
                              SAP’s balance sheet in Exhibit 8 shows EUR240 million of deferred tax liabilities.
                          Apple’s balance sheet in Exhibit 9 does not show a separate line item for deferred tax
                          liabilities; however, note disclosures indicate that most of the USD40,415 million of
                          other non-current liabilities reported on Apple’s balance sheet represents deferred
                          tax liabilities, which totaled USD31,504 million.
                              Non-current liabilities will be explored in greater detail in a later learning module.




              6           RATIOS AND COMMON-SIZE ANALYSIS

                                          calculate and interpret common-size balance sheets and related
                                          financial ratios

                          Analysis of a company’s balance sheet can provide insight into the company’s liquidity
                          and solvency—as of the balance sheet date—as well as the economic resources the
                          company controls. Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to meet its short-term finan-
                          cial commitments. Assessments of liquidity focus on a company’s ability to convert
                          assets to cash to pay for operating needs. Solvency refers to a company’s ability to
                          meet its financial obligations over the longer term. Assessments of solvency focus on
                          the company’s financial structure and its ability to pay long-term financing obligations.
                          This lesson describes two tools for analyzing the balance sheet: common-size analysis
                          and balance sheet ratios.

Common-Size Analysis of the Balance Sheet
The first technique, vertical common-size analysis, involves stating each balance sheet
item as a percentage of total assets.9 Common-size balance sheets are useful in com-
paring a company’s balance sheet composition over time (time-series analysis) and
across companies in the same industry. To illustrate, Panel A of Exhibit 10 presents
balance sheets for three hypothetical companies. Company C, with assets of USD9.75
million is much larger than Company A and Company B, each with only USD3.25
million in assets. The common-size balance sheet presented in Panel B facilitates a
comparison of these different-size companies.

                          Most of the assets of Company A and B are current assets; however, Company A has
                          nearly 60 percent of its total assets in cash and short-term marketable securities,
                          whereas Company B has only 6 percent of its assets in cash. Company A is more liq-
                          uid than Company B. Company A shows no current liabilities (its current liabilities
                          round to less than USD10,000), and it has cash on hand of USD1.0 million to meet
                          any near-term financial obligations it might have. In contrast, Company B has USD2.5
                          million of current liabilities, which exceed its available cash of only USD200,000. To
                          pay those near-term obligations, Company B will need to collect some of its accounts
                          receivables, sell more inventory, borrow from a bank, or raise more long-term capital
                          (e.g., by issuing more bonds or more equity). Company C also appears more liquid than
                          Company B. It holds more than 30 percent of its total assets in cash and short-term
                          marketable securities, and its current liabilities are only 6.2 percent of the amount
                          of total assets.
                              Company C’s USD3.3 million in cash and short-term marketable securities is
                          substantially more than its current liabilities of USD600,000. Turning to the question
                          of solvency, however, note that 98.5 percent of Company C’s assets are financed with
                          liabilities. If Company C experiences significant fluctuations in cash flows, it may be
                          unable to pay the interest and principal on its long-term bonds. Company A is far more
                          solvent than Company C, with less than 1 percent of its assets financed with liabilities.
                              These examples are hypothetical only. Other than general comparisons, little
                          more can be said without further detail. In practice, a wide range of factors affect a
                          company’s liquidity management and capital structure. The study capital structure
                          is a fundamental issue addressed in Corporate Issuers modules.
                              Common-size balance sheets can also highlight differences in companies’ strategies.
                          Comparing the asset composition of the companies, Company C has made a greater
                          proportional investment in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)—possibly because
                          it manufactures more of its products in-house. The presence of goodwill on Company
                          B’s balance sheet signifies that it has made one or more acquisitions in the past. In
                          contrast, the lack of goodwill on the balance sheets of Company A and Company C
                          suggests that these two companies may have pursued a strategy of internal growth
                          rather than growth by acquisition. Company A may be in either a start-up or liquida-
                          tion stage of operations as evidenced by the composition of its balance sheet. It has
                          relatively little inventory and no accounts payable. It either has not yet established trade
                          credit or it is in the process of paying off its obligations in the process of liquidating.

COMMON-SIZE ANALYSIS


   1. Based on the information presented in Exhibits 2, 6, and 8, which
      of the following items increased as a percentage of total assets from 2016 to
      2017? (Note: More than one answer may be correct.)
        A. Total current assets
        B. Total financial liabilities
         C. Cash and cash equivalents
        Solution:
        A and C are correct.
        Total current assets increased from 26.1 percent of total assets in
        2016 (EUR11,564 ÷ EUR44,277) to 28.1 percent in 2017 (EUR11,930 ÷
        EUR42,497).
        Cash and cash equivalents increased from 8.4 percent of total assets in 2016
        (EUR3,702 EUR44,277) to 9.4 percent in 2017 (EUR4,011 ÷ EUR42,497).
        Total financial liabilities decreased in 2017 both in absolute euro amounts
        (EUR5,034) and as a percentage of total assets (EUR5,034 ÷ EUR42,497 =
        11.8%) when compared with 2016 (EUR6,481 ÷ EUR44,277 = 14.6%).
        Overall, aspects of the company’s liquidity position are somewhat stronger
        in 2017 than in 2016. The company’s cash balances as a percentage of total
        assets increased. While current liabilities increased as a percentage of total
        assets and total liabilities remained approximately the same percentage, the
        mix of liabilities shifted. Financial liabilities, which represent future cash
        outlays, decreased as a percentage of total assets.

    Common-size analysis of the balance sheet is particularly useful in cross-sectional
analysis—comparing companies to each other for a particular time period or compar-
ing a company with industry or sector data. The analyst could select individual peer
companies for comparison, use industry data from published sources, or compile data
from databases. When analyzing a company, many analysts prefer to select the peer
companies for comparison or to compile their own industry statistics.
    Exhibit 11 presents common-size balance sheet data compiled for the 10 sectors
of the S&P 500 using 2017 data. The sector classification follows the S&P/MSCI
Global Industrial Classification System (GICS). The exhibit presents mean and median
common-size balance sheet data for those companies in the S&P 500 for which 2017
data was available in the Compustat database.10


Some interesting general observations can be made from
these data:
    ■    Energy and utility companies have the largest amounts of PP&E.
         Telecommunication services, followed by utilities, have the highest level of
         long-term debt. Utilities also use some preferred stock.
    ■    Financial companies have the greatest percentage of total liabilities.
         Financial companies typically have relatively high financial leverage.
    ■    Utility and real estate companies have the lowest level of receivables.

10 An entry of zero for an item (e.g., current assets) was excluded from the data, except in the case of
preferred stock. Note that most financial institutions did not provide current asset or current liability data,
so these are reported as not available in the database.
                                                                                                                                                                      110

  Source: Based on data from companies’ annual reports.
      From these data, Lu learns the following:
      ■   Apple and Microsoft have high levels of cash and short-term mar-
          ketable securities, consistent with the information technology sector
          as reported in Exhibit 11. Apple also has a high balance in long-term
          marketable securities. This may reflect the success of the company’s
          business model, which has generated large operating cash flows in
          recent years.
      ■   Apple’s level of accounts receivable is lower than Microsoft’s and lower
          than the industry average. Further research is necessary to learn the
          extent to which this is related to Apple’s cash sales through its own
          retail stores. An alternative explanation would be that the company
          has been selling or factoring receivables to a greater degree than the
          other companies; however, that explanation is unlikely given Apple’s
          cash position. Additionally, Apple shows vendor non-trade receivables,
          reflecting arrangements with its contract manufacturers.
      ■   Apple and Microsoft both have low levels of inventory, similar to
          industry medians as reported in Exhibit 11. Apple uses contract man-
          ufacturers and can rely on suppliers to hold inventory until needed.
          Additionally, in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of
          their annual report, Apple discloses USD38 billion of noncancelable
          manufacturing purchase obligations, USD33 billion of which is due
          within 12 months. These amounts are not currently recorded as inven-
          tory and reflect the use of contract manufacturers to assemble and
          test some finished products. The use of purchase commitments and
          contract manufacturers implies that inventory may be “understated.”
          Microsoft’s low level of inventory is consistent with its business mix,
          which is more heavily weighted to software than to hardware.
      ■   Apple and Microsoft have a level of PP&E that is relatively close to the
          sector median, as reported in Exhibit 11.
      ■   Apple has a very low amount of goodwill, reflecting its strategy to
          grow organically rather than through acquisition. Microsoft’s level of
          goodwill, while higher than Apple’s, is lower than the industry median
          and mean. Microsoft made a number of major acquisitions (e.g., Nokia
          in 2014), but subsequently (in 2015) it wrote off significant amounts of
          goodwill as an impairment charge.
      ■   Apple’s level of accounts payable is higher than the computer industry
          average, but given the company’s high level of cash and investments, it
          is unlikely that this is a problem.
      ■   Apple’s and Microsoft’s levels of long-term debt are slightly higher
          than industry averages. Again, given the companies’ high level of cash
          and investments, it is unlikely that this is a problem.

                          Balance Sheet Ratios
                          Ratios facilitate time-series and cross-sectional analysis of a company’s financial
                          position. Balance sheet ratios are those involving balance sheet items only. Each of
                          the line items on a vertical common-size balance sheet is a ratio in that it expresses a
                          balance sheet amount in relation to total assets. Other balance sheet ratios compare one
                          balance sheet item to another. For example, the current ratio expresses current assets
                          in relation to current liabilities as an indicator of a company’s liquidity. Balance sheet
                          ratios include liquidity ratios (measuring the company’s ability to meet its short-term
                          obligations) and solvency ratios (measuring the company’s ability to meet long-term
                          and other obligations). These ratios and others are discussed in a later reading. Exhibit
                          13 summarizes the calculation and interpretation of selected balance sheet ratios.

    Cross-sectional financial ratio analysis can be limited by differences in accounting
methods. In addition, lack of homogeneity of a company’s operating activities can
limit comparability. For diversified companies operating in different industries, using
industry-specific ratios for different lines of business can provide better comparisons.
Companies disclose information on operating segments. The financial position and
performance of the operating segments can be compared to the relevant industry.
    Ratio analysis requires a significant amount of judgment. One key area requiring
judgment is understanding the limitations of any ratio. The current ratio, for exam-
ple, is only a rough measure of liquidity at a specific point in time. The ratio cap-
tures only the amount of current assets, but the components of current assets differ
significantly in their nearness to cash (e.g., marketable securities versus inventory).

                          Another limitation of the current ratio is its sensitivity to end-of-period financing
                          and operating decisions that potentially can affect current asset and current liability
                          amounts. Another overall area requiring judgment is determining whether a ratio for
                          a company is within a reasonable range for an industry. Yet another area requiring
                          judgment is evaluating whether a ratio signifies a persistent condition or reflects only
                          a temporary condition. Overall, evaluating specific ratios requires an examination of
                          the entire operations of a company, its competitors, and the external economic and
                          industry setting in which it is operating.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. Goodwill is a long-term asset, and cash and inventories are current
                             assets.

                          2. A is correct. Initially, goodwill is measured as the difference between the pur-
                             chase price paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired, not acquir-
                             ing, company’s net assets (identifiable assets less liabilities).

                          3. B is correct. For financial assets classified as trading securities, unrealized gains
                             and losses are reported on the income statement and flow to shareholders’ equity
                             as part of retained earnings.

                          4. C is correct. For financial assets classified as available for sale, unrealized gains
                             and losses are not recorded on the income statement and instead are part of other
                             comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive income is a compo-
                             nent of shareholders’ equity.

                          5. A is correct. Financial assets classified as held to maturity are measured at amor-
                             tized cost. Gains and losses are recognized only when realized.

                          6. B is correct. Vertical common-size analysis involves stating each balance sheet
                             item as a percentage of total assets. Total assets are the sum of total liabilities
                             (GBP35 million) and total stockholders’ equity (GBP55 million), or GBP90
                             million. Total liabilities are shown on a vertical common-size balance sheet as
                             (GBP35 million ÷ GBP90 million) ≈ 39%.

                          7. B is correct. A common-size balance sheet analysis provides information about
                             the composition of the balance sheet and it changes over time. As a result, it
                             can provide information about an increase or decrease in a company’s financial
                             leverage.

                          8. C is correct. Impairment write-downs reduce equity in the denominator of the
                             debt-to-equity ratio but do not affect debt, so the debt-to-equity ratio is expected
                             to increase. Impairment write-downs reduce total assets but do not affect reve-
                             nue. Thus, total asset turnover is expected to increase.

                          9. A is correct. The current ratio provides a comparison of assets that can be turned
                             into cash relatively quickly and liabilities that must be paid within one year. The
                             other ratios are more suited to evaluate longer-term concerns.

                          10. A is correct. The cash ratio determines how much of a company’s near-term obli-
                              gations can be settled with existing amounts of cash and marketable securities.

                          11. C is correct. The debt-to-equity ratio, a solvency ratio, is an indicator of financial
                              risk.

                          12. C is correct. The presence of goodwill on Company A’s balance sheet signifies
                              that it has made one or more acquisitions in the past. The current, cash, and
                              quick ratios are lower for Company A than for the sector average. These low-
                              er liquidity ratios imply above-average liquidity risk. The total debt, long-term
                              debt-to-equity, debt-to-equity, and financial leverage ratios are lower for Compa-
                              ny B than for the sector average. These lower solvency ratios imply below-average
                              solvency risk.
                             Current ratio is (35 ÷ 35) = 1.00 for Company A, versus (48 ÷ 28)
Solutions                                                                                   121


   = 1.71 for the sector average.

   Cash ratio is (5 + 5) ÷35 = 0.29 for Company A, versus (7 + 2) ÷28
   = 0.32 for the sector average.

   Quick ratio is (5 + 5 + 5) ÷35 = 0.43 for Company A, versus (7 + 2 + 12) ÷28
   = 0.75 for the sector average.

   Total debt ratio is (55 ÷ 100) = 0.55 for Company B, versus (63 ÷ 100)
   = 0.63 for the sector average.

   Long-term debt-to-equity ratio is (20 ÷ 45) = 0.44 for Company B, versus (28 ÷
   37)
   = 0.76 for the sector average.

   Debt-to-equity ratio is (55 ÷ 45) = 1.22 for Company B, versus (63 ÷ 37)
   = 1.70 for the sector average.

   Financial leverage ratio is (100 ÷ 45) = 2.22 for Company B, versus (100 ÷ 37)
   = 2.70 for the sector average.

13. A is correct. The quick ratio is defined as (Cash and cash equivalents + Market-
    able securities + receivables) ÷ Current liabilities. For Company A, this calcula-
    tion is (5 + 5 + 5) ÷ 35 = 0.43.

14. C is correct. The financial leverage ratio is defined as Total assets ÷ Total equity.
    For Company B, total assets are 100 and total equity is 45; hence, the financial
    leverage ratio is 100 ÷ 45 = 2.22.

15. A is correct. A higher cash ratio reflects lower liquidity risk. The cash ratio is
    defined as (Cash + Marketable securities) ÷ Current liabilities. Company A’s cash
    ratio, (5 + 5) ÷ 35 = 0.29, is higher than (5 + 0) ÷ 25 = 0.20 for Company B.

              1           INTRODUCTION
                          The statement of cash flows provides important information about a company’s cash
                          receipts and cash payments during an accounting period, reconciling the cash accounts
                          between balance sheet dates. Although the income statement provides similar measures
                          on an accrual basis, cash flows and their timing are crucial to valuation as payments to
                          investors are made in cash. Investors also use statement of cash flows to evaluate the
                          company’s liquidity, solvency, and financial flexibility. In this module, we discuss the
                          components of the cash flow statement and its links to the other financial statements.

                             LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                                ■   Understanding the interrelationships among the balance sheet,
                                    income statement, and cash flow statement is useful not only
                                    in evaluating the company’s financial health but also in detecting
                                    accounting irregularities.
                                ■   The income statement and statement of cash flows provide key link-
                                    ages between the current assets and current liabilities sections of the
                                    balance sheet.
                                ■   Companies can use either the direct or the indirect method for report-
                                    ing their operating cash flow:
                                ■   The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source (e.g.,
                                    cash received from customers, cash received from investment income)
                                    and operating cash outflows by use (e.g., cash paid to suppliers, cash
                                    paid for interest) in the operating activities section of the cash flow
                                    statement.
                                ■   The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by
                                    adjusting net income for all non-cash items and the net changes in
                                    working capital accounts.
                                ■   Although the indirect method is most common, an analyst may desire
                                    to review direct-format operating cash flow to review trends in cash
                                    receipts and payments, such as cash received from customers or cash
                                    paid to suppliers.
                                ■   Cash flows from operating activities reported under the indirect
                                    method can generally be converted to an approximation of the direct
                                    format by following a simple three-step process.
                                ■   Cash flows from investing activities and from financing activities are
                                    both reported using a direct method, regardless of the method used
                                    for reporting operating cash flows.
                                ■   Compared with US GAAP, the International Financial Reporting
                                    Standards (IFRS) allow more flexibility in the classification of items
                                    as operating, investing, or financing activities, such as interest paid
                                    or received and dividends paid or received and in how income tax
                                    expense is classified.

LINKAGES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                                                                         2
             describe how the cash flow statement is linked to the income
             statement and the balance sheet



Primary Financial Statements
Recall that the four primary financial statements are interrelated and each provides
specific information to analysts about an entity. The primary financial statements are
as follows:
   1. Balance Sheet—shows the financial position of an entity at a point in time,
      reporting the balances of “permanent” or “stock” accounts showing the enti-
      ty’s assets and how those assets are financed.
   2. Income Statement—provides information about a company’s financial per-
      formance between balance sheet dates. The income statement is made up of
      revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts. In contrast to the balance sheet,
      the income statement is a “flow” statement as it captures income activity
      between two balance sheet dates. Income statements prepared under IFRS
      or US GAAP are based on accrual accounting, so they do not necessarily
      reflect cash inflows and outflows.
   3. Statement of Cash Flows—reports the change in an entity’s cash, cash
      equivalents, and restricted cash between balance sheet dates. The statement
      classifies cash inflows and outflows during the period as operating, invest-
      ing, or financing activities. Because the cash flow statement reports perfor-
      mance over a period of time, it is also a “flow” statement, like the income
      statement.
   4. Statement of Shareholder’s Equity—provides information about how a com-
      pany’s equity has changed between balance sheet dates. The statement iden-
      tifies the significant components of shareholders equity that are reported
      on the balance sheet (e.g., common stock and retained earnings) and the
      activities that occurred during the period that impacted these accounts
      (e.g., share issuance, net income or loss). Like the income statement and
      statement of cash flows, the statement of shareholders equity is also a “flow”
      statement.



Relationship between Financial Statements
As illustrated in Exhibit 1, the income statement, cash flow statement and statement
of shareholders’ equity link the balance sheet from one period to the next.

                                                                               Equity

For example, the 20X2 statement of shareholders’ equity reconciles the equity accounts
reported on 20X1 balance sheet to the equity accounts reported on the 20X2 balance
sheet, including additions (or subtractions) resulting from net income or loss reported
on the income statement and dividends paid that are also reported on the statement
of cash flows if made in cash.


Linkages Between Current Assets and Current Liabilities
The income statement and statement of cash flows also provide key linkages between
the current assets and current liabilities sections of the balance sheet. Differences
between the accrual and cash accounting recognition of operating activities result
in an increase or decrease in a current asset or liability on the balance sheet. For
example, accrual basis revenue in excess of cash collections will be accompanied by
an increase in accounts receivable. If expenses reported using accrual accounting are
lower than cash actually paid, the result will typically be a decrease in accounts pay-
able or another accrued liability account. Finally, in situations in which a company is
paid in advance for the delivery of a service or product in the future, it will recognize
the cash received as an asset, but it also must recognize a liability for its obligation to
deliver service or product in the future, typically referred to as deferred revenue. A
deferred revenue liability account is derecognized upon the recognition of revenue
when the entity satisfies its performance obligations.
    If an analyst knows beginning accounts receivable, revenues, and cash collected
from customers, they can compute ending accounts receivable, as the accounts are
linked as shown in Exhibit 4.

                                     Understanding the interrelationships among the balance sheet, income statement, and
                                     cash flow statement is useful not only in evaluating the company’s financial health but
                                     also in detecting accounting irregularities. Recall the extreme illustration of a hypo-
                                     thetical company that makes sales on account without regard to future collections and
                                     thus reports healthy sales and significant income on its income statement yet lacks
                                     cash inflow. Such a pattern would occur if a company improperly recognized revenue.
                                          Example 1–Example 4 demonstrate how common business transactions affect a
                                     company’s balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Notice how
                                     all three financial statements are needed to fully account for the transactions.

                                        1 January 1, 20X1 on credit with payment due to its supplier in 30 days. On 1
                                        February, ABC sells the product to Customer X for USD150 with payment due
                                        by 16 February, 20X1. Customer X pays for the product on 15 February, 20X1.
                                            This series of transaction would affect ABC’s financial statements as follows

EXAMPLE 2

  Depreciation Impact on Financial Statements
  On 1 January, fictional company Notion Ltd, a manufacturing company, owns
  USD100 of equipment used in the production of a product that is sold to whole-
  sale customers. The equipment has a 10-year life and no salvage value. Notion
  uses straight-line depreciation, so the annual depreciation expense is USD10.
  On 1 July, Notion Ltd. makes a new capital investment for a different piece of
  equipment with a purchase price of USD200 and annual depreciation expense of
  USD50. Notion Ltd. pays for the equipment in cash upon receipt. Depreciation
  expense is recorded at the end of the fiscal year. The impact on Notion Ltd.’s
  financial statements is summarized in Exhibit 6.

  Accordingly, Geneva is to pay USD525 to Stockholm Bank on 30 September

THE DIRECT METHOD FOR CASH FLOWS FROM
OPERATING ACTIVITIES                                                                      3
                describe the steps in the preparation of direct and indirect cash flow
                statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income
                statement and balance sheet data

The first step in preparing the cash flow statement is to determine cash flows from
operating activities, which can be presented using the direct or indirect method. The
direct method uses the major categories of gross cash receipts and payments, and the
indirect method reconciles net income to net cash flow. Cash flows from investing
activities and from financing activities are identical regardless of whether the direct
or indirect method is used to present operating cash flows.
    ■   Companies often disclose only indirect operating cash flow information but
        understanding how cash flow information is put together will enable you to
        take an indirect statement apart and reconfigure it to approximate a direct
        cash flow statement, which—while not perfectly accurate—can be useful.
        This lesson demonstrates the approximate preparation of a direct cash flow
        statement using the income statement and the comparative balance sheets
        for Acme Corporation (a fictitious retail company) shown in Exhibit 9 and
        Exhibit 10.

                          Operating Activities: Direct Method
                          We first determine how much cash Acme received from its customers (sometimes
                          referred to as “cash collections”), followed by how much cash was paid to suppliers
                          and to employees, as well as how much cash was paid for other operating expenses,
                          interest, and income taxes.

                          Cash Received From Customers
                          The income statement for Acme reported revenue of USD23,598 for the year ended 31
                          December 2018. To determine the approximate cash receipts from its customers, it is
                          necessary to adjust this revenue amount by the net change in accounts receivable for
                          the year. If accounts receivable increase during the year, revenue on an accrual basis
                          is higher than cash receipts from customers, and vice versa. For Acme Corporation,
                          accounts receivable increased by USD55, so cash received from customers was
                          USD23,543, as shown in Exhibit 11.

Cash received from customers affects the accounts receivable account as shown in
Exhibit 12.

         Beginning accounts receivable                            957

         Ending accounts receivable                             USD1,012

The accounts receivable account information can also be presented as shown in
Exhibit 13.

         Beginning accounts receivable                         USD957

         Minus ending accounts receivable                      (1,012)
         Cash collected from customers                       USD23,543

Acme did not have any deferred or unearned revenue. If it did, further adjustment
would be required to arrive at cash collected from customers (a decrease in deferred
revenue would be a negative adjustment and vice versa).

EXAMPLE 5

   Computing Cash Received from Customers

   1. Blue Bayou, a fictitious advertising company, reported revenues of USD50
      million, total expenses of USD35 million, and net income of USD15 million
      in the most recent year. If accounts receivable decreased by USD12 million,
      how much cash did the company receive from customers?
      A. USD38 million
      B. USD50 million
       C. USD62 million
      Solution:
      C is correct. Revenues of USD50 million plus the decrease in accounts
      receivable of USD12 million equals USD62 million cash received from
      customers. The decrease in accounts receivable means that the company
      received more in cash than the amount of revenue it reported.


Cash Paid to Suppliers
For Acme, the cash paid to suppliers was USD11,900, determined as shown in Exhibit
14.

                                  Equals purchases from suppliers                       USD12,163
                                  Less: Increase in accounts payable                       (263)
                                  Cash paid to suppliers                                USD11,900

                          There are two pieces to this calculation: the amount of inventory purchased and
                          the amount paid for it. To determine purchases from suppliers, cost of goods sold
                          is adjusted for the change in inventory. If inventory increased during the year,
                          then purchases during the year exceeded cost of goods sold, and vice versa. Acme
                          reported cost of goods sold of USD11,456 for the year ended 31 December 2018. For
                          Acme Corporation, inventory increased by USD707, so purchases from suppliers
                          was USD12,163. Purchases from suppliers affect the inventory account, as shown in
                          Exhibit 15.

                                  Beginning inventory                                   USD3,277
                                  Plus purchases                                         12,163
                                  Minus cost of goods sold                               (11,456)
                                  Ending inventory                                      USD3,984

                          Acme purchased USD12,163 of inventory from suppliers in 2018, but is this the amount
                          of cash that Acme paid to its suppliers during the year? Not necessarily. Acme may
                          not have yet paid for all of these purchases and may yet owe for some of the purchases
                          made this year. In other words, Acme may have paid less cash to its suppliers than
                          the amount of this year’s purchases, in which case Acme’s liability (accounts payable)
                          will have increased by the difference. Alternatively, Acme may have paid even more to
                          its suppliers than the amount of this year’s purchases, in which case Acme’s accounts
                          payable will have decreased.
                               Therefore, once purchases have been determined, cash paid to suppliers can be
                          calculated by adjusting purchases for the change in accounts payable. If the company
                          made all purchases with cash, then accounts payable would not change and cash
                          outflows would equal purchases. If accounts payable increased during the year, then
                          purchases on an accrual basis would be higher than they would be on a cash basis,
                          and vice versa. In this example, Acme made more purchases than it paid in cash, so
                          the balance in accounts payable increased. For Acme, the cash paid to suppliers was
                          USD11,900, determined as shown in Exhibit 16.

EXAMPLE 6

   Computing Cash Paid to Suppliers

   1. Orange Beverages Plc., a fictitious manufacturer of tropical drinks, reported
      cost of goods sold for the year of USD100 million. Total assets increased by
      USD55 million, but inventory declined by USD6 million. Total liabilities in-
      creased by USD45 million, but accounts payable decreased by USD2 million.
      How much cash did the company pay to its suppliers during the year?
      A. USD96 million
      B. USD104 million
       C. USD108 million
      Solution:
      A is correct. Cost of goods sold of USD100 million less the decrease in in-
      ventory of USD6 million equals purchases from suppliers of USD94 million.
      The decrease in accounts payable of USD2 million means that the company
      paid USD96 million in cash (USD94 million plus USD2 million).


Cash Paid to Employees
To determine the cash paid to employees, it is necessary to adjust salary and wage
expenses by the net change in salary and wages payable for the year. If salary and
wages payable increased during the year, then salary and wage expenses on an accrual
basis would be higher than the amount of cash paid for this expense, and vice versa.
For Acme, salary and wages payable increased by USD10, so cash paid for salary and
wages was USD4,113, as shown in Exhibit 18.



            Exhibit 18: Salary and Wages

         Salary and wages expense                                USD4,123

         Cash paid to employees                                 USD4,113

The amount of cash paid to employees is reflected in the salary and wages payable
account, as shown in Exhibit 19.

                                   Ending salary and wages payable                               USD85



                          Cash Paid for Other Operating Expenses
                          To determine the cash paid for other operating expenses, it is necessary to adjust the
                          other operating expense amounts on the income statement by the net changes in pre-
                          paid expenses and accrued expense liabilities for the year. If prepaid expenses increased
                          during the year, other operating expenses on a cash basis would be higher than on an
                          accrual basis, and vice versa. Likewise, if accrued expense liabilities increased during
                          the year, other operating expenses on a cash basis would be lower than on an accrual
                          basis, and vice versa. For Acme Corporation, the amount of cash paid for operating
                          expenses in 2018 was USD3,532, as shown in Exhibit 20.

                             1. Black Ice, a fictitious sportswear manufacturer, reported other operating
                                expenses of USD30 million. Prepaid insurance expense increased by USD4
                                million, and accrued utilities payable decreased by USD7 million. Insurance
                                and utilities are the only two components of other operating expenses. How
                                much cash did the company pay in other operating expenses?
                                A. USD19 million
                                B. USD33 million
                                 C. USD41 million
                                Solution:
                                C is correct. Other operating expenses of USD30 million plus the increase
                                in prepaid insurance expense of USD4 million plus the decrease in accrued
                                utilities payable of USD7 million equals USD41 million.


                          Cash Paid for Interest
                          The cash paid for interest is included in operating cash flows under US GAAP and
                          may be included in operating or financing cash flows under IFRS. To determine the
                          cash paid for interest, it is necessary to adjust interest expense by the net change in
                          interest payable for the year. If interest payable increases during the year, then interest
                          expense on an accrual basis will be higher than the amount of cash paid for interest,
                          and vice versa. For Acme Corporation, interest payable decreased by USD12, and cash
                          paid for interest was USD258, as shown in Exhibit 21.

Cash Paid for Income Taxes
To determine the cash paid for income taxes, it is necessary to adjust the income
tax expense amount on the income statement by the net changes in taxes receivable,
taxes payable, and deferred income taxes for the year. If taxes receivable or deferred
tax assets increase during the year, income taxes on a cash basis will be higher than
on an accrual basis, and vice versa. Likewise, if taxes payable or deferred tax liabilities
increase during the year, income tax expense on a cash basis will be lower than on
an accrual basis, and vice versa. For Acme Corporation, the amount of cash paid for
income taxes in 2018 was USD1,134, as shown in Exhibit 23.

         Income tax expense                                        USD1,139

THE INDIRECT METHOD FOR CASH FLOWS FROM
OPERATING ACTIVITIES                                                                          4

              statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income
              statement and balance sheet data

The alternative approach to reporting cash from operating activities is the indirect
method. In this lesson, we reconcile Acme’s net income to its operating cash flow
using the indirect method.
138   Learning Module 4                                                              Analyzing Statements of Cash Flows I



                          Operating Activities: Indirect Method
                          To perform this reconciliation, net income is adjusted for the following: (1) any
                          non-operating activities, (2) any non-cash expenses, and (3) changes in operating
                          working capital items.
                              The only non-operating activity in Acme’s income statement, the sale of equipment,
                          resulted in a gain of USD205. This amount is removed from the operating cash flow
                          section; the cash effects of the sale are shown in the investing section.
                              Acme’s only non-cash expense was a depreciation expense of USD1,052. Under
                          the indirect method, this depreciation expense must be added back to net income
                          because it was a non-cash deduction in the calculation of net income.
                              Changes in working capital accounts include increases and decreases in the cur-
                          rent operating asset and liability accounts. The changes in these accounts arise from
                          applying accrual accounting—that is, recognizing revenues when they are earned and
                          expenses when they are incurred instead of when the cash is received or paid. To make
                          the working capital adjustments under the indirect method, any increase in a current
                          operating asset account is subtracted from net income and a net decrease is added to
                          net income. As described previously, the increase in accounts receivable, for example,
                          resulted from Acme recording income statement revenue higher than the amount of
                          cash received from customers. Therefore, to reconcile back to operating cash flow,
                          that increase in accounts receivable must be deducted from net income. For current
                          operating liabilities, a net increase is added to net income and a net decrease is sub-
                          tracted from net income. As described previously, the increase in wages payable, for
                          example, resulted from Acme recording income statement expenses higher than the
                          amount of cash paid to employees.
                              Exhibit 24 presents a tabulation of the most common types of adjustments that
                          are made to net income when using the indirect method to determine net cash flow
                          from operating activities.

                          accrued expense liabilities)

Accordingly, for Acme Corporation (using Exhibits 9 and 10), the USD55 increase in
accounts receivable and the USD707 increase in inventory are subtracted from net
income and the USD23 decrease in prepaid expenses is added to net income. For
Acme’s current liabilities, the increases in accounts payable, salary and wage payable,
income tax payable, and other accrued liabilities (USD263, USD10, USD5, and USD22,
respectively) are added to net income and the USD12 decrease in interest payable is
subtracted from net income. Exhibit 25 presents the cash flow statement for Acme
Corporation under the indirect method using the information that we have determined
from our analysis of the income statement and the comparative balance sheets. Note
that the investing and financing sections are identical to the statement of cash flows
prepared using the direct method.

              5           CONVERSION FROM THE INDIRECT TO DIRECT
                          METHOD

                                        demonstrate the conversion of cash flows from the indirect to direct
                                        method

                          An analyst may desire to review direct-format operating cash flow to review trends
                          in cash receipts and payments (such as cash received from customers or cash paid
                          to suppliers). If a direct-format statement is not available, cash flows from operating
                          activities reported under the indirect method can be converted to the direct method.
                          Accuracy of conversion depends on adjustments using data available in published
                          financial reports. The method described in this lesson is sufficiently accurate for most
                          analytical purposes.


                          Method to Convert Cash Flow from Indirect to Direct
                          The three-step conversion process is demonstrated for Acme Corporation in Exhibit
                          26. Referring again to Exhibits 9 and 10 for Acme Corporation’s income statement and
                          balance sheet information, begin by disaggregating net income of USD2,210 into total
                          revenues and total expenses (Step 1). Next, remove any non-operating and non-cash
                          items (Step 2). For Acme, we therefore remove the non-operating gain on the sale of
                          equipment of USD205 and the non-cash depreciation expense of USD1,052. Then,
                          convert accrual amounts of revenues and expenses to cash flow amounts of receipts
                          and payments by adjusting for changes in working capital accounts (Step 3). The results
                          of these adjustments are the items of information for the direct format of operating
                          cash flows. These line items are shown as the results of Step 3.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

                          The second and third steps in preparing the cash flow statement are to determine the
                          total cash flows from investing activities and from financing activities. The presentation
                          of this information is identical, regardless of whether the direct or indirect method
                          is used for operating cash flows.


                          Cash Flows from Investing Activities
                          Purchases and sales of equipment were the only investing activities undertaken by
                          Acme in 2018, as evidenced by the fact that the amounts reported for land and build-
                          ings were unchanged during the year. An informational note in Exhibit 10 tells us
                          that Acme purchased new equipment in 2018 for a total cost of USD1,300. However,
                          the amount of equipment shown on Acme’s balance sheet increased by only USD243
                          (ending balance of USD8,798 minus beginning balance of USD8,555); therefore,
                          Acme must have also sold or otherwise disposed of some equipment during the year.
                          To determine the cash inflow from the sale of equipment, we analyze the equipment
                          and accumulated depreciation accounts as well as the gain on the sale of equipment
                          from Exhibits 9 and 10. Assuming that the entire accumulated depreciation is related
                          to equipment, the cash received from sale of equipment is determined as follows.
                              The historical cost of the equipment sold was USD1,057. This amount is deter-
                          mined as shown in Exhibit 27:

                          Plus equipment purchased (from informational note)                               1,300
                          Minus ending balance equipment (from balance sheet)                             (8,798)

                          The accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold was USD500, determined as
                          shown in Exhibit 28:

                          to determine the cash received from the sale, as shown in Exhibit 29:

QUESTION SET


   1. Copper, Inc., a fictitious brewery and restaurant chain, reported a
      gain on the sale of equipment of USD12 million. In addition, the company’s
      income statement shows depreciation expense of USD8 million and the cash
      flow statement shows capital expenditure of USD15 million, all of which was
      for the purchase of new equipment.



  Exhibit 30: Copper Inc.
                                               ​

    equipment                  USD30 million         USD36 million    USD6 million
                                               ​




      Using the information in Exhibit 30 from the comparative balance sheets,
      how much cash did the company receive from the equipment sale?
       A. USD12 million
       B. USD16 million
       C. USD18 million
      Solution:
      B is correct. Selling price (cash inflow) minus book value equals gain or loss
      on sale; therefore, gain or loss on sale plus book value equals selling price
      (cash inflow). The amount of gain is given, USD12 million. To calculate the
      book value of the equipment sold, find the historical cost of the equipment
      and the accumulated depreciation on the equipment.

       ■   Beginning balance of equipment of USD100 million plus equipment
           purchased of USD15 million minus ending balance of equipment of
           USD109 million equals historical cost of equipment sold, or USD6
           million.
       ■   Beginning accumulated depreciation on equipment of USD30 million
           plus depreciation expense for the year of USD8 million minus ending
           balance of accumulated depreciation of USD36 million equals accumu-
           lated depreciation on the equipment sold, or USD2 million.
       ■   Therefore, the book value of the equipment sold was USD6 million
           minus USD2 million, or USD4 million.
       ■   Because the gain on the sale of equipment was USD12 million, the

                               Solution:
                               A is correct. Selling price (cash inflow) minus book value equals gain or loss
                               on sale; therefore, gain or loss on sale plus book value equals selling price
                               (cash inflow). The amount of loss is given—USD2 million. To calculate the
                               book value of the equipment sold, find the historical cost of the equipment
                               and the accumulated depreciation on the equipment.

                                ■   Beginning balance of equipment of USD100 million plus equipment
                                    purchased of USD10 million minus ending balance of equipment of
                                    USD105 million equals the historical cost of equipment sold, or USD5
                                    million.
                                ■   Beginning accumulated depreciation of USD40 million plus depre-
                                    ciation expense for the year of USD8 million minus ending balance
                                    of accumulated depreciation of USD46 million equals accumulated
                                    depreciation on the equipment sold, or USD2 million.
                                ■   Therefore, the book value of the equipment sold was USD5 million
                                    minus USD2 million, or USD3 million.
                                ■   Because the loss on the sale of equipment was USD2 million, the
                                    amount of cash received must have been USD1 million.




              7           CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

                                       describe the steps in the preparation of direct and indirect cash flow
                                       statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income
                                       statement and balance sheet data

                          As with investing activities, the presentation of financing activities is identical,
                          regardless of whether the direct or indirect method is used for operating cash flows.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities                                                      145



Cash Flow from Financing activities: Long-Term Debt and
Common Stock
The change in long-term debt, based on the beginning 2018 (ending 2017) and ending
2018 balances in Exhibit 10, was a decrease of USD500. Absent other information,
this indicates that Acme retired USD500 of long-term debt. Retiring long-term debt
is a cash outflow relating to financing activities.
    Similarly, the change in common stock during 2018 was a decrease of USD600.
Absent other information, this indicates that Acme repurchased USD600 of its common
stock. Repurchase of common stock is also a cash outflow related to financing activity.


Computing Dividends Paid
Recall the following relationship:
   Beginning retained earnings + Net income – Dividends = Ending retained earnings
Based on this relationship, the amount of cash dividends paid in 2018 can be deter-
mined from an analysis of retained earnings, as shown in Exhibit 32.



  Exhibit 32: Analysis of Retained Earnings

Beginning balance of retained earnings (from the balance sheet)            USD2,876
Plus net income (from the income statement)                                   2,210
Minus ending balance of retained earnings (from the balance sheet)           (3,966)
Equals dividends paid                                                      USD1,120

Note that dividends paid are presented in the statement of changes in equity.

                                  Solution:
                                  A is correct. The increase of USD42 million in common stock and additional
                                  paid-in capital indicates that the company issued stock during the year. The
                                  increase in retained earnings of USD15 million indicates that the company
                                  paid USD10 million in cash dividends during the year, determined as begin-
                                  ning retained earnings of USD100 million plus net income of USD25 million
                                  minus ending retained earnings of USD115 million, which equals USD10
                                  million in cash dividends.




              8           DIFFERENCES IN CASH FLOW STATEMENTS
                          PREPARED UNDER US GAAP VERSUS IFRS

                                            contrast cash flow statements prepared under International Financial
                                            Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting
                                            principles (US GAAP)

                          The key differences between statements of cash flows prepared under IFRS and US
                          GAAP are summarized in Exhibit 34. Most significantly, IFRS allow more flexibility in
                          the reporting of such items as interest paid or received and dividends paid or received
                          and in how income tax expense is classified.
                              US GAAP classify interest and dividends received from investments as operating
                          activities, whereas IFRS allow companies to classify those items as either operating
                          or investing cash flows. Likewise, US GAAP classify interest expense as an operating
                          activity, even though the principal amount of the debt issued is classified as a financ-
                          ing activity. IFRS allow companies to classify interest expense as either an operating
                          activity or a financing activity. US GAAP classify dividends paid to stockholders as a
                          financing activity, whereas IFRS allow companies to classify dividends paid as either
                          an operating activity or a financing activity.
                              US GAAP classify all income tax expenses as an operating activity. IFRS also classify
                          income tax expense as an operating activity, unless the tax expense can be specifically
                          identified with an investing or financing activity (e.g., the tax effect of the sale of a
                          discontinued operation could be classified under investing activities).

QUESTION SET


   1. Which of the following is an example of a financing activity on the
      cash flow statement under US GAAP?
        A. Payment of interest
        B. Receipt of dividends
         C. Payment of dividends
        Solution:
        C is correct. Payment of dividends is a financing activity under US GAAP.
        Payment of interest and receipt of dividends are included in operating cash
        flows under US GAAP. Note that IFRS allow companies to include receipt
        of interest and dividends as either operating or investing cash flows and to
        include payment of interest and dividends as either operating or financing
        cash flows.

   2. Interest paid is classified as an operating cash flow under:
        A. US GAAP but may be classified as either operating or investing cash
           flows under IFRS.
        B. IFRS but may be classified as either operating or investing cash flows
           under US GAAP.
         C. US GAAP but may be classified as either operating or financing cash
            flows under IFRS.
        Solution:
        C is correct. Interest expense is always classified as an operating cash flow
        under US GAAP but may be classified as either an operating or financing
        cash flow under IFRS.

   3. Cash flows from taxes on income must be separately disclosed under:
        A. IFRS only.
        B. US GAAP only.

                             C. both IFRS and US GAAP.
                            Solution:
                            C is correct. Taxes on income are required to be separately disclosed under
                            IFRS and US GAAP. The disclosure may be in the cash flow statement or
                            elsewhere.

                          4. Mabel Corporation (MC) reported accounts receivable of USD66 million at
                             the end of its second fiscal quarter. MC had revenues of USD72 million for
                             its third fiscal quarter and reported accounts receivable of USD55 million at
                             the end of its third fiscal quarter. Based on this information, the amount of
                             cash MC collected from customers during the third fiscal quarter is:
                             A. USD61 million.
                             B. USD72 million.
                             C. USD83 million.
                            Solution:
                            C is correct. The amount of cash collected from customers during the quar-
                            ter is equal to beginning accounts receivable plus revenues minus ending
                            accounts receivable: USD66 million + USD72 million – USD55 million =
                            USD83 million. A reduction in accounts receivable indicates that cash col-
                            lected during the quarter was greater than revenue on an accrual basis.

                          5. Red Road Company, a consulting company, reported total revenues of
                             USD100 million, total expenses of USD80 million, and net income of USD20
                             million in the most recent year. If accounts receivable increased by USD10
                             million, how much cash did the company receive from customers?
                             A. USD90 million.
                             B. USD100 million.
                             C. USD110 million.
                            Solution:
                            A is correct. Revenues of USD100 million minus the increase in accounts re-
                            ceivable of USD10 million equal USD90 million cash received from custom-
                            ers. The increase in accounts receivable means that the company received
                            less in cash than it reported as revenue.

   SOLUTIONS
1. A is correct. To derive operating cash flow, the company would make the fol-
   lowing adjustments to net income: add depreciation (a non-cash expense) of
   USD7 million; add the decrease in inventory of USD3 million; add the increase in
   accounts payable of USD10 million; and subtract the increase in accounts receiv-
   able of USD15 million. Total additions of USD20 million and total subtractions of
   USD15 million result in net total additions of USD5 million.

2. B is correct. An addition to net income is made when there is a loss on the retire-
   ment of debt, which is a non-operating loss. A gain on the sale of an asset and a
   decrease in deferred tax liability are both subtracted from net-income.

3. B is correct. All dollar amounts are in millions. Net income (NI) for 2018 is
   USD35. This amount is the increase in retained earnings, USD25, plus the divi-
   dends paid, USD10. Depreciation of USD25 is added back to net income, and the
   increases in accounts receivable, USD5, and in inventory, USD3, are subtracted
   from net income because they are uses of cash. The decrease in accounts payable
   is also a use of cash and, therefore, a subtraction from net income. Thus, cash
   flow from operations is USD25 + USD10 + USD25 – USD5 – USD3 – USD7 =
   USD45.

4. B is correct. To derive operating cash flow, the company would make the fol-
   lowing adjustments to net income: Add depreciation (a non-cash expense) of
   USD2 million; add the decrease in accounts receivable of USD3 million; add the
   increase in accounts payable of USD5 million; and subtract the increase in inven-
   tory of USD4 million. Total additions would be USD10 million, and total subtrac-
   tions would be USD4 million, which gives net additions of USD6 million.

5. A is correct.
   Operating cash flows
   = Cash received from customers – (Cash paid to suppliers + Cash paid to employ-
   ees + Cash paid for other operating expenses + Cash paid for interest + Cash paid
   for income taxes)

   Cash received from customers = Revenue + Decrease in accounts receivable

   = USD37 + USD3 = USD40 million

   Cash paid to suppliers
   = Cost of goods sold + Increase in inventory + Decrease in accounts payable

   = USD16 + USD4 + USD2 = USD22 million
   Therefore, the company’s operating cash flow = USD40 – USD22 – Cash paid for
   salaries – Cash paid for interest – Cash paid for taxes = USD40 – USD22 – USD6
   – USD2 – USD4 = USD6 million.

6. C is correct. Cost of goods sold of USD80 million plus the increase in inventory
   of USD5 million equals purchases from suppliers of USD85 million. The increase
   in accounts payable of USD2 million means that the company paid USD83 mil-
   lion in cash (USD85 million minus USD2 million) to its suppliers.

7. A is correct. Cost of goods sold of USD75 million less the decrease in inventory
   of USD6 million equals purchases from suppliers of USD69 million. The increase

                             in accounts payable of USD2 million means that the company paid USD67 mil-
                             lion in cash (USD69 million minus USD2 million).

                          8. C is correct. Beginning salaries payable of USD3 million plus salaries expense of
                             USD20 million minus ending salaries payable of USD1 million equals USD22 mil-
                             lion. Alternatively, the expense of USD20 million plus the USD2 million decrease
                             in salaries payable equals USD22 million.

                          9. C is correct. Cash received from customers = Sales + Decrease in accounts
                             receivable = 254.6 + 4.9 = 259.5. Cash paid to suppliers = Cost of goods sold +
                             Increase in inventory – Increase in accounts payable = 175.9 + 8.8 – 2.6 = 182.1.

                          10. C is correct. Interest expense of USD19 million less the increase in interest pay-
                              able of USD3 million equals interest paid of USD16 million. Tax expense of USD6
                              million plus the decrease in taxes payable of USD4 million equals taxes paid of
                              USD10 million.

                          11. A is correct. The amount of cash paid to suppliers is calculated as follows:
                             = Cost of goods sold – Decrease in inventory – Increase in accounts payable

                             = USD27,264 – USD501 – USD1,063

                             = USD25,700.

              2           EVALUATING SOURCES AND USES OF CASH

                                        analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow
                                        statements

                          Evaluation of the cash flow statement should involve an overall assessment of the
                          sources and uses of cash between the three main categories as well as an assessment
                          of the main drivers of cash flow within each category, as follows:
                               Step 1   Evaluate the major sources and uses of cash flow, including operating,
                                        investing, and financing activities.

                               Step 2   Evaluate the primary determinants of operating cash flow.

                               Step 3   Evaluate the primary determinants of investing cash flow.

                               Step 4   Evaluate the primary determinants of financing cash flow.




                          Step 1. Evaluate the major sources and uses of cash flow
                          The major sources of cash for a company can vary with its stage of growth. For a mature
                          company, it is expected and desirable that operating activities are the primary source
                          of cash flows. Over the long term, a company must generate cash from its operating
                          activities. If operating cash flow were consistently negative, a company would need
                          to borrow money or issue stock (financing activities) to fund the shortfall. Eventually,
                          these providers of capital need to be repaid from operations or they will no longer
                          be willing to provide capital. Cash generated from operating activities can be used in
                          either investing or financing activities. If the company has value-creative investment
                          opportunities, it is desirable to use the cash in investing activities. If the company
                          does not have profitable investment opportunities, the cash should be returned to
                          capital providers, a financing activity.
                              For a new or growth stage company, operating cash flow may be negative for some
                          period of time as it invests in such assets as inventory and receivables (extending credit
                          to new customers) to grow the business. This situation is not sustainable over the long
                          term, so eventually the cash must start to come primarily from operating activities
                          so that capital can be returned to the providers of capital. Lastly, it is desirable that
                          operating cash flows are sufficient to cover capital expenditures (in other words, the
                          company has free cash flow as discussed further in Lesson 3). In summary, major
                          points to consider at this step are:
                              ■   What are the major sources and uses of cash flow?
                              ■   Is operating cash flow positive and sufficient to cover capital expenditures?


                          Step 2. Evaluate the primary determinants of operating cash flow
                          Turning to the operating section, analysts should examine the most significant deter-
                          minants of operating cash flow. Companies need cash for use in operations (e.g., to
                          hold receivables and inventory and to pay employees and suppliers) and receive cash
                          from operating activities (e.g., payments from customers). Increases and decreases
                          in receivables, inventory, payables, and so on can be examined to determine whether
                          the company is using or generating cash in operations and why.
Evaluating Sources and Uses of Cash                                                        157


    It is also useful to compare operating cash flow with net income. For a mature
company, because net income includes non-cash expenses (depreciation and amor-
tization), it is expected and desirable that operating cash flow exceeds net income.
The relationship between net income and operating cash flow is also an indicator of
earnings quality. If a company has large net income but poor operating cash flow,
it may be a sign of poor earnings quality. The company may be making aggressive
accounting choices to increase net income but may not be generating cash for its
business. Analysts also should examine the variability of both earnings and cash flow
and consider the impact of this variability on the company’s risk as well as the ability
to forecast future cash flows for valuation purposes. In summary:
    ■   What are the major determinants of operating cash flow?
    ■   Is operating cash flow higher or lower than net income? Why?
    ■   How consistent are operating cash flows?


Step 3. Evaluate the primary determinants of investing cash flow
Within the investing section, analysts should evaluate each line item. Each line item
represents either a source or use of cash. This enables analysts to understand where
the cash is being spent (or received). This section will reveal how much cash is being
invested for the future in property, plant, and equipment; how much is used to acquire
entire companies; and how much is put aside in liquid investments, such as stocks and
bonds. It will also tell show how much cash is being raised by selling these types of
assets. If the company is making major capital investments, analysts should consider
where the cash is coming from to cover these investments (e.g., is the cash coming
from excess operating cash flow or from the financing activities described in Step 4).
If assets are being sold, it is important to determine why and to assess the effects on
the company.

Step 4. Evaluate the primary determinants of financing cash flow
Within the financing section, analysts should examine each line item to understand
whether the company is raising capital or repaying capital and what the nature of its
capital sources are. If the company is borrowing each year, analysts should consider
when repayment may be required. The financing section will also present dividend
payments and repurchases of stock that are alternative means of returning capital to
owners. It is important to assess why capital is being raised or repaid.

EXAMPLE 1

   Analysis of the Cash Flow Statement
   Derek Yee, CFA, is preparing to forecast cash flow for Groupe Danone as an
   input into his valuation model. He reviews the historical cash flow statement of
   Groupe Danon for 2016 and 2017, which is presented in Exhibit 1, and excerpts
   from Danone’s 2017 Registration Document, which is presented in Exhibit 2.
   Yee notes that Groupe Danone prepares its financial statements in conformity
   with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

      Exhibit 2: Excerpt from Groupe Danone 2017 Registration Statement

      Footnote 2 to the financial statements:
          “On July 7, 2016, Danone announced the signing of an agreement to
      acquire The WhiteWave Foods Company (“WhiteWave”), the global leader
      in plant-based foods and beverages and organic produce. The acquisition in
      cash, for USD 56.25 per share, represented, as of the date of the agreement,
      a total enterprise value of approximately USD 12.5 billion, including debt
      and certain other WhiteWave liabilities. …
          “Acquisition expenses recognized in Danone’s consolidated financial
      statements totaled €51 million before tax, of which €48 million was rec-
      ognized in 2016 in Other operating income (expense), with the balance
      recognized in 2017.
          “WhiteWave’s contribution to 2017 consolidated sales totaled €2.7 bil-
      lion. Had the transaction been completed on January 1, 2017, the Group’s
      2017 consolidated sales would have been €25.7 billion, with recurring
      operating income of €3.6 billion.
          “Meanwhile, integration expenses for the period totaled €91 million,
      recognized under Other operating income (expense).”
          Overview of Activities:
          “As part of its transformation plan aimed at ensuring a safe journey to
      deliver strong, profitable and sustainable growth, Danone set objectives
      for 2020 that include like-for-like sales growth between 4% and 5% …. a
      recurring operating margin of over 16% in 2020 … Finally, Danone will
      continue to focus on growing its free cash flow, which will contribute
      to financial deleverage with an objective of a ratio of Net debt/EBITDA
      below 3x in 2020. Danone is committed to reaching a ROIC level around
      12% in 2020.”

                            1. What are the major sources and uses of cash for Groupe Danone?
                               Solution:
                               The major categories of cash flows can be summarized as follows (in EUR
                               millions):
                                                                        ​

                               The primary source of cash for Groupe Danone in 2016 was operating ac-
                               tivities of 2,652. During that year, the company spent 925 on capital expen-
                               ditures, representing most of the outflow of 848 from investing activities.
                               In 2017, however, the primary source of cash for Groupe Danone was from
                               financing activities. The investing section shows significant use of cash in
                               2017 for purchase of subsidiaries within investing activities.

                            2. Is cash flow from operating activities sufficient to cover capital
                               expenditures?
                               Solution:
                               Yes, in both 2016 and 2017, there was sufficient operating cash flow to cover
                               usual capital expenditures.

                            3. What is the relationship between net income and cash flow from operating
                               activities?
                               Solution:
                               In both years, operating cash flow exceeded net income. The fact that oper-
                               ating cash flow exceeds net income in both years is a positive sign.

                            4. What types of financing cash flows does Groupe Danone have?
                               Solution:
                               Footnotes disclose a major acquisition with an aggregate value of USD12.5
                               billion, some of which was funded through proceeds from an earlier bond
                               issuance, which appears as a financing cash flow in the financing section for
                               2016.




              3           RATIOS AND COMMON-SIZE ANALYSIS

                                        calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to
                                        equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios

                          In common-size analysis of a company’s income statement, each income and expense
                          line item is expressed as a percentage of net revenues (net sales). For the common-size
                          balance sheet, each asset, liability, and equity line item is expressed as a percentage
Ratios and Common-Size Analysis                                                            161


of total assets. The common-size cash flow statement has two alternative approaches.
The first approach is to express each line item of cash inflow (outflow) as a percentage
of total inflows (outflows) of cash, and the second approach is to express each line
item as a percentage of net revenue. The common-size format makes it easier to see
trends in cash flow rather than just looking at the total amount.
    Consider the statement of cash flows for Acme Corporation in Exhibit 3. Exhibit
4 demonstrates the total cash inflows/total cash outflows common-size method for
Acme Corporation. Under this approach, each of the cash inflows is expressed as a
percentage of the total cash inflows, whereas each of the cash outflows is expressed as
a percentage of the total cash outflows. In Panel A, Acme’s common-size statement is
based on a cash flow statement using the direct method of presenting operating cash
flows. Operating cash inflows and outflows are separately presented on the cash flow
statement, and therefore, the common-size cash flow statement shows each of these
operating inflows (outflows) as a percentage of total inflows (outflows).
    In Panel B of Exhibit 4, Acme’s common-size statement is based on a cash flow
statement using the indirect method of presenting operating cash flows. When a
cash flow statement has been presented using the indirect method, operating cash
inflows and outflows are not separately presented; therefore, the common-size cash
flow statement shows only the net operating cash flow (net cash provided by or used
in operating activities) as a percentage of total inflows or outflows, depending on
whether the net amount was a cash inflow or outflow. Because Acme’s net operating
cash flow is positive, it is shown as a percentage of total inflows.

statement in Exhibit 5 has been developed based on Acme’s cash flow statement using
the indirect method for operating cash flows and using net revenue (cash received
from customers) for the company in 2018 of USD23,598 from Exhibit 3.
    This method is also useful to the analyst in forecasting future cash flows because
individual items in the common-size statement (e.g., depreciation, fixed capital
expenditures, debt borrowing, and repayment) are expressed as a percentage of net
revenue. Thus, once the analyst has forecasted revenue, the common-size statement
provides a basis for forecasting cash flows for those items with an expected relation
to net revenue.

  2. Based on the information in Exhibit 6, discuss the trends in Apple’s:

      A. depreciation and amortization expense.
      B. capital expenditures.
     Solution:

      A. Apple’s depreciation and amortization expense was consistently just
         less than 5 percent of total net revenue in 2015 and 2016, declining to
         4.4 percent in 2017.
      B. Apple’s level of capital expenditures is greater than its depreciation
         and amortization in 2016 and 2017, whereas it was at about the same
         level as depreciation and amortization in 2015. In 2017, capital expen-
         ditures approached 6 percent. This is an indication that Apple is doing

                                    more than replacing property, plant, and equipment, and is expand-
                                    ing those investments. With cash generated from operating activities
                                    exceeding 27 percent of sales in every year, however, Apple has more
                                    than enough cash flow from operations to fund these expenditures.

                             3. Compare Apple’s operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue with Ap-
                                ple’s net profit margin.
                                Solution:
                                Apple’s operating cash flow as a percentage of sales is much higher than net
                                profit margin in every year. This gap appears to be declining however over
                                the three-year period. In 2015 net profit margin was 22.8 percent, while
                                operating cash flow as a percentage of sales was 34.8 percent. By 2017, the
                                net profit margin declined slightly to 21.1 percent, while the operating cash
                                flow as a percentage of sales declined more to 27.7 percent. The primary
                                difference appears to have been an increase in the level of receivables and
                                inventory purchases, somewhat offset by an increase in accounts payable.

                             4. Discuss Apple’s use of its positive operating cash flow.
                                Solution:
                                Apple generated a large amount of operating cash flow each year, exceeding
                                net income. This cash flow is used for relatively modest purchases of prop-
                                erty, plant, and equipment, substantial purchases of marketable securities
                                (investments), dividend payments and repurchases of its own stock.




              4           FREE CASH FLOW MEASURES

                                        calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to
                                        equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios

                          As noted earlier, it is desirable that operating cash flows are sufficient to cover capital
                          expenditures. The excess of operating cash flow over capital expenditures is known
                          generically as free cash flow. For purposes of valuing a company or its equity secu-
                          rities, an analyst may want to determine and use other cash flow measures, such as
                          free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) or free cash flow to equity (FCFE).
                              FCFF is the cash flow available to both debt and equity investors after all operat-
                          ing expenses (including income taxes) have been paid and necessary investments in
                          working capital and fixed capital have been made. FCFF can be computed starting
                          with net income as follows:
                             FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv – WCInv
Free Cash Flow Measures                                                                    167


where:

         NI = Net income,

       NCC = Non-cash charges (such as depreciation and amortization),

         Int = Interest expense,

     FCInv = Capital expenditures (fixed capital, such as equipment), and

    WCInv = Working capital expenditures.
   The reason for adding back interest is that FCFF is the cash flow available to the
suppliers of debt capital as well as equity capital. Conveniently, FCFF can also be
computed from cash flow from operating activities as follows
    FCFF = CFO + Int(1 – Tax rate) – FCInv.
CFO represents cash flow from operating activities under US GAAP or under IFRS,
where the company has included interest paid in operating activities. If interest paid
was included in financing activities, then CFO does not have to be adjusted for Int(1
– Tax rate). Under IFRS, if the company has placed interest and dividends received
in investing activities, these should be added back to CFO to determine FCFF.
Additionally, if dividends paid were subtracted in the operating section, these should
be added back in to compute FCFF.
    Assuming a marginal tax rate of 34 percent for Acme in 2018, the computation of

aIncome tax rate of 0.34 = (Tax expense ÷ Pretax income) = ($1,139 ÷ $3,349).


FCFE is the cash flow available to the company’s common stockholders after all
operating expenses and borrowing costs (principal and interest) have been paid and
necessary investments in working capital and fixed capital have been made. FCFE
can be computed as follows:
    FCFE = CFO – FCInv + Net borrowing.
When net borrowing is negative, debt repayments exceed receipts of borrowed funds.
In this case, FCFE can be expressed as follows:
    FCFE = CFO – FCInv – Net debt repayment.
The computation of FCFE for Acme Corporation (again, based on the data from
Exhibit 3) is shown in Exhibit 8.

                                   Positive FCFE means that the company has an excess of operating cash flow over
                                   amounts needed for capital expenditures and repayment of debt. This cash would be
                                   available for distribution to owners.

                                                    calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to
                                                    equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios

                                   Ratios based on information in statements of cash flows can be used to compare the
                                   performance and prospects of different companies in an industry and of different
                                   industries. These ratios generally fall into cash flow performance (profitability) ratios
                                   and cash flow coverage (solvency) ratios. Exhibit 9 summarizes the calculation and
                                   interpretation of some of these ratios.

Notes:

          a If the company reports under IFRS and includes total dividends paid as a
          use of cash in the operating section, total dividends should be added back to
          CFO as reported and then preferred dividends should be subtracted. Recall
          that CFO reported under US GAAP and IFRS may differ depending on the
          treatment of interest and dividends, received and paid.
          b If the company reports under IFRS and included interest paid as a use of
          cash in the financing section, then interest paid should not be added back to
          the numerator.

         What is Potter most likely to conclude about the relative operating
         cash-flow-generating ability of these two companies?
         Solution:
         On both measures—operating cash flow divided by revenue and operating
         cash flow divided by assets—both companies have overall strong results.
         However, Microsoft has higher cash flow from operating activities as a
         percentage of revenues in both 2016 and 2017. Further, Microsoft has an
         increasing trend. While Apple had a higher operating cash flow as a percent
         of revenue in 2015 compared to Microsoft, it has had a declining trend and
         was below Microsoft in the two more recent years. Microsoft’s operating

                          cash flow relative to assets is the same as Apple’s in 2017 and relatively
                          stable with a slight increase since 2015. Apple started the three years with
                          a much stronger ratio but saw a declining trend such that its ratio is now at
                          the same level as Microsoft. We should note that this ratio is heavily influ-
                          enced by substantial investments in financial instruments that Apple has
                          made over the years due to its strong historic cash flow.

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS
1. One appropriate method of preparing a common-size cash flow statement is to
   show each line item:
   A. of revenue and expense as a percentage of net revenue.

   B. on the cash flow statement as a percentage of net revenue.

   C. on the cash flow statement as a percentage of total cash outflows.

2. Which of the following is an appropriate method of computing free cash flow to
   the firm?
   A. Add operating cash flows to capital expenditures and deduct after-tax inter-
      est payments.

   B. Add operating cash flows to after-tax interest payments and deduct capital
      expenditures.

   C. Deduct both after-tax interest payments and capital expenditures from
      operating cash flows.

3. The first step in cash flow statement analysis should be to:
   A. evaluate consistency of cash flows.

   B. determine operating cash flow drivers.

   C. identify the major sources and uses of cash.

4. An analyst has calculated a ratio using as the numerator the sum of operating
   cash flow, interest, and taxes and as the denominator the amount of interest.
   What is this ratio, what does it measure, and what does it indicate?
   A. This ratio is an interest coverage ratio, measuring a company’s ability to
      meet its interest obligations and indicating a company’s solvency.

   B. This ratio is an effective tax ratio, measuring the amount of a company’s
      operating cash flow used for taxes and indicating a company’s efficiency in
      tax management.

   C. This ratio is an operating profitability ratio, measuring the operating cash
      flow generated accounting for taxes and interest and indicating a company’s
      liquidity.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. B is correct. An appropriate method to prepare a common-size cash flow state-
                             ment is to show each line item on the cash flow statement as a percentage of net
                             revenue. An alternative way to prepare a statement of cash flows is to show each
                             item of cash inflow as a percentage of total inflows and each item of cash out-
                             flows as a percentage of total outflows.

                          2. B is correct. Free cash flow to the firm can be computed as operating cash flows
                             plus after-tax interest expense less capital expenditures.

                          3. C is correct. An overall assessment of the major sources and uses of cash should
                             be the first step in evaluating a cash flow statement.

                          4. A is correct. This ratio is an interest coverage ratio, measuring a company’s ability
                             to meet its interest obligations and indicating a company’s solvency. This cov-
                             erage ratio is based on cash flow information; another common formulation of
                             the interest coverage ratio uses EBITDA based on the income statement as the
                             numerator.

                                  ■   Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), invento-
                                      ries are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net
                                      realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course
                                      of business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Under
                                      US GAAP, inventories are measured at the lower of cost, market value,
                                      or net realizable value depending upon the inventory method used.
                                      Market value is defined as the current replacement cost subject to an
                                      upper limit of net realizable value and a lower limit of net realizable
                                      value less a normal profit margin. Reversals of previous write-downs
                                      are permissible under IFRS but not under US GAAP.
                                  ■   Reversals of inventory write-downs may occur under IFRS but are not
                                      allowed under US GAAP.

                                      as raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods) may provide
                                      signals about a company’s future sales and profits. Relevant informa-
                                      tion with respect to inventory management and future sales may be

                                      details of the inventory carrying amounts and costs. This information
                                      can greatly assist analysts in their evaluation of a company’s inventory

              2           INVENTORY VALUATION

                                          describe the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net
                                          realisable value and its implications for financial statements and
                                          ratios

                          Significant financial risk can result from the holding of inventory. The cost of inventory
                          may not be recoverable due to spoilage, obsolescence, or declines in selling prices.
                          IFRS states that inventories shall be measured (and carried on the balance sheet) at
                          the lower of cost and net realizable value.1Net realizable value is the estimated selling
                          price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make
                          the sale and estimated costs to get the inventory in condition for sale. The assessment
                          of net realizable value is typically done item by item or by groups of similar or related
                          items. In the event that the value of inventory declines below the carrying amount
                          on the balance sheet, the inventory carrying amount must be written down to its net

Inventory Valuation                                                                                       175


realizable value2 and the loss (reduction in value) recognized as an expense on the
income statement. This expense may be included as part of cost of sales or reported
separately.
     In each subsequent period, a new assessment of net realizable value is made.
Reversal (limited to the amount of the original write-down) is required for a sub-
sequent increase in value of inventory previously written down. The reversal of any
write-down of inventories is recognized as a reduction in cost of sales (reduction in
the amount of inventories recognized as an expense).
     US GAAP used to specify the lower of cost or market to value inventories.3 For
fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2016, inventories measured using other than
last-in, first-out (LIFO) and retail inventory methods are measured at the lower of cost
or net realizable value. This is broadly consistent with IFRS with one major difference:
US GAAP prohibits the reversal of write-downs. For inventories measured using LIFO
and retail inventory methods, market value is defined as current replacement cost
subject to upper and lower limits. Market value cannot exceed net realizable value
(i.e., the selling price less reasonably estimated costs of completion and disposal). The
lower limit of market value is net realizable value less a normal profit margin. Any
write-down to market value or net realizable value reduces the value of the inventory,
and the loss in value (expense) generally is reflected in the income statement in the
cost of goods sold.
     An inventory write-down reduces both profit and the carrying amount of inventory
on the balance sheet and thus has a negative effect on profitability, liquidity, and sol-
vency ratios. However, activity ratios (e.g., inventory turnover and total asset turnover)
will be positively affected by a write-down because the asset base (denominator) is
reduced. The negative impact on some key ratios, due to the decrease in profit, may
result in the reluctance by some companies to record inventory write-downs unless
evidence is strong that the decline in the value of inventory is permanent. This is
especially true under US GAAP, in which case reversal of a write-down is prohibited.
     International Accounting Standards 2 (IAS 2), Inventories, does not apply to the
inventories of producers of agricultural and forest products and minerals and mineral
products, nor to commodity broker–traders. These inventories may be measured at net
realizable value (fair value less costs to sell and complete) according to well-established
industry practices. If an active market exists for these products, the quoted market
price in that market is the appropriate basis for determining the fair value of that
asset. If an active market does not exist, a company may use market determined
prices or values (such as the most recent market transaction price) when available for
determining fair value. Changes in the value of inventory (increase or decrease) are
recognized in profit or loss in the period of the change. US GAAP is similar to IFRS
in its treatment of inventories of agricultural and forest products and mineral ores.
Mark-to-market inventory accounting is allowed for bullion.

   Accounting for Declines and Recoveries of Inventory
   Value
   Hatsumei Enterprises, a hypothetical company, manufactures computers and
   prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS. In 2017, the cost of
   ending inventory was EUR5.2 million, but its net realizable value was EUR4.9

2 Frequently, rather than writing down inventory directly, an inventory valuation allowance account is
used. The allowance account is netted with the inventory accounts to arrive at the carrying amount that
appears on the balance sheet.

                             million. The current replacement cost of the inventory is EUR4.7 million. This
                             figure exceeds the net realizable value less a normal profit margin. In 2018, the
                             net realizable value of Hatsumei’s inventory was EUR0.5 million greater than
                             the carrying amount.

                             1. What was the effect of the write-down on Hatsumei’s 2017 financial state-
                                ments? What was the effect of the recovery on Hatsumei’s 2018 financial
                                statements?
                                Solution:
                                For 2017, Hatsumei would write down its inventory to EUR4.9 million and
                                record the change in value of EUR0.3 million as an expense on the income
                                statement. For 2018, Hatsumei would increase the carrying amount of its
                                inventory and reduce the cost of sales by EUR0.3 million (the recovery is
                                limited to the amount of the original write-down).

                             2. Under US GAAP, if Hatsumei used the LIFO method, what would be the
                                effects of the write-down on Hatsumei’s 2017 financial statements and of the
                                recovery on Hatsumei’s 2018 financial statements?
                                Solution:
                                Under US GAAP, for 2017, Hatsumei would write down its inventory to
                                EUR4.7 million and typically include the change in value of EUR0.5 million
                                in cost of goods sold on the income statement. For 2018, Hatsumei would
                                not reverse the write-down.

                             3. What would be the effect of the recovery on Hatsumei’s 2018 financial
                                statements if Hatsumei’s inventory were agricultural products instead of
                                computers?
                                Solution:
                                If Hatsumei’s inventory were agricultural products instead of computers, in-
                                ventory would be measured at net realizable value and Hatsumei, therefore,
                                would increase inventory and record a gain of EUR0.5 million for 2018.

                              Analysts should consider the possibility of an inventory write-down because the
                          impact on a company’s financial ratios may be substantial. The potential for inven-
                          tory write-downs can be high for companies in industries in which technological
                          obsolescence of inventories is a significant risk. Analysts should carefully evaluate
                          prospective inventory impairments (as well as other potential asset impairments) and
                          their potential effects on the financial ratios when debt covenants include financial
                          ratio requirements. The breaching of debt covenants can have a significant impact
                          on a company.
                              Companies that use specific identification, weighted average cost, or FIFO methods
                          are more likely to incur inventory write-downs than companies that use the LIFO
                          method. Under the LIFO method, the oldest costs are reflected in the inventory car-
                          rying amount on the balance sheet. Given increasing inventory costs, the inventory
                          carrying amounts under the LIFO method are already conservatively presented at the
                          oldest and lowest costs. Thus, it is far less likely that inventory write-downs will occur
                          under LIFO—and if a write-down does occur, it is likely to be of a lesser magnitude.

                               Inventories are reported at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
                           The cost is established using the first-in, first-out principle (FIFO) and is
                           based on the standard cost method, including costs for all direct manu-
                           facturing expenses and the attributable share of capacity and other related
                           manufacturing-related costs. The standard costs are tested regularly and
                           adjustments are made based on current conditions. Costs for research
                           and development, selling, administration and financial expenses are not
                           included. Net realizable value is calculated as the selling price less costs
                           attributable to the sale.

                               Inventory obsolescence
                               If the net realizable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance
                           is established for inventory obsolescence. The total inventory value, net
                           of inventory obsolescence allowance, was SEK52,701 (in millions) as of
                           December 2017, and SEK48,287 as of 31 December 2016.

  2. Assuming that any changes to the allowance for inventory obsolescence are
     reflected in the cost of sales, what amount would Volvo’s cost of sales be for
     2017 and 2016 if it had not recorded inventory write-downs in 2017 and
     2016?

  * From Note 17, the decrease in the allowance for obsolescence for 2017 is 194 (3,489 – 3,683) and
  the increase for 2016 is 59 (3,683 – 3,624).



  3. What amount would Volvo’s profit (net income) be for 2017 and 2016 if it
     had not recorded inventory write-downs in 2017 and 2016? Volvo’s effec-
     tive income tax rate was reported as 25 percent for 2017 and 31 percent for
     2016.

                             Inventory turnover is higher based on the numbers as reported because
                             inventory carrying amounts will be lower with an allowance for inventory

                              With allowance (as reported) = 72.4 days = (365 days ÷ 5.04)

                              Without allowance (adjusted) = 77.5 days = (365 days ÷ 4.71)
                             Days of inventory on hand are lower based on the numbers as report-
                             ed because the inventory turnover is higher. A company with inventory
                             write-downs might appear to manage its inventory more effectively. This is
                             primarily the result of the lower inventory carrying amounts.

       Gross profit margin = Gross profit ÷ Net sales

       With allowance (as reported) = 23.95% = (80,167 ÷ 334,748)

       Without allowance (adjusted) = 23.89% = [(80,167 − 194) ÷ 334,748]
      In this instance, the gross profit margin is slightly higher with inventory
      write-downs because the cost of sales is lower (due to the reduction in the
      allowance for inventory obsolescence). This assumes that inventory write-
      downs (and inventory write-down recoveries) are reported as part of cost of
      sales.
       Net profit margin = Profit ÷ Net sales

       With allowance (as reported) = 6.36% = (21,283 ÷ 334,748)

       Without allowance (adjusted) = 6.31% = (21,138 ÷ 334,748)
      In this instance, the net profit margin is higher with inventory write-downs
      because the cost of sales is lower (due to the reduction in the allowance for
      inventory obsolescence). The absolute percentage difference is less than
      that of the gross profit margin because of the income tax reduction on the
      decreased income without write-downs.
      The profitability ratios (gross profit margin and net profit margin) for Volvo
      Group would have been slightly lower for 2017 if the company had not
      recorded inventory write-downs. The activity ratio (inventory turnover
      ratio) would appear less attractive without the write-downs. The inventory
      turnover ratio is slightly better (higher) with inventory write-downs because
      inventory write-downs decrease the average inventory (denominator), mak-
      ing inventory management appear more efficient with write-downs.




THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION ON
INVENTORIES, COSTS OF SALES, AND GROSS MARGIN                                                 3

               affect the financial statements and ratios of companies that use
               different inventory valuation methods

The allocation of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost of sales on the income
statement and to ending inventory on the balance sheet varies under the different
inventory valuation methods. In an environment of declining inventory unit costs and
constant or increasing inventory quantities, first-in, first-out (FIFO) (in comparison
with weighted average cost or LIFO) will allocate a higher amount of the total cost of
goods available for sale to cost of sales on the income statement and a lower amount
to ending inventory on the balance sheet. Accordingly, because cost of sales will be
higher under FIFO, a company’s gross profit, operating profit, and income before
taxes will be lower.
    Conversely, in an environment of rising inventory unit costs and constant or
increasing inventory quantities, FIFO (in comparison with weighted average cost or
LIFO) will allocate a lower amount of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost

                          of sales on the income statement and a higher amount to ending inventory on the
                          balance sheet. Accordingly, because cost of sales will be lower under FIFO, a company’s
                          gross profit, operating profit, and income before taxes will be higher.
                              The carrying amount of inventories under FIFO will more closely reflect current
                          replacement values because inventories are assumed to consist of the most recently
                          purchased items. The cost of sales under LIFO will more closely reflect current replace-
                          ment value. LIFO ending inventory amounts typically are not reflective of current
                          replacement value because the ending inventory is assumed to be the oldest inventory
                          and costs are allocated accordingly. Example 3 illustrates the different results obtained
                          by using either the FIFO or LIFO methods to account for inventory.

                             Company L and Company F are identical in all respects except that Company L
                             uses the LIFO method and Company F uses the FIFO method. Each company
                             has been in business for five years and maintains a base inventory of 2,000
                             units each year. Each year, except the first year, the number of units purchased
                             equaled the number of units sold. Over the five year period, unit sales increased
                             10 percent each year and the unit purchase and selling prices increased at the
                             beginning of each year to reflect inflation of 4 percent per year. In the first year,
                             20,000 units were sold at a price of USD15.00 per unit and the unit purchase
                             price was USD8.00.

                             a Inventory is unchanged at USD16,000 each year (2,000 units × USD8). 2,000 of the units
                             acquired in the first year are assumed to remain in inventory.
                             b Sales Year X = (20,000 × USD15)(1.10)X–1(1.04)X–1. The quantity sold increases by 10 percent
                             each year and the selling price increases by 4 percent each year.
                             c Cost of sales Year X = (20,000 × USD8)(1.10)X–1(1.04)X–1. In Year 1, 20,000 units are sold with
                             a cost of USD8. In subsequent years, the number of units purchased equals the number of units
                             sold and the units sold are assumed to be those purchased in the year. The quantity purchased
                             increases by 10 percent each year and the purchase price increases by 4 percent each year.

                                If the company sold more units than it purchased in a year, inventory would
                                decrease. This is referred to as LIFO liquidation. The cost of sales of the
                                units sold in excess of those purchased would reflect the inventory carrying
                                amount. In this example, each unit sold in excess of those purchased would
                                have a cost of sales of USD8 and a higher gross profit.

       Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of sales ÷ Ending inventory.
      The inventory turnover ratio increased each year for both companies
      because the units sold increased, whereas the units in ending inventory
      remained unchanged. The increase in the inventory turnover ratio is higher
      for Company L because Company L’s cost of sales is increasing for infla-
      tion, but the inventory carrying amount is unaffected by inflation. It might
      appear that a company using the LIFO method manages its inventory more
      effectively, but this is deceptive. Both companies have identical quantities
      and prices of purchases and sales and only differ in the inventory valuation
      method used.
       Gross profit margin = Gross profit ÷ Sales.
      The gross profit margin is stable under LIFO because both sales and cost of
      sales increase at the same rate of inflation. The gross profit margin is slightly

                                         describe the presentation and disclosures relating to inventories
                                         and explain issues that analysts should consider when examining a
                                         company’s inventory disclosures and other sources of information

                          The choice of inventory valuation method affects the financial statements. The financial
                          statement items affected include cost of sales, gross profit, net income, inventories,
                          current assets, and total assets. Therefore, the choice of inventory valuation method
                          also affects financial ratios that contain these items. Ratios such as current ratio,
                          return on assets, gross profit margin, and inventory turnover also are affected. As a
                          consequence, analysts must carefully consider inventory valuation method differences
                          when evaluating a company’s performance over time or when comparing its perfor-
                          mance with the performance of the industry or industry competitors. Additionally,
                          the financial statement items and ratios may be affected by adjustments of inventory
                          carrying amounts to net realizable value or current replacement cost.


                          Presentation and Disclosure
                          IFRS requires the following financial statement disclosures concerning inventory:
                             a. the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the cost
                                formula (inventory valuation method) used;

                             b. the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in clas-
                                sifications (e.g., merchandise, raw materials, production supplies, work in
                                progress, and finished goods) appropriate to the entity;

                             c. the carrying amount of inventories carried at fair value less costs to sell;

                             d. the amount of inventories recognized as an expense during the period (cost
                                of sales);

                             e. the amount of any write-down of inventories recognized as an expense in
                                the period;

                             f.    the amount of any reversal of any write-down that is recognized as a reduc-
                                   tion in cost of sales in the period;

                             g. the circumstances or events that led to the reversal of a write-down of
                                inventories; and

                             h. the carrying amount of inventories pledged as security for liabilities.
                              Inventory-related disclosures under US GAAP are similar to these disclosures,
                          except that requirements (f ) and (g) are not relevant because US GAAP does not
                          permit the reversal of prior-year inventory write-downs. US GAAP also requires the
                          disclosure of significant estimates applicable to inventories and of any material amount
                          of income resulting from the liquidation of LIFO inventory.

Inventory Ratios
Three ratios often used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of inventory man-
agement are inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, and gross profit margin.5
These ratios are directly affected by a company’s choice of inventory valuation method.
Analysts should be aware, however, that many other ratios are also affected by the
choice of inventory valuation method, although less directly. These include the current
ratio, because inventory is a component of current assets; the return-on-assets ratio,
because cost of sales is a key component in deriving net income and inventory is a
component of total assets; and even the debt-to-equity ratio, because the cumulative
measured net income from the inception of a business is an aggregate component of
retained earnings.
    The inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times during the year a
company sells (i.e., turns over) its inventory. The higher the turnover ratio, the more
times that inventory is sold during the year and the lower the relative investment of
resources in inventory. Days of inventory on hand can be calculated as days in the
period divided by inventory turnover. Thus, inventory turnover and days of inventory
on hand are inversely related. It may be that inventory turnover, however, is calculated
using average inventory in the year, whereas days of inventory on hand is based on
the ending inventory amount. In general, inventory turnover and the number of days
of inventory on hand should be benchmarked against industry norms and compared
across years.
    A high inventory turnover ratio and a low number of days of inventory on hand
might indicate highly effective inventory management. Alternatively, a high inventory
ratio and a low number of days of inventory on hand could indicate that the company
does not carry an adequate amount of inventory or that the company has written
down inventory values. Inventory shortages could potentially result in lost sales or
production problems in the case of the raw materials inventory of a manufacturer. To
assess which explanation is more likely, analysts can compare the company’s inventory
turnover and sales growth rate with those of the industry and review financial statement
disclosures. Slower growth combined with higher inventory turnover could indicate
inadequate inventory levels. Write-downs of inventory could reflect poor inventory
management. Minimal write-downs and sales growth rates at or above the industry’s
growth rates would support the interpretation that the higher turnover reflects greater
efficiency in managing inventory.
    A low inventory turnover ratio and a high number of days of inventory on hand
relative to industry norms could be an indicator of slow-moving or obsolete inventory.
Again, comparing the company’s sales growth across years and with the industry and
reviewing financial statement disclosures can provide additional insight.
    The gross profit margin, the ratio of gross profit to sales, indicates the percentage
of sales being contributed to net income as opposed to covering the cost of sales.
Firms in highly competitive industries generally have lower gross profit margins than
firms in industries with fewer competitors. A company’s gross profit margin may be a
function of its type of product. A company selling luxury products generally will have
higher gross profit margins than a company selling staple products. The inventory
turnover of the company selling luxury products, however, is likely to be much lower
than the inventory turnover of the company selling staple products.




5 Days of inventory on hand is also referred to as days in inventory and average inventory days outstanding.

                           solidated financial statements for Jollof Inc., a hypothetical telecommunications
                           company providing networking and communications solutions. Exhibit 4 con-
                           tains excerpts from the consolidated income statements, and Exhibit 5 contains
                           excerpts from the consolidated balance sheets. Exhibit 6 contains excerpts from
                           three of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
                               Note 1(a) discloses that Jollof ’s finished goods inventories and work in prog-
                           ress are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Note 2(a) discloses
                           that the impact of inventory and work in progress write-downs on Jollof ’s income
                           before tax was a net reduction of EUR239 million in 2017, a net reduction of
                           EUR156 million in 2016, and a net reduction of EUR65 million in 2015.6 The
                           inventory impairment loss amounts steadily increased from 2015 to 2017 and
                           are included as a component, (additions)/reversals, of Jollof ’s change in val-
                           uation allowance as disclosed in Note 3(b) from Exhibit 6. Observe also that
                           Jollof discloses its valuation allowance at 31 December 2017, 2016, and 2015 in
                           Note 3(b) and details on the allocation of the allowance are included in Note
                           3(a). The EUR549 million valuation allowance is the total of a EUR528 million
                           allowance for inventories and a EUR21 million allowance for work in progress on
                           construction contracts. Finally, observe that the EUR1,845 million net value for
                           inventories (excluding construction contracts) at 31 December 2017 in Note 3(a)
                           reconciles with the balance sheet amount for inventories and work in progress,
                           net, on 31 December 2017, as presented in Exhibit 5.
                               The inventory valuation allowance represents the total amount of inventory
                           write-downs taken for the inventory reported on the balance sheet (which is
                           measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value). Therefore, an analyst can
                           determine the historical cost of the company’s inventory by adding the inventory
                           valuation allowance to the reported inventory carrying amount on the balance
                           sheet. The valuation allowance increased in magnitude and as a percentage of
                           gross inventory values from 2015 to 2017.

                           in progress are calculated based on an analysis of foreseeable changes
                           in demand, technology, or the market, in order to determine obsolete or
                           excess inventories and work in progress.
                               The valuation allowances are accounted for in cost of sales or in
                           restructuring costs, depending on the nature of the amounts concerned.

   1. Calculate Jollof ’s inventory turnover, number of days of inventory on hand,
      gross profit margin, current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and return on total
      assets for 2017 and 2016 based on the numbers reported. Use an average
      for inventory and total asset amounts and year-end numbers for other ratio
      items. For debt, include only bonds and notes issued, long-term; other long-

      Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of sales ÷ Average inventory
      2017 inventory turnover ratio = 5.05 = 9,400 ÷ [(1,845 + 1,877) ÷ 2]

      2016 inventory turnover ratio = 5.38 = 10,150 ÷ [(1,877 + 1,898) ÷ 2]
      Number of days of inventory = 365 days ÷ Inventory turnover ratio
      2017 number of days of inventory = 72.3 days = 365 days ÷ 5.05

      2016 number of days of inventory = 67.8 days = 365 days ÷ 5.38
      Gross profit margin = Gross profit ÷ Total revenue
      2017 gross profit margin = 34.1% = 4,867 ÷ 14,267

      2016 gross profit margin = 32.1% = 4,795 ÷ 14,945
      Current ratio = Current assets ÷ Current liabilities
      2017 current ratio = 1.25 = 12,238 ÷ 9,817

      2016 current ratio = 1.26 = 11,504 ÷ 9,117
      Debt-to-equity ratio = Total debt ÷ Total shareholders’ equity

      2016 debt-to-equity ratio = 0.43 = (3,794 + 40 + 406) ÷ 9,830

                          2. Based on the answer to question 1, comment on the changes from 2016 to
                             2017.
                            Solution:
                            From 2016 to 2017, the inventory turnover ratio declined and the number of
                            days of inventory increased by 4.5 days. Jollof appears to be managing inven-
                            tory less efficiently. The gross profit margin improved by 2.0 percent, from
                            32.1 percent in 2016 to 34.1 percent in 2017. The current ratio is relatively
                            unchanged from 2016 to 2017. The debt-to-equity ratio has risen significant-
                            ly in 2017 compared to 2016. Although Jollof ’s total debt has been relatively
                            stable during this time period, the company’s equity has been declining rap-
                            idly because of the cumulative effect of its net losses on retained earnings.
                            The return on assets is negative and deteriorated in 2017 compared to 2016.
                            A larger net loss and lower total assets in 2017 resulted in a higher negative
                            return on assets. The analyst should investigate the underlying reasons for
                            the sharp decline in Jollof ’s return on assets. From Exhibit 4, it is apparent
                            that Jollof ’s gross profit margins were insufficient to cover the administrative
                            and selling expenses and research and development costs in 2016 and 2017.
                            Large restructuring costs and asset impairment losses contributed to the
                            loss from operating activities in both 2016 and 2017.

                          3. If Jollof had used the weighted average cost method instead of the FIFO
                             method during 2017, 2016, and 2015, what would be the effect on Jollof ’s
                             reported cost of sales and inventory carrying amounts? What would be the
                             directional impact on the financial ratios that were calculated for Jollof in
                             Question 1?
                            Solution:
                            If inventory replacement costs were increasing during 2015, 2016, and 2017
                            (and inventory quantity levels were stable or increasing), Jollof ’s cost of sales
                            would have been higher and its gross profit margin would have been lower
                            under the weighted average cost inventory method than what was reported
                            under the FIFO method (assuming no inventory write-downs that otherwise
                            would neutralize the differences between the inventory valuation meth-
                            ods). FIFO allocates the oldest inventory costs to cost of sales; the reported
                            cost of sales would be lower under FIFO given increasing inventory costs.
                            Inventory carrying amounts would be higher under the FIFO method than
                            under the weighted average cost method because the more recently pur-
                            chased inventory items would be included in inventory at their higher costs
                            (again assuming no inventory write-downs that otherwise would neutralize
                            the differences between the inventory valuation methods). Consequently,
                            Jollof ’s reported gross profit, net income, and retained earnings would also
                            be higher for those years under the FIFO method.
                            The effects on ratios are as follows:

                             ■   The inventory turnover ratios would all be higher under the weighted
                                 average cost method because the numerator (cost of sales) would be
                                 higher and the denominator (inventory) would be lower than what was
                                 reported by Jollof under the FIFO method.
                             ■   The number of days of inventory would be lower under the weighted
                                 average cost method because the inventory turnover ratios would be
                                 higher.
                             ■   The gross profit margin ratios would all be lower under the weighted
                                 average cost method because cost of sales would be higher under the
                                 weighted average cost method than under the FIFO method.
Presentation and Disclosure                                                           191


      ■   The current ratios would all be lower under the weighted average cost
          method because inventory carrying values would be lower than under
          the FIFO method (current liabilities would be the same under both
          methods).
      ■   The return-on-assets ratios would all be lower under the weighted
          average cost method because the incremental profit added to the
          numerator (net income) has a greater impact than the incremental
          increase to the denominator (total assets). By way of example, assume
          that a company has EUR3 million in net income and EUR100 million
          in total assets using the weighted average cost method. If the company
          reports another EUR1 million in net income by using FIFO instead of
          weighted average cost, it would then also report an additional EUR1
          million in total assets (after tax). Based on this example, the return on
          assets is 3.00 percent (EUR3/EUR100) under the weighted average cost
          method and 3.96 percent (EUR4/EUR101) under the FIFO method.
      ■   The debt-to-equity ratios would all be higher under the weighted
          average cost method because retained earnings would be lower than
          under the FIFO method (again assuming no inventory write-downs
          that otherwise would neutralize the differences between the inventory
          valuation methods).
      ■   Conversely, if inventory replacement costs were decreasing during
          2015, 2016, and 2017 (and inventory quantity levels were stable or
          increasing), Jollof ’s cost of sales would have been lower and its gross
          profit and inventory would have been higher under the weighted
          average cost method than were reported under the FIFO method
          (assuming no inventory write-downs that otherwise would neutralize
          the differences between the inventory valuation methods). As a result,
          the ratio assessment that was performed above would result in directly
          opposite conclusions.

                          1. Carrying inventory at a value above its historical cost would most likely be per-
                             mitted if:
                             A. the inventory was held by a producer of agricultural products.

                             B. financial statements were prepared using US GAAP.

                             C. the change resulted from a reversal of a previous write-down.

                             lectible item, and the inventory is now worth an estimated GBP3 million. The
                             inventory is most likely reported on the balance sheet at:
                             A. GBP550,000.

                             realizable value is higher than the value when written down. Fernando’s inventory
                             balance will most likely be:
                             A. higher if it complies with IFRS.

                             B. higher if it complies with US GAAP.

                             C. the same under US GAAP and IFRS.

                          4. A write-down of the value of inventory to its net realizable value will have a posi-

   A. current ratio was too high.

   B. gross margin was too high.

   C. inventory turnover was too high.

10. Zimt AG wrote down the value of its inventory in 2017 and reversed the
    write-down in 2018. Compared to the results the company would have reported
    if the write-down had never occurred, Zimt’s reported that the 2018:
   A. profit was overstated.

   B. cash flow from operations was overstated.

   C. year-end inventory balance was overstated.

11. Compared to a company that uses the FIFO method, during periods of rising
    prices a company that uses the LIFO method will most likely appear more:
   A. liquid.

   B. efficient.

   C. profitable.

12. Nutmeg, Inc. uses the LIFO method to account for inventory. During years in
    which inventory unit costs are generally rising and in which the company pur-
    chases more inventory than it sells to customers, its reported gross profit margin
    will most likely be:
   A. lower than it would be if the company used the FIFO method.

   B. higher than it would be if the company used the FIFO method.

   C. about the same as it would be if the company used the FIFO method.

                          13. Compared to using the FIFO method to account for inventory, during periods of
                              rising prices, a company using the LIFO method is most likely to report higher:
                             A. net income.

                             B. cost of sales.

                             C. income taxes.

                          14. Carey Company reports under US GAAP, whereas Jonathan Company reports
                              under IFRS. It is least likely that:
                             A. Carey has reversed an inventory write-down.

                             B. Jonathan has reversed an inventory write-down.

                             C. Jonathan and Carey both use the FIFO inventory accounting method.



                          The following information relates to questions
                          15-21
                             Hans Annan, CFA, a food and beverage analyst, is reviewing Century Chocolate’s
                             inventory policies as part of his evaluation of the company. Century Chocolate,
                             based in Switzerland, manufactures chocolate products and purchases and resells
                             other confectionery products to complement its chocolate line. Annan visit-
                             ed Century Chocolate’s manufacturing facility last year. He learned that cacao
                             beans, imported from Brazil, represent the most significant raw material and
                             that the work-in-progress inventory consists primarily of three items: roasted
                             cacao beans, a thick paste produced from the beans (called chocolate liquor),
                             and a sweetened mixture that needs to be “conched” to produce chocolate. On
                             the tour, Annan learned that the conching process ranges from a few hours for
                             lower-quality products to six days for the highest-quality chocolates. While there,
                             Annan saw the facility’s climate-controlled area where manufactured finished
                             products (cocoa and chocolate) and purchased finished goods are stored prior to
                             shipment to customers. After touring the facility, Annan had a discussion with
                             Century Chocolate’s CFO regarding the types of costs that were included in each
                             inventory category.
                             Annan has asked his assistant, Joanna Kern, to gather some preliminary informa-
                             tion regarding Century Chocolate’s financial statements and inventories. He also
                             asked Kern to calculate the inventory turnover ratios for Century Chocolate and
                             another chocolate manufacturer for the most recent five years. Annan does not
                             know Century Chocolate’s most direct competitor, so he asks Kern to do some
                             research and select the most appropriate company for the ratio comparison.
                             Kern reports back that Century Chocolate prepares its financial statements in
                             accordance with IFRS. She tells Annan that the policy footnote states that raw
                             materials and purchased finished goods are valued at purchase cost, whereas
                             work in progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production cost.
                             Raw material inventories and purchased finished goods are accounted for using
                             the FIFO method, and the weighted average cost method is used for other inven-
                             tories. An allowance is established when the net realizable value of any inventory
                             item is lower than the value calculated previously.
                             Kern provides Annan with the selected financial statements and inventory data
                             for Century Chocolate. The ratio exhibit Kern prepared compares Century Choc-
                             olate’s inventory turnover ratios to those of Gordon’s Goodies, a US-based com-
Practice Problems                                                                          195


    pany. Annan returns the exhibit and tells Kern to select a different competitor
    that reports using IFRS rather than US GAAP. During this initial review, Annan
    asks Kern why she has not indicated whether Century Chocolate uses a perpetual
    or a periodic inventory system. Kern replies that she learned that Century Choc-
    olate uses a perpetual system but did not include this information in her report
    because inventory values would be the same under either a perpetual or periodic
    inventory system. Annan tells Kern she is wrong and directs her to research the
    matter.
    While Kern is revising her analysis, Annan reviews the most recent month’s
    Cocoa Market Review from the International Cocoa Organization. He is drawn
    to the statement that “the ICCO daily price, averaging prices in both futures
    markets, reached a 29-year high in US dollar terms and a 23-year high in special
    drawing rights (SDRs) terms (the SDR unit comprises a basket of major curren-
    cies used in international trade: US dollar, euro, pound sterling, and yen).” Annan
    makes a note that he will need to factor the potential continuation of this trend
    into his analysis.

                          Ending inventory at 31 December (kilograms)                     77,750           92,560
                          Cost per unit (Swiss francs)                                      4.05             4.05

                          15. The costs least likely to be included by the CFO as inventory are:
                              A. storage costs for the chocolate liquor.

                              B. excise taxes paid to the government of Brazil for the cacao beans.

                              C. storage costs for chocolate and purchased finished goods awaiting shipment
                                 to customers.

                          16. What is the most likely justification for Century Chocolate’s choice of inventory
                              valuation method for its purchased finished goods?
                              A. It is the preferred method under IFRS.

                              B. It allocates the same per unit cost to both cost of sales and inventory.
Practice Problems                                                                             197


   C. Ending inventory reflects the cost of goods purchased most recently.

17. In Kern’s comparative ratio analysis, the 2018 inventory turnover ratio for Centu-
    ry Chocolate is closest to:
   A. 5.07.

   B. 5.42.

   C. 5.55.

18. The most accurate statement regarding Annan’s reasoning for requiring Kern
    to select a competitor that reports under IFRS for comparative purposes is that
    under US GAAP:
   A. fair values are used to value inventory.

   B. the LIFO method is permitted to value inventory.

   C. the specific identification method is permitted to value inventory.

19. Annan’s statement regarding the perpetual and periodic inventory systems is
    most significant when which of the following costing systems is used?
   A. LIFO

   B. FIFO

   C. Specific identification

20. Ignoring any tax effect, the change in net realizable value of the black licorice jelly
    beans from 2017 to 2018 will most likely result in:
   A. an increase in gross profit of CHF7,775.

   B. an increase in gross profit of CHF11,670.

   C. no impact on cost of sales because under IFRS, write-downs cannot be
      reversed.

21. If the trend noted in the ICCO report continues and Century Chocolate plans to
    maintain constant or increasing inventory quantities, the most likely impact on
    Century Chocolate’s financial statements related to its raw materials inventory
    will be:

* This does not match the change in the inventory valuation allowance because the valuation allowance is
reduced to reflect the valuation allowance attached to items sold and increased for additional necessary
write-downs.

    To compare the financial performance of the three companies, Groff decides to
    convert LIFO figures into FIFO figures, and adjust figures to assume no valuation
    allowance is recognized by any company.

24. Compared with its unadjusted debt-to-equity ratio, Mikko’s debt-to-equity ratio
    as of 31 December 2018, after the adjustments suggested by Groff, is:
    A. lower.

    B. higher.

    C. the same.

    industry?
    A. Crux.

    B. Rolby.

    C. Mikko.

26. Would Rolby’s valuation method show a higher gross profit margin than Crux’s
    under an inflationary, a deflationary, or a stable price scenario?

                           Cost reduction efforts were offset by increased prices of raw materials, other production
                           materials and parts. Inventories decreased during fiscal 2018 by JPY122.1 billion, or 20.1
                           percent, to JPY486.5 billion. This reflects the impacts of decreased sales volumes and fluctu-

                           from other manufacturers in the respective markets in which it operates. Competition has
                           intensified due to the worldwide deterioration in economic conditions. In addition, compe-
                           tition is likely to further intensify because of continuing globalization, possibly resulting in
                           industry reorganization. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features,

                           2.         Summary             of           significant          accounting            policies:
                           Inventories. Inventories are valued at cost, not in excess of market. Cost is determined on
                           the “average-cost” basis, except for the cost of finished products carried by certain subsidiary
                           companies, which is determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Inventories valued on
                           the LIFO basis totaled JPY94,578 million and JPY50,037 million at 31 December 2017 and
                           2018, respectively. Had the FIFO basis been used for those companies using the LIFO basis,
                           inventories would have been JPY10,120 million and JPY19,660 million higher than reported
                           at 31 December 2017 and 2018, respectively.

                          28. The management discussion and analysis (MD&A) indicated that the prices of
                              raw material, other production materials, and parts increased. Based on the
                              inventory valuation methods described in Note 2, which inventory classification
                              would least accurately reflect current prices?
                              A. Raw materials

                              B. Finished goods

29. According to Exhibit 2, the 2018 Annual Report, if the company had used the
    FIFO inventory valuation method instead of the LIFO inventory valuation meth-
    od for a portion of its inventory, the 2017 inventory value would be closest to:
   A. JPY104,698 million.

   B. JPY506,125 million.

   C. JPY618,692 million.

30. If ZP had prepared its financial statement in accordance with IFRS, the inventory
    turnover ratio (using average inventory) for 2018 would be:
   A. lower.

   B. higher.

   C. the same.

31. Inventory levels decreased from 2017 to 2018 for all of the following reasons
    except:
   A. LIFO liquidation.

   B. decreased sales volume.

   C. fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates.

32. Which observation is most likely a result of looking only at the information re-
    ported in Exhibit 2, Note 9?
   A. Increased competition has led to lower unit sales.

   B. There have been significant price increases in supplies.

   C. Management expects a further downturn in sales during 2019.

33. Exhibit 2, Note 2, indicates that “inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled
    JPY94,578 million and JPY50,037 million at 31 December 2017 and 2018, respec-
    tively.” Based on this, the LIFO reserve should most likely:
   A. increase.

   B. decrease.

   C. remain the same.

34. In Exhibit 2, the Industry and Business Risk excerpt states that, “Increased com-
    petition may lead to lower unit sales and excess production capacity and excess
    inventory. This may result in a further downward price pressure.” The downward
    price pressure could lead to inventory that is valued above current market prices
    or net realizable value. Any write-downs of inventory are least likely to have a
    significant effect on the inventory valued using:
   A. weighted average cost.

   B. first-in, first-out (FIFO).

   C. last-in, first-out (LIFO).

35. During periods of rising inventory unit costs, a company using the FIFO method
204   Learning Module 6                                                                    Analysis of Inventories


                             rather than the LIFO method will report a lower:
                             A. current ratio.

                             B. inventory turnover.

                             C. gross profit margin.

                          36. Compared with a company that uses the FIFO method, during a period of rising
                              unit inventory costs, a company using the LIFO method will most likely appear
                              more:
                             A. liquid.

                             B. efficient.

                             C. profitable.

                             A. LIFO

                             B. FIFO

   SOLUTIONS
1. A is correct. IFRS allow the inventories of producers and dealers of agricultural
   and forest products, agricultural produce after harvest, and minerals and mineral
   products to be carried at net realizable value even if above historical cost. (US
   GAAP treatment is similar.)

2. B is correct. Under IFRS, the reversal of write-downs is required if net real-
   izable value increases. The inventory will be reported on the balance sheet at
   GBP1,000,000. The inventory is reported at the lower of cost or net realizable
   value.

3. A is correct. IFRS requires the reversal of inventory write-downs if net realizable
   values increase; US GAAP does not permit the reversal of write-downs. There-
   fore, Fernando’s inventory balance would be higher under IFRS.

4. C is correct. Activity ratios (e.g., inventory turnover and total asset turnover) will
   be positively affected by a write-down to net realizable value because the asset
   base (denominator) is reduced. On the balance sheet, the inventory carrying
   amount is written down to its net realizable value and the loss in value (expense)
   is generally reflected on the income statement in the cost of goods sold, thus
   reducing gross profit, operating profit, and net income.

5. A is correct. Zimt uses the FIFO method, so its cost of sales represents units
   purchased at a (no longer available) lower price. Nutmeg uses the LIFO meth-
   od, so its cost of sales is approximately equal to the current replacement cost of
   inventory.

6. B is correct. Nutmeg uses the LIFO method, and thus some of the inventory on
   the balance sheet was purchased at a (no longer available) lower price. Zimt uses
   the FIFO method, so the carrying value on the balance sheet represents the most
   recently purchased units and thus approximates the current replacement cost.

7. B is correct. In a declining price environment, the newest inventory is the
   lowest-cost inventory. In such circumstances, using the LIFO method (selling the
   newer, cheaper inventory first) will result in lower cost of sales and higher profit.

8. B is correct. In a rising price environment, inventory balances will be higher for
   the company using the FIFO method. Accounts payable are based on amounts
   due to suppliers, not the amounts accrued based on inventory accounting.

9. C is correct. The write-down reduced the value of inventory and increased cost
   of sales in 2017. The higher numerator and lower denominator mean that the
   inventory turnover ratio as reported was too high. Gross margin and the current
   ratio were both too low.

10. A is correct. The reversal of the write-down shifted the cost of sales from 2018 to
    2017. The 2017 cost of sales was higher because of the write-down, and the 2018
    cost of sales was lower because of the reversal of the write-down. As a result,
    the reported 2018 profits were overstated. Inventory balance in 2018 is the same
    because the write-down and reversal cancel each other out. Cash flow from oper-
    ations is not affected by the non-cash write-down, but the higher profits in 2018
    likely resulted in higher taxes and thus lower cash flow from operations.

11. B is correct. LIFO will result in lower inventory and higher cost of sales. Gross
    margin (a profitability ratio) will be lower, the current ratio (a liquidity ratio) will
206   Learning Module 6                                                                      Analysis of Inventories


                             be lower, and inventory turnover (an efficiency ratio) will be higher.

                          12. A is correct. LIFO will result in lower inventory and higher cost of sales in
                              periods of rising costs compared to FIFO. Consequently, LIFO results in a lower
                              gross profit margin than FIFO.

                          13. B is correct. During periods of rising prices, using the LIFO method increases
                              cost of sales relative to the FIFO method, thus reducing profits and the taxes
                              thereon.

                          14. A is correct. US GAAP does not permit inventory write-downs to be reversed.

                          15. C is correct. The storage costs for inventory awaiting shipment to customers are
                              not costs of purchase, costs of conversion, or other costs incurred in bringing
                              the inventories to their present location and condition and are not included in
                              inventory. The storage costs for the chocolate liquor occur during the production
                              process and are thus part of the conversion costs. Excise taxes are part of the
                              purchase cost.

                          16. C is correct. The carrying amount of inventories under FIFO will more closely
                              reflect current replacement values because inventories are assumed to consist
                              of the most recently purchased items. FIFO is an acceptable, but not preferred,
                              method under IFRS. Weighted average cost, not FIFO, is the cost formula that
                              allocates the same per unit cost to both cost of sales and inventory.

                          17. B is correct. Inventory turnover = Cost of sales/Average inventory =
                              41,043/7,569.5 = 5.42. Average inventory is (8,100 + 7,039)/2 = 7,569.5.

                          18. B is correct. For comparative purposes, the choice of a competitor that reports
                              under IFRS is requested because LIFO is permitted under US GAAP.

                          19. A is correct. The carrying amount of the ending inventory may differ because the
                              perpetual system will apply LIFO continuously throughout the year, liquidating
                              layers as sales are made. Under the periodic system, the sales will start from the
                              last layer in the year. Under FIFO, the sales will occur from the same layers re-
                              gardless of whether a perpetual or periodic system is used. Specific identification
                              identifies the actual products sold and remaining in inventory, and there will be
                              no difference under a perpetual or periodic system.

                          20. A is correct. Gross profit will most likely increase by CHF7,775. The net realiz-
                              able value has increased and now exceeds the cost. The write-down from 2017
                              can be reversed. The write-down in 2017 was 9,256 [92,560 × (4.05 – 3.95)].
                              IFRS require the reversal of any write-downs for a subsequent increase in value
                              of inventory previously written down. The reversal is limited to the lower of the
                              subsequent increase or the original write-down. Only 77,750 kilograms remain
                              in inventory; the reversal is 77,750 × (4.05 – 3.95) = 7,775. The amount of any re-
                              versal of a write-down is recognized as a reduction in cost of sales. This reduction
                              results in an increase in gross profit.

                          21. C is correct. Using the FIFO method to value inventories when prices are rising
                              will allocate more of the cost of goods available for sale to ending inventories
                              (the most recent purchases, which are at higher costs, are assumed to remain in
                              inventory) and less to cost of sales (the oldest purchases, which are at lower costs,
                              are assumed to be sold first).

                          22. B is correct. Crux’s adjusted inventory turnover ratio must be computed using
                              cost of goods sold (COGS) under FIFO and excluding charges for increases in
                              valuation allowances.
Solutions                                                                              207


   COGS (adjusted)
   = COGS (LIFO method) – Charges included in cost of goods sold for inventory
   write-downs – Change in LIFO reserve

   = USD3,120 million – 13 million – (55 million – 72 million)

   = USD3,124 million
   Note: Minus the change in LIFO reserve is equivalent to plus the decrease in
   LIFO reserve. The adjusted inventory turnover ratio is computed using average
   inventory under FIFO.
   Ending inventory (FIFO) = Ending inventory (LIFO) + LIFO reserve

   Ending inventory 2018 (FIFO) = USD480 + 55 = USD535

   Ending inventory 2017 (FIFO) = USD465 + 72 = USD537

   Average inventory = (USD535 + 537)/2 = USD536
   Therefore, adjusted inventory turnover ratio equals:
   Inventory turnover ratio = COGS/Average inventory = USD3,124/USD536 = 5.83

23. B is correct. Rolby’s adjusted net profit margin must be computed using net
    income (NI) under FIFO and excluding charges for increases in valuation
    allowances.
   NI (adjusted)
   = NI (FIFO method) + Charges, included in cost of goods sold for inventory
   write-downs, after tax

   = USD327 million + 15 million × (1 – 30%)

   = USD337.5 million
   Therefore, adjusted net profit margin equals:
   Net profit margin = NI/Revenues = USD337.5/USD5,442 = 6.20%.

24. A is correct. Mikko’s adjusted debt-to-equity ratio is lower because the debt
    (numerator) is unchanged and the adjusted shareholders’ equity (denominator)
    is higher. The adjusted shareholders’ equity corresponds to shareholders’ equity
    under FIFO, excluding charges for increases in valuation allowances. Therefore,
    adjusted shareholders’ equity is higher than reported (unadjusted) shareholders’
    equity.

25. C is correct. Mikko’s and Crux’s gross margin ratios would better reflect the
    current gross margin of the industry than Rolby because both use LIFO. LIFO
    recognizes as cost of goods sold the cost of the most recently purchased units;
    therefore, it better reflects replacement cost. However, Mikko’s gross margin
    ratio best reflects the current gross margin of the industry because Crux’s LIFO
    reserve is decreasing. This could reflect a LIFO liquidation by Crux which would
    distort gross profit margin.

26. B is correct. The FIFO method shows a higher gross profit margin than the LIFO
    method in an inflationary scenario, because FIFO allocates to cost of goods sold
    the cost of the oldest units available for sale. In an inflationary environment,
    these units are the ones with the lowest cost.

                          27. A is correct. An inventory write-down increases the cost of sales and reduces
                              profit and reduces the carrying value of inventory and assets. This has a negative
                              effect on profitability and solvency ratios. However, activity ratios appear pos-
                              itively affected by a write-down because the asset base, whether total assets or
                              inventory (denominator), is reduced. The numerator, sales, in total asset turnover
                              is unchanged, and the numerator, cost of sales, in inventory turnover is increased.
                              Thus, turnover ratios are higher and appear more favorable as the result of the
                              write-down.

                          28. B is correct. Finished goods least accurately reflect current prices because some
                              of the finished goods are valued under the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) basis. The
                              costs of the newest units available for sale are allocated to cost of goods sold,
                              leaving the oldest units (at lower costs) in inventory. ZP values raw materials and
                              work in process using the weighted average cost method. While not fully re-
                              flecting current prices, some inflationary effect will be included in the inventory
                              values.

                          29. C is correct. FIFO inventory = Reported inventory + LIFO reserve = JPY608,572
                              + 10,120 = JPY618,692. The LIFO reserve is disclosed in Note 2 of the notes to
                              consolidated financial statements.

                          30. A is correct. The inventory turnover ratio would be lower. The average inventory
                              would be higher under FIFO and cost of products sold would be lower by the
                              increase in LIFO reserve. LIFO is not permitted under IFRS.
                             Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of products sold ÷ Average inventory

                             2018 inventory turnover ratio as reported = 10.63
                             = JPY5,822,805/[(608,572 + 486,465)/2].

                             2018 inventory turnover ratio adjusted to FIFO as necessary = 10.34
                             = [JPY5,822,805 – (19,660 – 10,120)]/[(608,572 + 10,120 + 486,465 + 19,660)/2].

                          31. A is correct. No LIFO liquidation occurred during 2018; the LIFO reserve
                              increased from JPY10,120 million in 2017 to JPY19,660 million in 2018. Manage-
                              ment stated in the MD&A that the decrease in inventories reflected the impact of
                              decreased sales volumes and fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates.

                          32. C is correct. Finished goods and raw materials inventories are lower in 2018
                              when compared to 2017. Reduced levels of inventory typically indicate an antici-
                              pated business contraction.

                          33. B is correct. The decrease in LIFO inventory in 2018 would typically indicate that
                              more inventory units were sold than produced or purchased. Accordingly, one
                              would expect a liquidation of some of the older LIFO layers and the LIFO reserve
                              to decrease. In actuality, the LIFO reserve increased from JPY10,120 million in
                              2017 to JPY19,660 million in 2018. This is not to be expected and is likely caused
                              by the increase in prices of raw materials, other production materials, and parts
                              of foreign currencies as noted in the MD&A. An analyst should seek to confirm
                              this explanation.

                          34. B is correct. If prices have been decreasing, write-downs under FIFO are least
                              likely to have a significant effect because the inventory is valued at closer to the
                              new, lower prices. Typically, inventories valued using LIFO are less likely to incur
                              inventory write-downs than inventories valued using weighted average cost or
                              FIFO. Under LIFO, the oldest costs are reflected in the inventory carrying value
                              on the balance sheet. Given increasing inventory costs, the inventory carry-
Solutions                                                                                    209


   ing values under the LIFO method are already conservatively presented at the
   oldest and lowest costs. Thus, it is far less likely that inventory write-downs will
   occur under LIFO; and if a write-down does occur, it is likely to be of a lesser
   magnitude.

35. B is correct. During a period of rising inventory costs, a company using the FIFO
    method will allocate a lower amount to cost of goods sold and a higher amount
    to ending inventory as compared with the LIFO method. The inventory turnover
    ratio is the ratio of cost of sales to ending inventory. A company using the FIFO
    method will produce a lower inventory turnover ratio as compared with the LIFO
    method. The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) and the gross profit
    margin [gross profit/sales = (sales less cost of goods sold)/sales] will be higher un-
    der the FIFO method than under the LIFO method in periods of rising inventory
    unit costs.

36. B is correct. During a period of rising inventory prices, a company using the
    LIFO method will have higher cost of goods sold and a lower inventory compared
    with a company using the FIFO method. The inventory turnover ratio will be
    higher for the company using the LIFO method, thus making it appear more effi-
    cient. Current assets and gross profit margin will be lower for the company using
    the LIFO method, thus making it appear to be less liquid and less profitable.

37. B is correct. In an environment of declining inventory unit costs and constant or
    increasing inventory quantities, FIFO (in comparison with weighted average cost
    or LIFO) will have higher cost of goods sold and lower net income and inventory.
    Because both inventory and net income are lower, total equity is lower, resulting
    in a higher debt-to-equity ratio.

                                      charges reflect an unexpected decline in the fair value of an asset to an

              2           ACQUISITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

                                           compare the financial reporting of the following types of intangible
                                           assets: purchased, internally developed, and acquired in a business
                                           combination

                          Intangible assets are non-monetary assets lacking physical substance. Intangible assets
                          include items that involve exclusive rights, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks,
                          and franchises. Under IFRS, identifiable intangible assets must meet three definitional
                          criteria. They must be (1) identifiable (either capable of being separated from the entity
                          or arising from contractual or legal rights), (2) under the control of the company, and
                          (3) expected to generate future economic benefits. In addition, two recognition crite-
                          ria must be met: (1) It is probable that the expected future economic benefits of the
                          asset will flow to the company, and (2) the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
                          Goodwill, which is not considered an identifiable intangible asset,1 arises when one
                          company purchases another and the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the
                          net identifiable assets (both the tangible assets and the identifiable intangible assets,
                          minus liabilities) acquired.



                          1 The IFRS definition of an intangible asset as an “identifiable non-monetary asset without physical
                          substance” applies to intangible assets not specifically dealt with in standards other than International
                          Accounting Standards (IAS) 38. The definition of intangible assets under US GAAP—“assets (other than
                          financial assets) that lack physical substance”—includes goodwill in the definition of an intangible asset.
Acquisition of Intangible Assets                                                              213


    Accounting for an intangible asset depends on how it is acquired. The following
sections describe accounting for intangible assets obtained in three ways: purchased
in situations other than business combinations, developed internally, and acquired
in business combinations.


Intangible Assets Purchased in Situations Other Than Business
Combinations
Intangible assets purchased in situations other than business combinations, such as
buying a patent, are treated at acquisition the same as long-lived tangible assets; they
are recorded at their fair value when acquired, which is assumed to be equivalent to
the purchase price. If several intangible assets are acquired as part of a group, the
purchase price is allocated to each asset on the basis of its fair value.
    In deciding how to treat individual intangible assets for analytical purposes, analysts
are particularly aware that companies must use a substantial amount of judgment and
numerous assumptions to determine the fair value of individual intangible assets. For
analysis, therefore, understanding the types of intangible assets acquired can often
be more useful than focusing on the values assigned to the individual assets. In other
words, an analyst would typically be more interested in understanding what assets a
company acquired (e.g., franchise rights) than in the precise portion of the purchase
price a company allocated to each asset. Understanding the types of assets a company
acquires can offer insights into the company’s strategic direction and future operating
potential.


Intangible Assets Developed Internally
In contrast with the treatment of construction costs of tangible assets, the costs to
internally develop intangible assets are generally expensed when incurred. In some
situations, however, the costs incurred to internally develop an intangible asset are
capitalized. The general analytical issues related to the capitalizing-versus-expensing
decision apply here—namely, comparability across companies and the effect on an
individual company’s trend analysis.
    The general requirement that costs to internally develop intangible assets be
expensed should be compared with capitalizing the cost of acquiring intangible assets
in situations other than business combinations. Because costs associated with internally
developing intangible assets are usually expensed, a company that has internally devel-
oped intangible assets, such as patents, copyrights, or brands through expenditures on
R&D or advertising, will recognize a lower amount of assets than a company that has
obtained intangible assets through external purchase. In addition, on the statement of
cash flows, costs of internally developing intangible assets are classified as operating
cash outflows whereas costs of acquiring intangible assets are classified as investing
cash outflows. Differences in strategy (developing versus acquiring intangible assets)
can thus impact financial ratios.
    IFRS requires that expenditures on research (or during the research phase of an
internal project) be expensed rather than capitalized as an intangible asset.2 Research
is defined as “original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of
gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.”3 The “research
phase of an internal project” refers to the period during which a company cannot
demonstrate that an intangible asset is being created—for example, the search for
alternative materials or systems to use in a production process. In contrast with the

                          treatment of research-phase expenditures, IFRS allow companies to recognize an
                          intangible asset arising from development expenditures (or the development phase
                          of an internal project) if certain criteria are met, including a demonstration of the
                          technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset and the intent to use or sell
                          the asset. Development is defined as “the application of research findings or other
                          knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved
                          materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of com-
                          mercial production or use.”4
                              Generally, US GAAP requires that both research and development costs be
                          expensed as incurred but require capitalization of certain costs related to software
                          development.5 Costs incurred to develop a software product for sale are expensed
                          until the product’s technological feasibility is established and are capitalized thereafter.
                          Similarly, companies expense costs related to the development of software for internal
                          use until it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be
                          used as intended. Thereafter, development costs are capitalized. The probability that
                          the project will be completed is easier to demonstrate than is technological feasibility.
                          The capitalized costs, related directly to developing software for sale or internal use,
                          include the costs of employees who help build and test the software. The treatment
                          of software development costs under US GAAP is similar to the treatment of all costs
                          of internally developed intangible assets under IFRS.

                             Software Development Costs
                             REH AG, a fictional company that reports under IFRS, incurs expenditures of
                             EUR1,000 per month during the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019 to develop
                             software for internal use.

                             1. 1. What is the accounting impact of the company being able to demonstrate
                                that the software met the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset on 1
                                February versus 1 December?
                                Solution:
                                If the company is able to demonstrate that the software met the criteria
                                for recognition as an intangible asset on 1 February, the company would
                                recognize the EUR1,000 expended in January as an expense on the income
                                statement for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019. The other EUR11,000
                                of expenditures would be recognized as an intangible asset (on the balance
                                sheet). Alternatively, if the company is not able to demonstrate that the soft-
                                ware met the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset until 1 December,
                                the company would recognize the EUR11,000 expensed in January through
                                November as an expense on the income statement for the fiscal year ended
                                31 December 2019, with the other EUR1,000 of expenditures recognized as
                                an intangible asset.

   2. 2. How would the treatment of expenditures differ if the company reported
      under US GAAP and it had established in 2018 that the project was likely to
      be completed and the software used to perform the function intended?
       Solution:
       Under US GAAP, the company would capitalize the entire EUR12,000 spent
       to develop software for internal use.



Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination
When one company acquires another company, the transaction is accounted for using
the acquisition method of accounting.6 Under the acquisition method, the company
identified as the acquirer allocates the purchase price to each asset acquired (and each
liability assumed) on the basis of its fair value. If the purchase price exceeds the sum
of the amounts that can be allocated to individual identifiable assets and liabilities,
the excess is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill cannot be identified separately from the
business as a whole.
     Under IFRS, the acquired individual assets include identifiable intangible assets that
meet the definitional and recognition criteria.7 Otherwise, if the item is acquired in a
business combination and cannot be recognized as a tangible or identifiable intangible
asset, it is recognized as goodwill. Under US GAAP, there are two criteria to judge
whether an intangible asset acquired in a business combination should be recognized
separately from goodwill: The asset must be either an item arising from contractual or
legal rights or an item that can be separated from the acquired company. Examples of
intangible assets treated separately from goodwill include the intangible assets previ-
ously mentioned that involve exclusive rights (patents, copyrights, franchises, licenses),
as well as such items as internet domain names and video and audiovisual materials.
     Exhibit 1 describes how AB InBev allocated the USD103 billion purchase con-
sideration in its 2016 acquisition of SABMiller Group. The combined company was
renamed Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV. The majority of the intangible asset valuation
relates to brands with indefinite life (USD19.9 billion of the USD20.0 billion total). Of
USD63.0 billion total assets acquired, assets to be divested were valued at USD24.8
billion and assets to be held for were valued at USD38.2 billion. In total, intangible
assets represent 52 percent of the total assets to be held for use. In addition, USD74.1
billion of goodwill was recognized in the transaction.

         sionally allocated primarily to the businesses in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
         Australia, South Africa and other African, Asia Pacific and Latin American
         countries. The factors that contributed to the recognition of goodwill
         include the acquisition of an assembled workforce and the premiums paid

nations (IFRS 3 and FASB ASC, Section 805).

future benefits. The recognition criteria are probable flows of the expected economic benefits to the com-

                                  assessment of the future economic benefits supporting recognition of this
                                  goodwill is in part based on expected savings through the implementation
                                  of AB InBev best practices such as, among others, a zero based budgeting
                                  program and initiatives that are expected to bring greater efficiency and
                                  standardization, generate cost savings and maximize purchasing power.
                                  Goodwill also arises due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in
                                  relation to the preliminary fair value adjustments on acquired intangible
                                  assets for which the amortization does not qualify as a tax deductible
                                  expense. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes.
                                      “The majority of the intangible asset valuation relates to brands with
                                  indefinite life, valued for a total amount of 19.9 billion US dollar. The
                                  valuation of the brands with indefinite life is based on a series of factors,
                                  including the brand history, the operating plan and the countries in which
                                  the brands are sold. The fair value of brands was estimated by applying a
                                  combination of known valuation methodologies, such as the royalty relief
                                  and excess earnings valuation approaches.

IMPAIRMENT AND DERECOGNITION OF ASSETS
                                                                                            3
              explain and evaluate how impairment and derecognition of property,
              plant, and equipment and intangible assets affect the financial
              statements and ratios

In contrast with depreciation and amortization charges, which serve to allocate the
depreciable cost of a long-lived asset over its useful life, impairment charges reflect
an unanticipated decline in the value of an asset. Both IFRS and US GAAP require
companies to write down the carrying amount of impaired assets. Impairment reversals
for identifiable, long-lived assets are permitted under IFRS but typically not under
US GAAP.
    An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount. Although IFRS and US GAAP define recoverability differently
(as described below), in general, impairment losses are recognized when the asset’s
carrying amount is not recoverable. The following paragraphs describe accounting
for impairment for different categories of assets.


Impairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment
Accounting standards do not require that property, plant, and equipment be tested
annually for impairment. Rather, at the end of each reporting period (generally, a fiscal
year), a company assesses whether there are indications of asset impairment. If there
is no indication of impairment, the asset is not tested for impairment. If there is an
indication of impairment, such as evidence of obsolescence, decline in demand for
products, or technological advancements, the recoverable amount of the asset should
be measured in order to test for impairment. For property, plant, and equipment,
impairment losses are recognized when the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable
(i.e. the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount). The amount of the
impairment loss will reduce the carrying amount of the asset on the balance sheet and
will reduce net income on the income statement. The impairment loss is a non-cash
item and will not affect cash from operations.
     IFRS and US GAAP differ somewhat both in the guidelines for determining that
impairment has occurred and in the measurement of an impairment loss. Under
IAS 36, an impairment loss is measured as the excess of carrying amount over the
recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount of an asset is defined as
“the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.” Value in use is
based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Under US GAAP, assessing
recoverability is separate from measuring the impairment loss. The carrying amount
of an asset “group” is considered not recoverable when it exceeds the undiscounted
expected future cash flows of the group. If the asset’s carrying amount is considered
not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s
fair value and carrying amount.

                            1. Under IFRS, what would the company report for the machine?
                               Solution:
                               Under IFRS, the company would compare the carrying amount (GBP18,000)
                               with the higher of its fair value less costs to sell (GBP15,000) and its value in
                               use (GBP16,000). The carrying amount exceeds the value in use, the higher
                               of the two amounts, by GBP2,000. The machine would be written down to
                               the recoverable amount of £16,000, and a loss of £2,000 would be report-
                               ed in the income statement. The carrying amount of the machine is now
                               GBP16,000. A new depreciation schedule based on the carrying amount of
                               GBP16,000 would be developed.

                            2. Under US GAAP, what would the company report for the machine?
                               Solution:
                               Under US GAAP, the carrying amount (GBP18,000) is compared with the
                               undiscounted expected future cash flows (GBP19,000). The carrying amount
                               is less than the undiscounted expected future cash flows, so the carrying
                               amount is considered recoverable. The machine would continue to be car-
                               ried at GBP18,000, and no loss would be reported.

                             In Example 2, a write down in the value of a piece of property, plant, and equipment
                          occurred under IFRS but not under US GAAP. In Example 3, a write down occurs
                          under both IFRS and US GAAP.

                            Impairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment
                            Essex, a fictional manufacturing company in the United Kingdom, owns a machine
                            it uses to produce a single product. The demand for the product has declined
                            substantially since the introduction of a competing product. The company has
                            assembled the following information with respect to the machine:
                                                                        ​




                              Carrying amount                                           GBP18,000
                              Undiscounted expected future cash flows                   GBP16,000
                              Present value of expected future cash flows               GBP14,000
                              Fair value if sold                                        GBP10,000
                              Costs to sell                                             GBP2,000
                                                                        ​




                            1. Under IFRS, what would the company report for the machine?
                               Solution:
                               Under IFRS, the company would compare the carrying amount (GBP18,000)
                               with the higher of its fair value less costs to sell (GBP8,000) and its value in
                               use (GBP14,000). The carrying amount exceeds the value in use, the higher

      of the two amounts, by GBP4,000. The machine would be written down to
      the recoverable amount of GBP14,000, and a loss of GBP4,000 would be re-
      ported in the income statement. The carrying amount of the machine is now
      GBP14,000. A new depreciation schedule based on the carrying amount of
      GBP14,000 would be developed.

   2. Under US GAAP, what would the company report for the machine?
      Solution:
      Under US GAAP, the carrying amount (GBP18,000) is compared with the
      undiscounted expected future cash flows (GBP16,000). The carrying amount
      exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows, so the carrying
      amount is considered not recoverable. The machine would be written down
      to fair value of GBP10,000, and a loss of GBP8,000 would be reported in the
      income statement. The carrying amount of the machine is now GBP10,000.
      A new depreciation schedule based on the carrying amount of GBP10,000
      would be developed.

    Example 3 shows that the write down to value in use under IFRS can be less than
the write down to fair value under US GAAP. The difference in recognition of impair-
ment losses is ultimately reflected in differences in book value of equity.


Impairment of Intangible Assets with a Finite Life
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized (carrying amount decreases over
time) and may become impaired. As is the case with property, plant, and equipment,
the assets are not tested annually for impairment. Instead, they are tested only when
significant events suggest the need to test. The company assesses at the end of each
reporting period whether a significant event suggesting the need to test for impairment
has occurred. Examples of such events include a significant decrease in the market price
or a significant adverse change in legal or economic factors. Impairment accounting
for intangible assets with a finite life is essentially the same as for tangible assets; the
amount of the impairment loss will reduce the carrying amount of the asset on the
balance sheet and will reduce net income on the income statement.


Impairment of Intangibles with Indefinite Lives
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Instead, they are carried on
the balance sheet at historical cost but are tested at least annually for impairment.
Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale
A long-lived (non-current) asset is reclassified as held for sale rather than held for use
when management’s intent is to sell it and its sale is highly probable. (Additionally,
accounting standards require that the asset must be available for immediate sale in its
present condition.)8 For instance, assume a building is no longer needed by a company
and management’s intent is to sell it. If the transaction meets the accounting criteria,
the building is reclassified from property, plant, and equipment to non-current assets
held for sale. At the time of reclassification, assets previously held for use are tested
for impairment. If the carrying amount at the time of reclassification exceeds the fair

                          value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down
                          to fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived assets held for sale cease to be depreciated
                          or amortized.


                          Reversals of Impairments of Long-Lived Assets
                          After an asset has been deemed impaired and an impairment loss has been reported,
                          the asset’s recoverable amount could potentially increase. For instance, a lawsuit
                          appeal may successfully challenge a patent infringement by another company, with
                          the result that a patent previously written down has a higher recoverable amount.
                          IFRS permit impairment losses to be reversed if the recoverable amount of an asset
                          increases regardless of whether the asset is classified as held for use or held for sale.
                          Note that IFRS permit the reversal of impairment losses only. IFRS do not permit the
                          revaluation to the recoverable amount if the recoverable amount exceeds the previ-
                          ous carrying amount. Under US GAAP, the accounting for reversals of impairments
                          depends on whether the asset is classified as held for use or held for sale.9 Under US
                          GAAP, once an impairment loss has been recognized for assets held for use, it cannot
                          be reversed. In other words, once the value of an asset held for use has been decreased
                          by an impairment charge, it cannot be increased. For assets held for sale, if the fair
                          value increases after an impairment loss, the loss can be reversed.


                          Derecognition
                          A company derecognizes an asset (i.e., removes it from the financial statements)
                          when the asset is disposed of or is expected to provide no future benefits from either
                          use or disposal. A company may dispose of a long-lived operating asset by selling it,
                          exchanging it, abandoning it, or distributing it to existing shareholders. As previously
                          described, non-current assets that management intends to sell or to distribute to
                          existing shareholders and which meet the accounting criteria (immediately avail-
                          able for sale in current condition and the sale is highly probable) are reclassified as
                          non-current assets held for sale.

                          Sale of Long-Lived Assets
                          The gain or loss on the sale of long-lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus
                          the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale. An asset’s carrying amount is
                          typically the net book value (i.e., the historical cost minus accumulated depreciation),
                          unless the asset’s carrying amount has been changed to reflect impairment and/or
                          revaluation, as previously discussed.

                             Assets

                             1. Moussilauke Diners Inc., a fictional company, is revamping its menus to fo-
                                cus on healthier food items. The company sells 450 used pizza ovens for $3.1
                                million. At the time of sale, the oven had a carrying amount that reflected an
                                original cost of $5.1 million and $3.2 million in accumulated depreciation.
                                What would be the reported gain or loss from selling the ovens?
                                 A. $0.1 million loss

       B. $1.2 million gain
       C. $3.1 million gain
      Solution to 1:
      B is correct. The ovens had a carrying amount of $5.1 – $3.2 = $1.9 million,
      and Moussilauke sold the ovens at a price of $3.1 million, resulting in a gain
      on the sale of $1.2 million. Ignoring taxes, the cash flow from the sale is $3.1
      million, which would be reported as a cash inflow from investing.

    A gain or loss on the sale of an asset is disclosed on the income statement, either
as a component of other gains and losses or in a separate line item when the amount
is material. A company typically discloses further detail about the sale in the man-
agement discussion and analysis and/or financial statement footnotes. In addition,
a statement of cash flows prepared using the indirect method adjusts net income
to remove any gain or loss on the sale from operating cash flow and to include the
amount of proceeds from the sale in cash from investing activities. Recall that the
indirect method of the statement of cash flows begins with net income and makes all
adjustments to arrive at cash from operations, including removal of gains or losses
from non-operating activities.

Long-Lived Assets Disposed of Other Than by a Sale
Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by a sale (e.g., abandoned, exchanged
for another asset, or distributed to owners in a spin-off ) are classified as held for use
until disposal or until they meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale or held
for distribution.10 Thus, the long-lived assets continue to be depreciated and tested
for impairment, unless their carrying amount is zero, as required for other long-lived
assets owned by the company.
     When an asset is retired or abandoned, the accounting is similar to a sale, except
that the company does not record cash proceeds. Assets are reduced by the carrying
amount of the asset at the time of retirement or abandonment, and a loss equal to
the asset’s carrying amount is recorded.
     When an asset is exchanged, accounting for the exchange typically involves
removing the carrying amount of the asset given up, adding a fair value for the asset
acquired, and reporting any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value
as a gain or loss. The fair value used is the fair value of the asset given up unless the
fair value of the asset acquired is more clearly evident. If no reliable measure of fair
value exists, the acquired asset is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given
up. A gain is reported when the fair value used for the newly acquired asset exceeds
the carrying amount of the asset given up. A loss is reported when the fair value used
for the newly acquired asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset given up. If
the acquired asset is valued at the carrying amount of the asset given up because no
reliable measure of fair value exists, no gain or loss is reported.
     When a spin-off occurs, typically, an entire cash generating unit of a company with
all its assets is spun off. As an illustration of a spin-off, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA)
spun off its ownership of Ferrari in 2016. Prior to the spin-off, FCA had sold 10 per-
cent of its ownership of Ferrari in an IPO and recognized an increase in Shareholders’
equity of EUR873 million (the difference between the consideration it received in the
IPO of EUR866 million and the carrying amount of the equity interest sold of EUR7
million.) In contrast, the spin-off, in which FCA distributed its ownership in Ferrari
to the existing FCA shareholders, did not result in any gain or loss.

                               FCA’s spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016, with each FCA shareholder
                          receiving one common share of Ferrari N.V. for every ten common shares of FCA. In
                          its financial statements for the prior fiscal year, FCA shows the assets and liabilities of
                          Ferrari as held for distribution. Specifically, its balance sheet includes € 3,650 million
                          in Assets Held for Distribution as a component of current assets and € 3,584 million
                          Liabilities Held for Distribution. Exhibit 2 includes excerpts from the company’s 31

                                           property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets
Presentation and Disclosure                                                                   223


Under IFRS, for each class of property, plant, and equipment, a company must disclose
the measurement basis, the depreciation method, the useful life (or, equivalently, the
depreciation rate) used, the gross carrying amount, and the accumulated depreciation
at the beginning and end of the period, and a reconciliation of the carrying amount at
the beginning and end of the period.11 In addition, disclosures of restrictions on title
and pledges as security of property, plant, and equipment and contractual agreements
to acquire property, plant, and equipment are required. If the revaluation model is
used, the date of revaluation, details of how the fair value was obtained, the carry-
ing amount under the cost model, and the revaluation surplus must be disclosed. A
company must also disclose the depreciation expense for the period, the balances
of major classes of depreciable assets, accumulated depreciation by major classes or
in total, and a general description of the depreciation method(s) used in computing
depreciation expense with respect to the major classes of depreciable assets.
    Under IFRS, for each class of intangible assets, a company must disclose whether
the useful lives are indefinite or finite. If finite, for each class of intangible asset, a
company must disclose the useful lives (or, equivalently, the amortization rate) used,
the amortization methods used, the gross carrying amount and the accumulated
amortization at the beginning and end of the period, where amortization is included
on the income statement, and a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning
and end of the period.12 If an asset has an indefinite life, the company must disclose
the carrying amount of the asset and why it is considered to have an indefinite life.
Similar to property, plant, and equipment, disclosures of restrictions on title and
pledges as security of intangible assets and contractual agreements to acquire intangible
assets are required. If the revaluation model is used, the date of revaluation, details
of how the fair value was obtained, the carrying amount under the cost model, and
the revaluation surplus must be disclosed.
    Under US GAAP, companies are required to disclose the gross carrying amounts
and accumulated amortization in total and by major class of intangible assets, the
aggregate amortization expense for the period, and the estimated amortization expense
for the next five fiscal years.13
    The disclosures related to impairment losses also differ under IFRS and US GAAP.
Under IFRS, a company must disclose for each class of assets the amounts of impair-
ment losses and reversals of impairment losses recognized in the period and where
those are recognized on the financial statements.14 The company must also disclose
in aggregate the main classes of assets affected by impairment losses and reversals
of impairment losses and the main events and circumstances leading to recognition
of these impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses. Under US GAAP,
there is no reversal of impairment losses for assets held for use. The company must
disclose a description of the impaired asset, what led to the impairment, the method
of determining fair value, the amount of the impairment loss, and where the loss is
recognized on the financial statements.15
    Disclosures about long-lived assets appear throughout the financial statements: in
the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of cash flows, and the notes.
The balance sheet reports the carrying value of the asset. For the income statement,
depreciation expense may or may not appear as a separate line item. Under IFRS,
whether the income statement discloses depreciation expense separately depends on

                          the entity.”16 Under the function of expense method, a company classifies expenses
                          according to the function, for example as part of cost of sales or of SG&A (selling,
                          general, and administrative) expenses. At a minimum, a company using the function
                          of expense method must disclose cost of sales, but the other line items vary.
                              The statement of cash flows reflects acquisitions and disposals of fixed assets in the
                          investing section. In addition, when prepared using the indirect method, the statement
                          of cash flows typically shows depreciation expense (or depreciation plus amortization)
                          as a line item in the adjustments of net income to cash flow from operations. The notes
                          to the financial statements describe the company’s accounting method(s), the range
                          of estimated useful lives, historical cost by main category of fixed asset, accumulated
                          depreciation, and annual depreciation expense.

      Exhibit 5: Orange SA, 2017 Analysis of the Group’s Financial Position
      and Earnings

      “Orange group operating income stood at 4,077 million euros in 2016,
      compared with 4,742 million euros in 2015 on a historical basis, a drop
      of 14.0% or 665 million euros. This drop on a historical basis was largely
      attributable to:
      ■     the recognition, in 2016, of 772 million euros in impairment loss of
            goodwill ... and 207 million euros in impairment loss of fixed assets
            ... primarily relating to:
            ●   Poland for 507 million euros. This impairment loss mainly
                reflects a decline in competitiveness in the ADSL market, a dete-
                rioration in revenue assumptions in the mobile market and an
                increase in the post-tax discount rate due to the downgrading of
                the country’s sovereign rating by the rating agencies,

            ●   Egypt for 232 million euros. This impairment loss reflects the
                financial terms of the 4G license awarded in 2016, the sharp
                depreciation of the Egyptian pound and increased political and
                economic uncertainty,

            ●   in the Congo (DRC), for 109 million euros. This impairment
                loss reflects political and economic uncertainty, a decline in
                purchasing power with a knock-on effect on the consumption of
                telecommunications products and services and an increased reg-
                ulatory burden (particularly connected with the implementation
                of customer identification),

                                 ●   Cameroon for 90 million euros. This impairment loss reflects
                                     a decline in voice revenues following the surge in messaging

                          1. What proportion of Orange’s total assets as of 31 December 2017 is repre-
                             sented by goodwill and other intangible assets?
                             Solution:
                             As of 31 December 2017, goodwill represents 28.6 percent (= 27,095 ÷
                             94,714) of Orange’s total assets. Other intangible assets represent 15.1
                             percent (= 14,339 ÷ 94,714). Data are from the company’s balance sheet in
                             Exhibit 3.

                          2. What is the largest component of the company’s impairment losses during
                             the year ending December 2016?
                             Solution:
                             The largest component of the EUR772 impairment loss on goodwill and the
                             EUR207 million impairment loss of fixed assets related to a EUR507 million
                             loss in Poland. The company attributed the loss to a decline in the com-
                             petitiveness of the market for its ADSL technology, a reduction in revenue
                             assumptions, and an increase in the discount rate resulting from the down-
                             grading of the country’s debt rating. From Exhibit 4:
                             [The company’s financial statements define ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital
                             Subscriber Line) as a “broadband data transmission technology on the tradi-
                             tional telephone network. It enables broadband data transmission (first and
                             foremost Internet access) via twisted paired copper cable (the most com-
                             mon type of telephone line found in buildings).”]

                          3. The company discloses that it determines whether an impairment loss
                             should be recognized by comparing the carrying value of a unit’s assets and
                             liabilities to the “recoverable amount,” equal to the company’s estimate of its
                             value in use. How does the company determine value in use?
                             Solution:
                             The company determines value in use – which it uses as a unit’s assets and
                             liabilities “recoverable amount” in impairment testing – as the present value
                             of the future expected cash flows. The cash flow projections are based on
                             management’s assumptions. From Note 7.4 in Exhibit 4.

                          4. By what amount would the estimated recoverable value of the company’s
                             operations in France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, and Romania change if the
                             company decreased its estimate of the perpetuity growth rate by 1 percent?
                             By what amount would the estimated recoverable value of these operations
                             change if the company increased its estimate of the post-tax discount rate by
                             1 percent?
                             Solution:
                             If the company decreased its estimate of the perpetuity growth rate by 1
                             percent, the estimated recoverable value of the company’s operations in
Using Disclosures in Analysis                                                                    229


      France, Spain, Poland, Belgium and Romania would be reduced by EUR13.2
      billion (=10.4 + 1.6 + 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.3). A decrease in estimated growth
      decreases the present value of the cash flows. If the company increased its
      estimate of the post-tax discount rate by 1 percent, the estimated recover-
      able value of these operations would be reduced by EUR14.6 billion (=11.4 +
      2.0 + 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.3). An increase in the discount rate decreases the present
      value of cash flows. Data are from Note 7.4 in Exhibit 4.

   5. What are the largest components of other intangible assets as of 31 Decem-
      ber 2017? What is the largest component of property, plant and equipment
      as of 31 December 2017?
      Solution:
      The largest components of other intangible assets as of 31 December 2017
      are telecommunications licenses, software, and the Orange brand, reported
      at EUR6,233 million, EUR3,946 million, and EUR3,133 million, respectively.
      The largest component of property, plant, and equipment as of 31 December
      2017 is network and terminals (EUR22,880 million). Data are from Notes 8.3
      and 8.4 in Exhibit 4.

   Note that the exhibits in the previous example contain relatively brief excerpts
from the company’s disclosures. The complete text of the disclosures concerning the
company’s non-current assets spans numerous different footnotes, some of which are
several pages long. Overall, an analyst can use the disclosures to understand a com-
pany’s investments in tangible and intangible assets, how those investments changed
during a reporting period, how those changes affected current performance, and what
those changes might indicate about future performance.




USING DISCLOSURES IN ANALYSIS
                                                                                             5
               analyze and interpret financial statement disclosures regarding
               property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets

Ratios used in analyzing fixed assets include the fixed asset turnover ratio and several
asset age ratios. The fixed asset turnover ratio (total revenue divided by average net
fixed assets) reflects the relationship between total revenues and investment in PPE
(property, plant, & equipment). The higher this ratio, the higher the amount of sales
a company is able to generate with a given amount of investment in fixed assets. A
higher asset turnover ratio is often interpreted as an indicator of greater efficiency.
    Asset age ratios generally rely on the relationship between historical cost and
depreciation. Under the revaluation model (permitted under IFRS but not US GAAP),
the relationship between carrying amount, accumulated depreciation, and depreciation
expense will differ when the carrying amount differs significantly from the depreciated
historical cost. Therefore, the following discussion of asset age ratios applies primarily
to PPE reported under the cost model.
    Asset age and remaining useful life, two asset age ratios, are important indicators
of a company’s need to reinvest in productive capacity. The older the assets and the
shorter the remaining life, the more a company may need to reinvest to maintain
productive capacity. The average age of a company’s asset base can be estimated as
accumulated depreciation divided by depreciation expense. The average remaining life
of a company’s asset base can be estimated as net PPE divided by depreciation expense.
230   Learning Module 7                                                                     Analysis of Long-Term Assets


                          These estimates simply reflect the following relationships for assets accounted for on
                          a historical cost basis: total historical cost minus accumulated depreciation equals
                          net PPE; and, under straight-line depreciation, total historical cost less salvage value
                          divided by estimated useful life equals annual depreciation expense. Equivalently,
                          total historical cost less salvage value divided by annual depreciation expense equals
                          estimated useful life. Assuming straight-line depreciation and no salvage value (for
                          simplicity), we have the following:
                           Estimated total useful life   =    Time elapsed since pur-       +   Estimated remaining life
                                                                   chase (Age)
                            Historical cost ÷ annual     =    Estimated total useful life
                             depreciation expense
                                 Historical cost         =   Accumulated depreciation       +           Net PPE

                          Equivalently,
                           Estimated total useful life   =       Estimated age of           +   Estimated remaining life
                                                                    equipment
                           Historical cost ÷ annual      =   Accumulated depreciation       +   Net PPE ÷ annual depre-
                            depreciation expense               ÷ annual depreciation                ciation expense
                                                                     expense

                          The application of these estimates can be illustrated by a hypothetical example of a
                          company with a single depreciable asset. Assume the asset initially cost USD100, had
                          an estimated useful life of 10 years, and an estimated salvage value of USD0. Each year,
                          the company records a depreciation expense of USD10, so accumulated depreciation
                          will equal USD10 times the number of years since the asset was acquired (when the
                          asset is 7 years old, accumulated depreciation will be USD70). Equivalently, the age
                          of the asset will equal accumulated depreciation divided by the annual depreciation
                          expense.
                              In practice, such estimates are difficult to make with great precision. Companies
                          use depreciation methods other than the straight-line method and have numerous
                          assets with varying useful lives and salvage values, including some assets that are
                          fully depreciated, so this approach produces an estimate only. Moreover, fixed asset
                          disclosures are often quite general. Consequently, these estimates may be primarily
                          useful to identify areas for further investigation.
                              One further measure compares a company’s current reinvestment in productive
                          capacity. Comparing annual capital expenditures to annual depreciation expense
                          provides an indication of whether productive capacity is being maintained. It is a very
                          general indicator of the rate at which a company is replacing its PPE relative to the
                          rate at which PPE is being depreciated.

   1. 1. Based on the data for each company in Exhibit 5, estimate the total useful
      life, age, and remaining useful life of PPE.
      Solution:

      and estimated remaining useful life of PPE for each of the companies.

      The computations are demonstrated using Verizon’s data ($ in millions).
      The estimated total useful life of PPE is total historical cost of PPE of
      USD246,498 divided by annual depreciation expense of USD14,741, giving
      16.7 years. Estimated age and estimated remaining life are obtained by di-
232   Learning Module 7                                                             Analysis of Long-Term Assets


                             viding accumulated depreciation of USD157,930 and net PPE of USD88,568
                             by the annual depreciation expense of USD14,741, giving 10.7 years and 6.0
                             years, respectively.
                             Ideally, the estimates of asset lives illustrated in this example should exclude
                             land, which is not depreciable, when the information is available; however,
                             both Orange and BCE report Land and Buildings as a combined amount.
                             We will use Verizon, for which land appeared to be disclosed separately in
                             the above table, to illustrate the estimates with adjusting for land. As an il-
                             lustration of the calculations to exclude land, excluding Verizon’s land would
                             give an estimated total useful life for the non-land PPE of 16.7 years [(total
                             cost EUR246,498 minus land cost of USD806) divided by annual deprecia-
                             tion expense of EUR14,741 million]. The estimate is essentially unchanged
                             from the estimate including land because land represents such a small com-
                             ponent of Verizon’s PPE.

                          2. 2. Interpret the estimates of estimated total useful life, age, and remaining
                             life. What items might affect comparisons across the three companies?
                             Solution:
                             The estimated total useful life suggests that Orange and BCE depreciate PPE
                             over a much longer period than Verizon: 20.6 and 22.8 years for Orange and
                             BCE, respectively, versus 16.7 years for Verizon.
                             The estimated age of the equipment suggests that Verizon has the newest
                             PPE with an estimated age of 10.7 years. Additionally, the estimates suggest
                             that around 73 percent of Orange’s assets’ useful lives have passed (15.0
                             years ÷ 20.6 years, or equivalently, EUR70,427 million ÷ EUR97,092 million).
                             In comparison, around 65 and 64 percent of the useful lives of the PPE of
                             BCE and Verizon, respectively, have passed.
                             Items that can affect comparisons across the companies include business
                             differences, such as differences in composition of the companies’ opera-
                             tions and differences in acquisition and divestiture activity. This result can
                             be compared, to an extent, to the useful lives and asset mix disclosed in the
                             companies’ footnotes; however, differences in disclosures (e.g., in the cate-
                             gories of assets disclosed) can affect comparisons.

                          3. 3. How does each company’s 2017 depreciation expense compare to its capi-
                             tal expenditures for the year?
                             Solution:
                             All three companies’ capital expenditure exceeds its depreciation expense.
                             Rounding to the nearest 10 percent, capital expenditure as a percentage
                             of depreciation is 120 percent for Orange, 140 percent for BCE, and 120
                             percent for Verizon. All three companies are replacing PPE at a faster rate
                             than the PPE is being depreciated, consistent with the companies’ somewhat
                             older asset base.

                          4. 4. Calculate and compare fixed asset turnover for each company.
                             Solution:
                             Fixed asset turnover is calculated as total revenues divided by average net
                             PPE. Orange’s fixed asset turnover is 1.6 (= 41,096/((26,665 + 25,912)/2)).
                             BCE’s fixed asset turnover is 1.0, and Verizon’s fixed asset turnover is 1.5.
                             Orange’s and Verizon’s higher levels of fixed asset turnover indicate these
                             companies, compared to BCE, are able to generate more sales per unit of
                             investment in fixed assets.

                             company. In reviewing the company’s 2022 annual report, Hart is concerned
                             about some of the accounting choices that the new management has made. These
                             choices differ from those of the previous management and from common indus-
                             try practice. Hart has highlighted the following statements from the company’s
                             annual report:

                                 Statement 1    “In 2022, AMRC spent significant amounts on track replace-
                                                ment and similar improvements. AMRC expensed rather than
                                                capitalized a significant proportion of these expenditures.”

                                 Statement 2    “AMRC uses the straight-line method of depreciation for both
                                                financial and tax reporting purposes to account for plant and
                                                equipment.”

                                 Statement 3    “In 2022, AMRC recognized an impairment loss of €50 million
                                                on a fleet of locomotives. The impairment loss was reported as
                                                ‘other income’ in the income statement and reduced the carry-
                                                ing amount of the assets on the balance sheet.”

                          The following information relates to questions
                          8-13
                            Brian Jordan is interviewing for a junior equity analyst position at Orion Invest-
                            ment Advisors. As part of the interview process, Mary Benn, Orion’s Director of
                            Research, provides Jordan with information about two hypothetical companies,
                            Alpha and Beta, and asks him to comment on the companies’ financial state-
                            ments and ratios. Both companies prepare their financial statements in accor-
                            dance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are identical
                            in all respects except for their accounting choices.
                            Jordan is told that, at the beginning of the current fiscal year, both companies
                            purchased a major new computer system and began building new manufactur-
                            ing plants for their own use. Alpha capitalized and Beta expensed the cost of the
                            computer system; Alpha capitalized and Beta expensed the interest costs associ-
                            ated with the construction of the manufacturing plants.
                            Benn asks Jordan, “What was the impact of these decisions on each company’s
                            current fiscal year financial statements and ratios?”
                            Jordan responds, “Alpha’s decision to capitalize the cost of its new computer
                            system instead of expensing it results in lower net income, lower total assets, and
                            higher cash flow from operating activities in the current fiscal year. Alpha’s de-
                            cision to capitalize its interest costs instead of expensing them results in a lower
                            fixed asset turnover ratio and a higher interest coverage ratio.”
                            Jordan is told that Alpha uses the straight-line depreciation method and Beta
                            uses an accelerated depreciation method; both companies estimate the same
                            useful lives for long-lived assets. Many companies in their industry use the
                            units-of-production method.
                            Benn asks Jordan, “What are the financial statement implications of each depre-
                            ciation method, and how do you determine a company’s need to reinvest in its
                            productive capacity?”
                            Jordan replies, “All other things being equal, the straight-line depreciation meth-
                            od results in the least variability of net profit margin over time, while an acceler-
                            ated depreciation method results in a declining trend in net profit margin over
                            time. The units-of-production can result in a net profit margin trend that is quite
                            variable. I use a three-step approach to estimate a company’s need to reinvest in
                            its productive capacity. First, I estimate the average age of the assets by dividing
                            net property, plant, and equipment by annual depreciation expense. Second, I
                            estimate the average remaining useful life of the assets by dividing accumulated
                            depreciation by depreciation expense. Third, I add the estimates of the average
                            remaining useful life and the average age of the assets in order to determine the
                            total useful life.”
                            Jordan is told that at the end of the current fiscal year, Alpha revalued a manu-
                            facturing plant; this increased its reported carrying amount by 15 percent. There
                            was no previous downward revaluation of the plant. Beta recorded an impair-
                            ment loss on a manufacturing plant; this reduced its carrying value by 10 percent.
Practice Problems                                                                        237


   Benn asks Jordan “What was the impact of these decisions on each company’s
   current fiscal year financial ratios?”
   Jordan responds, “Beta’s impairment loss increases its debt to total assets and
   fixed asset turnover ratios, and lowers its cash flow from operating activities.
   Alpha’s revaluation increases its debt to capital and return on assets ratios, and
   reduces its return on equity.”

8. Jordan’s response about the financial statement impact of Alpha’s decision to
   capitalize the cost of its new computer system is correct with respect to:
   A. lower net income.

   B. lower total assets.

   C. higher cash flow from operating activities.

9. Jordan’s response about the ratio impact of Alpha’s decision to capitalize interest
   costs is most likely correct with respect to the:
   A. interest coverage ratio.

   B. fixed asset turnover ratio.

   C. interest coverage and fixed asset turnover ratios.

10. Jordan’s response about the impact of the different depreciation methods on net
    profit margin is most likely incorrect with respect to:
   A. accelerated depreciation.

   B. straight-line depreciation.

   C. units-of-production depreciation.

11. Jordan’s response about his approach to estimating a company’s need to reinvest
    in its productive capacity is most likely correct regarding estimating the:
   A. average age of the asset base.

   B. total useful life of the asset base.

   C. average remaining useful life of the asset base.

12. Jordan’s response about the effect of Beta’s impairment loss is incorrect with
    respect to the impact on its:
   A. debt to total assets.

   B. fixed asset turnover.

   C. cash flow from operating activities.

13. Jordan’s response about the effect of Alpha’s revaluation is most likely correct
    with respect to the impact on its:
   A. return on equity.

   B. return on assets.

   C. debt to capital ratio.

                          14-19
                              A financial analyst at BETTO S.A. is analyzing the result of the sale of a vehicle
                              for 85,000 Argentine pesos (ARP) on 31 December 2021. The analyst compiles
                              the following information about the vehicle:

                          14. The result of the sale of the vehicle is most likely:
                              A. a loss of ARP 15,000.

                              B. a gain of ARP 15,000.

                              C. a gain of ARP 18,333.

                              million and an accumulated amortization of EUR2 million and reports a loss on
                              the sale of EUR3.2 million. Which of the following amounts is most likely the sale
                              price of the asset?

   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. The impairment loss equals GBP3,100,000, calculated as:
   Impairment = max(Fair value less costs to sell; Value in use) – Net carrying
   amount
   = max(16,800,000 – 800,000; 14,500,000) – 19,100,000
   = –3,100,000.

2. B is correct. Under IFRS, an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the
   carrying amount over the asset’s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
   is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value
   in use is a discounted measure of expected future cash flows. Under US GAAP,
   assessing recoverability is separate from measuring the impairment loss. If the
   asset’s carrying amount exceeds its undiscounted expected future cash flows, the
   asset’s carrying amount is considered unrecoverable and the impairment loss is
   measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the asset’s fair value.

3. C is correct. The carrying amount of the asset on the balance sheet is reduced by
   the amount of the impairment loss, and the impairment loss is reported on the
   income statement.

4. C is correct. Expensing, rather than capitalizing, an investment in long-term
   assets will result in higher expenses and lower net income and net profit margin
   in the current year. Future years’ incomes will not include depreciation expense
   related to these expenditures. Consequently, year-to-year growth in profitability
   will be higher. If the expenses had been capitalized, the carrying amount of the
   assets would have been higher and the 2022 total asset turnover would have been
   lower.

5. C is correct. Switching to an accelerated depreciation method would increase
   depreciation expense and decrease income before taxes, taxes payable, and net
   income. Cash flow from operating activities would increase because of the result-
   ing tax savings.

6. B is correct. 2022 net income and net profit margin are lower because of the
   impairment loss. Consequently, net profit margins in subsequent years are likely
   to be higher. An impairment loss suggests that insufficient depreciation expense
   was recognized in prior years, and net income was overstated in prior years. The
   impairment loss is a non-cash item and will not affect operating cash flows.

7. A is correct. The estimated average remaining useful life is 20.75 years, calculated
   as:
   Estimate of remaining useful life = Net plant and equipment ÷ Annual deprecia-
   tion expense
   Net plant and equipment = Plant & equipment – Accumulated depreciation
   = EUR6,000 – EUR1,850 = EUR4,150
   Estimate of remaining useful life = Net P & E ÷ Depreciation expense
   = EUR4,150 ÷ EUR200 = 20.75

8. C is correct. The decision to capitalize the costs of the new computer system re-
   sults in higher cash flow from operating activities; the expenditure is reported as
   an outflow of investing activities. The company allocates the capitalized amount
   over the asset’s useful life as depreciation or amortization expense rather than
   expensing it in the year of expenditure. Net income and total assets are higher in

                             the current fiscal year.

                          9. B is correct. Alpha’s fixed asset turnover will be lower because the capitalized
                             interest will appear on the balance sheet as part of the asset being constructed.
                             Therefore, fixed assets will be higher and the fixed asset turnover ratio (total
                             revenue/average net fixed assets) will be lower than if it had expensed these
                             costs. Capitalized interest appears on the balance sheet as part of the asset being
                             constructed instead of being reported as interest expense in the period incurred.
                             However, the interest coverage ratio should be based on interest payments, not
                             interest expense (earnings before interest and taxes/interest payments) and
                             should be unchanged. To provide a true picture of a company’s interest coverage,
                             the entire amount of interest expenditure, both the capitalized portion and the
                             expensed portion, should be used in calculating interest coverage ratios.

                          10. A is correct. Accelerated depreciation will result in an improving, not declining,
                              net profit margin over time, because the amount of depreciation expense declines
                              each year. Under straight-line depreciation, the amount of depreciation expense
                              will remain the same each year. Under the units-of-production method, the
                              amount of depreciation expense reported each year varies with the number of
                              units produced.

                          11. B is correct. The estimated average total useful life of a company’s assets is calcu-
                              lated by adding the estimates of the average remaining useful life and the average
                              age of the assets. The average age of the assets is estimated by dividing accumu-
                              lated depreciation by depreciation expense. The average remaining useful life
                              of the asset base is estimated by dividing net property, plant, and equipment by
                              annual depreciation expense.

                          12. C is correct. The impairment loss is a non-cash charge and will not affect cash
                              flow from operating activities. The debt to total assets and fixed asset turnover
                              ratios will increase, because the impairment loss will reduce the carrying amount
                              of fixed assets and therefore total assets.

                          13. A is correct. In an asset revaluation, the carrying amount of the assets increases.
                              The increase in the asset’s carrying amount bypasses the income statement and is
                              reported as other comprehensive income and appears in equity under the head-
                              ing of revaluation surplus. Therefore, shareholders’ equity will increase but net
                              income will not be affected, so return on equity will decline. Return on assets and
                              debt to capital ratios will also decrease.

                          14. B is correct. The result on the sale of the vehicle is a gain of 15,000, calculated as:
                              Gain or loss on the sale = Sale proceeds – Carrying amount
                              = Sale proceeds – (Acquisition cost – Accumulated depreciation)
                              = 85,000 – {100,000 – [((100,000 – 10,000)/9 years) × 3 years]}
                              = 15,000.

                          15. A is correct. Gain or loss on the sale = Sale proceeds – Carrying amount. Rear-
                              ranging this equation, Sale proceeds = Carrying amount + Gain or loss on sale.
                              Thus, Sale price = (12 million – 2 million) + (–3.2 million) = 6.8 million.

                          16. A is correct. The gain or loss on the sale of long-lived assets is computed as the
                              sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale. This is
                              true under the cost and revaluation models of reporting long-lived assets. In the
                              absence of impairment losses, under the cost model, the carrying amount will
                              equal historical cost net of accumulated depreciation.

                          17. B is correct. IFRS do not require acquisition dates to be disclosed.
Solutions                                                                                   243


18. A is correct. IFRS do not require fair value of intangible assets to be disclosed.

19. C is correct. Under US GAAP, companies are required to disclose the estimated
    amortization expense for the next five fiscal years. Under US GAAP, there is no
    reversal of impairment losses. Disclosure of the useful lives—finite or indefinite
    and additional related details—is required under IFRS.

20. A is correct. A product patent with a defined expiration date is an intangible asset
    with a finite useful life. A copyright with no expiration date is an intangible asset
    with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is no longer considered an intangible asset
    under IFRS and is considered to have an indefinite useful life.

21. C is correct. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized, whereas an
    intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized. Rather, they are
    carried on the balance sheet at historical cost and are tested at least annually for
    impairment.

22. A is correct. The costs to internally develop intangible assets are generally ex-
    pensed when incurred.

23. C is correct. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, if an item is acquired in a business
    combination and cannot be recognized as a tangible asset or identifiable intan-
    gible asset, it is recognized as goodwill. Under US GAAP, assets arising from
    contractual or legal rights and assets that can be separated from the acquired
    company are recognized separately from goodwill.

                          ■   The financial reporting of a lease depends on whether the party is the
                              lessee or lessor, whether the party reports with IFRS or US GAAP, and
                              the classification of the lease as finance or operating.
                          ■   US GAAP and IFRS share the same accounting treatment for lessors
                              but differ slightly for lessees. IFRS has a single accounting model for
                              both operating leases and finance lease lessees, while US GAAP has an
                              accounting model for each.
                          ■   Two types of pension plans are defined contribution plans and defined
                              benefits plans. In a defined contribution plan, the amount of employer
                              contribution into the plan is specified (i.e., defined) and the amount
                              of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree)
                              depends on the performance of the plan’s assets. In a defined ben-
                              efit plan, the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the plan
                              (received by the retiree) is defined, usually according to a benefit
                              formula.
                          ■   In a defined contribution plan, employees bear investment risks (i.e.,
                              the potential for investment returns on plan assets to differ from
                              expectations) and actuarial risks (i.e. the potential for retirement and
                              death timing to differ from expectations). In a defined benefit plan,
                              employers bear both investment and actuarial risks.
                          ■   Under a defined contribution pension plan, the cash payment made
                              into the plan is recognized as pension expense.
                          ■   For defined benefit pension plans, companies must report the dif-
                              ference between the defined benefit pension obligation and the fair
                              value of pension assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. An
                              underfunded defined benefit pension plan is shown as a non-current
                              liability. The change in the net asset or liability between balance sheet
                              dates is recognized as a cost of the period, with service cost and net
                              interest expense or income recognized in profit and loss and remea-
                              surement changes recognized in other comprehensive income. There
                              are modest differences in accounting treatment under US GAAP.
                          ■   Employee compensation packages are structured to fulfill various
                              objectives, including satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retain-
                              ing employees, and providing incentives to employees.
                          ■   Share-based compensation serves to align employees’ interests with
                              those of the shareholders. It typically includes stock grants and stock
                              options, which have the advantage of requiring no current-period cash
                              outlays. Stock-based compensation is measured using fair value at the
                              grant date and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting
                              period.

                              in a compensation agreement and is disclosed in the notes to financial
                              statements. Key inputs into option pricing models include such items
                              as exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of each award,
                              estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and
                              the risk-free rate of interest.

LEASES
                                                                                                                           2
                   explain the financial reporting of leases from the perspectives of
                   lessors and lessees

Firms typically acquire the rights to use assets by outright purchase. As an alterna-
tive, a lease is a contract that conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration. The party who uses the asset and pays the consideration
is the lessee, and the party who owns the asset, grants the right to use the asset, and
receives consideration is the lessor.
    Leasing is a way to obtain the benefits of the asset without purchasing it outright.
From the perspective of a lessee, it is a form of financing that resembles acquiring
an asset with a note payable. From the perspective of a lessor, a lease is a form of
investment and can also be an effective selling strategy, because customers generally
prefer to pay in installments.
    After reviewing the contractual requirements for a lease, this lesson examines the
advantages and classification of leases and their financial reporting.


Requirements for Lease Accounting
For a contract to be a lease or contain a lease, it must
     ■    identify a specific underlying asset;
     ■    give the customer the right to obtain largely all of the economic benefits
          from the asset over the contract term; and
     ■    give the customer, not the supplier, the ability to direct how and for what
          objective the underlying asset is used.
    For example, a contract between a customer and a trucking company is a lease if
the contract identifies a specific truck, allows the customer exclusive use of it during
the contract term, and lets the customer direct its use. If, however, the customer
contracts with a trucking company to ship goods for a fee, the contract would not be
a lease, because a specific truck is not identified nor does the customer obtain largely
all of the economic benefits from the truck over the contract term.


Examples of Leases
Leasing is among the most prevalent forms of financing. Most companies are lessees
of real estate and information technology assets. In 2014, the International Accounting
Standards Board found that more than 14,000 publicly listed companies were lessees
and that they owed more than USD3.3 trillion in future lease payments in aggre-
gate.1Exhibit 1 illustrates several examples of these arrangements.

                          Advantages of Leasing
                          There are several advantages to leasing an asset compared with purchasing it:
                              ■     Less cash is needed up front. Leases typically require little, if any, down
                                    payment.
                              ■     Cost effectiveness: Leases are a form of secured borrowing; in the event of
                                    non-payment, the lessor simply repossesses the leased asset. As a result,
                                    the effective interest rate for a lease is typically lower than what the lessee
                                    would pay on an unsecured loan or bond.
                              ■     Convenience and lower risks associated with asset ownership, such as
                                    obsolescence.3
                              From the perspective of a lessor, leasing has advantages over selling outright, which
                          include earning interest income over the lease term and increasing the addressable
                          market for its product by offering customers the ability to use or control an asset
                          while paying smaller amounts over time.


                          Lease Classification as Finance or Operating
                          Leases can resemble either the purchase of an asset or a rental contract. For example,
                          a ten-year lease of an automobile with a ten-year useful life for monthly payments that,
                          in aggregate, are equal to or greater than the fair value of the automobile is effectively
                          a debt-financed purchase of that automobile. In contrast, a one-year lease of a machine
                          with a twenty-year useful life resembles a rental contract. A lease that resembles a
                          purchase is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are operating leases.

    More specifically, a lease is a finance lease if any of the following five criteria are
met. These criteria are the same for IFRS and US GAAP. If none of the criteria are
met, the lease is an operating lease. The same criteria are used by lessees and lessors
in classifying a lease.
   1. The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee.
   2. The lessee has an option to purchase the underlying asset and is reasonably
      certain it will do so.
   3. The lease term is for a major part of the asset’s useful life.
   4. The present value of the sum of the lease payments equals or exceeds sub-
      stantially all of the fair value of the asset.
   5. The underlying asset has no alternative use to the lessor.


EXAMPLE 1

   Lease Identification and Classification
   Company C enters a contract with Company D that requires Company C to
   pay JPY100 million at the end of each of the next two years to Company D for
   exclusive use of a specific machine over that time period. The present value of
   the payments is JPY186 million. At the end of the contract, Company C will
   return the machine to Company D. The contract does not contain a purchase
   option. The machine can be used in many applications by many types of cus-
   tomers. The remaining useful life of the machine is four years, and its fair value
   is JPY190 million.

   1. This contract is:
         A. not a lease.
         B. an operating lease.
       C. a finance lease.
      Solution:
      C is correct. This contract is a lease because a specific asset is identified,
      Company C will exclusively use it, and Company C will have the ability to
      direct its use. The contract is a finance lease because one of the five criteria
      is met: The present value of the lease payments equals substantially all of the
      fair value (186/190 = 98%).

   2. If the fair value of the machine in question 1 was JPY300 million, would the
      classification of the contract change?
         A. No
         B. Yes, from an operating lease to a finance lease
       C. Yes, from a finance lease to an operating lease
      Solution:
      C is correct. This change would result in the lease not meeting any of the
      five criteria for a finance lease. If a lease does not meet any of the five crite-
      ria, it is an operating lease.

                          Financial Reporting of Leases
                          The financial reporting of a lease depends on whether the party is the lessee or lessor,
                          whether the party reports with IFRS or US GAAP, and the classification of the lease as
                          finance or operating. Additionally, for lessees, there are lease accounting exemptions
                          for certain lease contracts: If its term is 12 months or less (IFRS and US GAAP) or it
                          is for a “low-value asset,” up to USD5,000 in sales price (IFRS only), then the lessee
                          can elect to simply expense the lease payments on a straight-line basis. These exemp-
                          tions are not available to lessors. Exhibit 2 illustrates the different permutations for
                          lease accounting.

                          Fortunately, lessor accounting under both IFRS and US GAAP is substantially identical,
                          and the differences in treatment for lessees are modest.


                          Lessee Accounting—IFRS
                          Under IFRS, there is a single accounting model for both finance and operating
                          leases for lessees. At lease inception, the lessee records a lease payable liability and a
                          right-of-use (ROU) asset on its balance sheet, both equal to the present value of future
                          lease payments. The discount rate used in the present value calculation is either the
                          rate implicit in the lease or an estimated secured borrowing rate.
                              The lease liability is subsequently reduced by each lease payment using the effective
                          interest method. Each lease payment is composed of interest expense, which is the
                          product of the lease liability and the discount rate, and principal repayment, which
                          is the difference between the interest expense and lease payment.
                              The ROU asset is subsequently amortized, often on a straight-line basis, over the
                          lease term. So, although the lease liability and ROU asset begin with the same carrying
                          value on the balance sheet, they typically diverge in subsequent periods because the
                          principal repayment that reduces the lease liability and the amortization expense that
                          reduces the ROU asset are calculated differently.
                              The following list shows how the transaction affects the financial statements:
                              ■   The lease liability net of principal repayments and the ROU asset net of
                                  accumulated amortization are reported on the balance sheet.
Leases                                                                                      251


   ■     Interest expense on the lease liability and the amortization expense related
         to the ROU asset are reported separately on the income statement.
   ■     The principal repayment component of the lease payment is reported as a
         cash outflow under financing activities on the statement of cash flows, and
         depending on the lessee’s reporting policies, interest expense is reported
         under either operating or financing activities on the statement of cash flows.


EXAMPLE 2

  Lease Impact on Balance Sheet and Income Statement
  Proton Enterprises, a hypothetical manufacturer based in Germany, is offered
  the following terms to lease a machine: five-year lease with an implied interest
  rate of 10 percent and an annual lease payment of EUR100,000 per year pay-
  able at the end of each year. The present value of the machinery is therefore
  EUR379,079 (in Microsoft Excel, the formula is =PV(10%,5,-100,000). The asset
  will be amortized over the five-year lease term on a straight-line basis. Proton
  reports under IFRS.

  1. What would be the impact of this lease on Proton’s balance sheet at the
     beginning of the year?
       Solution:
       Proton would report a EUR379,079 lease liability and ROU asset.

  2. What would be the impact of this lease on Proton’s income statement during
     the following year?
       Solution:
       Interest expense and amortization expense are reported on the income
       statement. In Year 2, interest expense is EUR31,699 and amortization ex-
       pense is EUR 75,816, as illustrated in the following tables:

                          Lessee Accounting—US GAAP
                          Under US GAAP, there are two accounting models for lessees: one for finance leases
                          and another for operating leases. The finance lease accounting model is identical to the
                          lessee accounting model for IFRS. The operating lease accounting model is different.
                              At operating lease inception, the lessee records a lease payable liability and a corre-

                          principal repayment component of the lease payment and amortization, respectively,
                          in the same manner that an IFRS lessee would.
                              The key difference between an operating lease and a finance lease is how the
                          amortization of the ROU asset is calculated. For an operating lease, the lessee’s ROU
                          asset amortization expense is the lease payment minus the interest expense. The
                          implication is that the total expense reported on the income statement (interest plus
                          amortization) will equal the lease payment and that the lease liability and the ROU
                          asset will always equal each other because the principal repayment and amortization
                          are calculated in an identical manner.
                              The following list shows how the transaction appears on the financial statements:
                              ■    The lease liability net of principal repayments and the ROU asset net of
                                   accumulated amortization are reported on the balance sheet.
                              ■    Interest expense on the lease liability and the amortization expense related
                                   to the ROU asset are reported as a single line titled “lease expense” as an
                                   operating expense on the income statement. The interest and amortization
                                   components are not reported separately, nor are they grouped with other
                                   types of interest and amortization expense (e.g., interest on a bond, amorti-
                                   zation of an intangible asset).
                              ■    The entire lease payment is reported as a cash outflow under operating
                                   activities on the statement of cash flows. The interest and principal repay-
                                   ment components are not reported separately.

EXAMPLE 3

  Lessee Accounting—Operating Lease under US GAAP
  Consider the differences in accounting if Proton Enterprises classified the lease
  of the machinery from Example 2 as an operating lease.

  1. How would its financial statements differ, if at all?
     Solution:
     The first step is to construct the lease liability and ROU asset amortization
     tables under an operating lease scenario. The lease liability amortization is
     the same as the finance lease columns FO.1–FO.4 in Example 2.

                          Lessor Accounting
                          The accounting for lessors is substantially identical under IFRS and US GAAP. Under
                          both accounting standards, lessors classify leases as finance or operating leases, which
                          determines the financial reporting. Although lessors under US GAAP recognize finance
                          leases as either “sales-type” or “direct financing,” the distinction is immaterial from
                          an analyst’s perspective.
Leases                                                                                    255


    At finance lease inception, the lessor recognizes a lease receivable asset equal to
the present value of future lease payments and de-recognizes the leased asset, simul-
taneously recognizing any difference as a gain or loss. The discount rate used in the
present value calculation is the rate implicit in the lease.
    The lease receivable is subsequently reduced by each lease payment using the
effective interest method. Each lease payment is composed of interest income, which
is the product of the lease receivable and the discount rate, and principal proceeds,
which equals the difference between the interest income and cash receipt.
    The transaction affects the financial statements in the following ways:
   ■     Lease receivable net of principal proceeds is reported on the balance sheet.
   ■     Interest income is reported on the income statement. If leasing is a primary
         business activity for the entity, as it commonly is for financial institutions
         and independent leasing companies, it is reported as revenue.
   ■     The entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the state-
         ment of cash flows.
    The accounting treatment for an operating lease is different: because the contract
is essentially a rental agreement, the lessor keeps the leased asset on its books and
recognizes lease revenue on a straight-line basis. Interest revenue is not recognized
because the transaction is not considered a financing.
    The transaction affects the financial statements in the following ways:
   ■     The balance sheet is not affected. The lessor continues to recognize the
         leased asset at cost net of accumulated depreciation.
   ■     Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis on the income state-
         ment. Depreciation expense continues to be recognized.
   ■     The entire cash receipt is reported under operating activities on the state-
         ment of cash flows. This is the same as a finance lease.


EXAMPLE 4

  Lessor Accounting
  Let’s examine Proton’s machine lease from Example 2 and Example 3 from the
  perspective of the lessor. Assume that the carrying value of the asset immediately
  prior to the lease is EUR350,000, accumulated depreciation is zero, and the lessor
  elects to depreciate it on a straight-line basis over five years.

  1. How are the lessor’s financial statements affected by the classification of the
     lease as a finance or operating lease?
       Solution:
       The difference on the balance sheet is material, because a finance lease
       requires the lessor to de-recognize the asset and recognize a lease receiv-
       able, whereas an operating lease lessor continues to recognize the asset and
       depreciate it over its useful life. In this case, where the present value of the
       lease payments is well above the carrying value of the asset, the finance lease
       classification results in a significant increase in assets.

                          SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

                                        explain the financial reporting of defined contribution, defined
                                        benefit, and stock-based compensation plans



                          Employee Compensation
                          Employee compensation packages are structured to achieve various objectives, includ-
                          ing satisfying employees’ needs for liquidity, retaining employees, and motivating
                          employees. Common components of employee compensation are salary, bonuses,
                          health and life insurance premiums, defined contribution and benefit pension plans,
                          and share-based compensation. The amount of compensation and its composition are
                          determined in labor markets, which vary significantly by the types of skills needed,
                          geography, the stage of the business cycle, and labor laws and customs.
Financial Reporting for Postemployment and Share-Based Compensation Plans                   257


    The salary component of compensation provides for the liquidity needs of an
employee. Bonuses, generally in the form of cash, motivate and reward employees
for short- or long-term performance or goal achievement by linking pay to perfor-
mance. Non-monetary benefits, such as health and life insurance premiums, housing,
and vehicles, may be provided to facilitate employees performing their jobs. Salary,
bonuses, and non-monetary benefits tend to vest (i.e., employee earns the right to
the consideration) immediately or shortly after their grant date. In terms of financial
reporting, a company reports compensation expense on the income statement in the
period in which compensation vests. Immediate or short-term vesting makes the
accounting for salary, most non-monetary benefits, and bonuses straightforward:
when the employee has earned the salary or bonus, an expense is recorded for the
fair value of the compensation, and a cash outflow or accrued compensation liability
(a current liability) is recognized. Expenses and cash outflows for short-term com-
pensation tend to be well matched.


Deferred Compensation
Deferred compensation vests over time and can provide valuable retirement savings and
financial upside to employees and often serve as an effective retention and stakeholder
alignment tool for employers. The financial reporting for deferred compensation plans
is generally more complex than that for compensation that vests immediately because
of the difficulty in measurement and potential lags between employee service and
cash outflows. Employees may earn compensation in the current period but receive
consideration in future periods, and the amount of consideration can be based on
factors such as their future salary or the employer’s stock price. Management judgment
and assumptions are required.
    Pensions and other postemployment benefit plans are a common type of deferred
compensation. Two common types of pension plans are defined contribution pen-
sion plans and defined benefit pension plans. Under a defined-contribution plan, a
company contributes an agreed-upon amount into the plan, which may be structured
as a match to employees’ contributions into the plan (e.g., 50 percent of 5 percent
of employees’ contribution up to a certain limit). The company contribution is the
pension expense and is reported as an operating cash outflow. The only impact on
assets and liabilities is a decrease in cash, although if some portion of the agreed-upon
amount has not been paid by fiscal year-end, an accrued compensation liability would
be recognized on the balance sheet. Because the amount of the contribution is defined
and the company has no further obligation once the contribution has been made,
accounting for a defined-contribution plan is straightforward.
    Companies may also offer other types of postemployment benefit plans, such as
retiree healthcare plans. These plans also incur non-current liabilities for employers
but tend to be far smaller than pension plans and are typically not funded in advance;
thus, benefit payments are often expensed as incurred.


Defined-Benefit Pension Plans
Under a defined-benefit pension plan, a company makes promises of future benefits
to be paid to the employee during retirement. For example, a company could prom-
ise an employee annual pension payments equal to 70 percent of her final salary at
retirement until death. Measuring the obligation arising from that promise requires
the company to make many assumptions, such as the employee’s expected salary at
retirement and the number of years the employee is expected to live beyond retire-
ment. The company estimates the future amounts to be paid and discounts the future
estimated amounts to a present value (using a discount rate equal to the yield on a
258   Learning Module 8                                                    Topics in Long-Term Liabilities and Equity


                          high-quality corporate bond) to determine the pension obligation today. The discount
                          rate and other assumptions used to determine the pension obligation significantly
                          affects the size of the pension obligation.
                              Most defined-benefit pension plans are funded through assets held in a separate
                          legal entity, typically a pension trust fund. A company makes payments into the pen-
                          sion fund and retirees are paid from the fund. The payments that a company makes
                          into the fund are invested until they are needed to pay the retirees. If the fair value of
                          the plan’s assets is higher than the present value of the estimated pension obligation,
                          the plan has a surplus and the company will report a net pension asset on its balance
                          sheet. Conversely, if the present value of the estimated pension obligation exceeds
                          the fair value of the fund’s assets, the plan has a deficit and the company will report
                          a net pension liability on its balance sheet.


                          Accounting for Defined-Benefit Plans under IFRS
                          Under IFRS, the change in the net pension asset or liability each period is viewed as
                          having three general components. Two of the components of this change are recognized
                          as pension expense on the income statement: (1) employees’ service costs, and (2) the
                          net interest expense or income accrued on the beginning net pension asset or liability.
                              The service cost during the period for an employee is the present value of the
                          increase in the pension benefit earned by the employee as a result of providing one
                          more year of service. The service cost also includes any effects from changes in the
                          plan, known as past service costs.
                              The net interest expense or income represents the change in the present value
                          of the net defined benefit pension asset or liability from the passage of time (i.e., a
                          liability would increase over time as payout dates near) and is calculated as the net
                          pension asset or liability multiplied by the discount rate.
                              The third component of the change in the net pension asset or liability during
                          a period (i.e., “remeasurements”) is recognized in other comprehensive income.
                          Remeasurements are not amortized into profit or loss over time. Remeasurements
                          include (1) actuarial gains and losses and (2) the actual return on plan assets less any
                          return included in the net interest expense or income. Actuarial gains and losses can
                          occur when changes are made to the assumptions on which a company bases its esti-
                          mated pension obligation (e.g., employee turnover, mortality rates, retirement ages,
                          compensation increases). The actual return on plan assets includes interest, dividends,
                          and other income derived from the plan assets, including realized and unrealized
                          gains or losses. The actual return typically differs from the amount included in the net
                          interest expense or income, which is calculated using a rate reflective of a high-quality
                          corporate bond yield; plan assets are typically allocated across various asset classes,
                          including equity as well as bonds.


                          Accounting for Defined-Benefit Plan under US GAAP
                          Under US GAAP, the change in net pension asset or liability each period is viewed
                          as having five components, some of which are recognized in profit and loss in the
                          period incurred and some of which are recognized in other comprehensive income
                          and amortized into profit and loss over time.
                              The three components recognized on the income statement in the period incurred
                          are as follows:
                             1. employees’ service costs for the period;
                             2. interest expense accrued on the beginning pension obligation; and
                             3. expected return on plan assets, which is a reduction in the amount of
                                expense recognized.
Financial Reporting for Postemployment and Share-Based Compensation Plans                  259


    The other two components are past service costs and actuarial gains and losses. Past
service costs are recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they
arise and then subsequently amortized into pension expense over the future service
period of the employees covered by the plan. Actuarial gains and losses are typically
also recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur
and then amortized into pension expense over time. In effect, this treatment allows
companies to “smooth” the effects on pension expense over time for these latter two
components. US GAAP does permit companies to immediately recognize actuarial
gains and losses in profit and loss.
    Pension expense on the income statement is classified on a functional basis like
other employee compensation expenses. For a manufacturing company, pension
expense related to production employees is added to inventory and expensed through
cost of sales (cost of goods sold). For other employees, the pension expense is included
in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Therefore, pension expense is typi-
cally not directly reported on the income statement. Rather, extensive disclosures are
included in the notes to the financial statements.

        Extract from Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”
        Retirement benefits
            The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans
        is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of
        the plan assets.
            The calculation of the obligation is performed by a qualified actuary
        using the projected unit credit method and key actuarial assumptions at
        the balance sheet date.
            The income statement expense is allocated between an operating charge
        and net finance income or expense. The operating charge reflects the
        increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from the pension benefit
        earned by active employees in the current period, the costs of administering

                                  tailments or settlements. The net finance income or expense reflects the
                                  interest on the net retirement benefit obligations recognised in the group
                                  balance sheet, based on the discount rate at the start of the year. Actuarial
                                  gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur
                                  and are presented in the group statement of comprehensive income.
                                      The group also operates defined contribution pension plans and the
                                  income statement expense represents the contributions payable for the year.

                             Use information in the excerpts in Exhibit 3 to answer the following questions:

                             1. What type(s) of pension plans does BT have?
                                Solution:
                                Note 3 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” indicates that the
                                company has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.

                             2. What proportion of BT’s total non-current liabilities are related to its retire-
                                ment benefit obligations?
                                Solution:

                          Share-Based Compensation
                          Share-based compensation is intended to align employees’ interests with those of
                          the shareholders and is another common type of deferred compensation. Unlike
                          pension plans, share-based compensation tends to be highly concentrated among
                          more senior-level employees such as executives as well as directors. Both IFRS and
Financial Reporting for Postemployment and Share-Based Compensation Plans                261


US GAAP require a company to disclose in their annual report key elements of man-
agement compensation. Regulators may require additional disclosure. The disclosures
enable analysts to understand the nature and extent of compensation, including the
share-based payment arrangements that existed during the reporting period. In the
United States, these disclosures are typically provided in a company’s proxy statement
that is filed with the SEC. Exhibit 4 shows the disclosure of Apple Inc.’s 2021 Named
Executive Officer Compensation:

Exhibit 4: Apple Inc.’s 2021 Named Executive Officer Compensation

  Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward out-
  standing performance in a straightforward, consistent, and effective way, com-
  mensurate with Apple’s size, performance, and profitability. The compensation
  of our named executive officers has three basic components: annual base salary,
  annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards.



  Annual Base Salary
  Base salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation intended to attract and
  retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive
  officers, the Compensation Committee considers market data provided by its
  independent compensation consultant, internal pay equity, and Apple’s financial
  performance and size relative to peer companies. The annual base salaries for
  our named executive officers did not change for 2021.

  Annual Cash Incentive
  Our annual cash incentive program is a performance-based, at-risk component
  of our named executive officers’ compensation. Variable payouts are designed to
  motivate our named executive officers to deliver strong annual financial results,
  while advancing Apple values and key community initiatives. The financial per-
  formance measures and payout opportunities under the annual incentive program
  did not change for 2021, although the design of the program was enhanced to
  include a modifier based on Apple values and key community initiatives (“ESG
  Modifier”), as described below.
  Long-Term Equity Awards
  We pay for performance and manage Apple for the long-term. Consistent with
  this approach and our guiding compensation principles, the majority of our
  named executive officers’ annual compensation is provided in the form of long-
  term equity incentives that emphasize long-term shareholder value creation and
  the retention of a strong executive leadership team through a balanced mix of
  performance-based and time-based RSU awards.

  Performance-Based RSUs
  RSU awards with performance-based vesting are a substantial, at-risk component
  of our named executive officers’ compensation tied to Apple’s long-term perfor-
  mance. The number of performance-based RSUs that vest depends entirely on
  Apple’s total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&P 500
  (“Relative TSR”) for the applicable performance period. To earn a target award,
  Apple must achieve performance at the 55th percentile of the S&P 500. The
  Compensation Committee chose Relative TSR as it continues to be an objective
  and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of
  other large companies and to align the interests of our named executive officers
  with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value.

                                We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on
                            the change in each company’s stock price during that period, taking into account
                            any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in
                            the stock. A 20-trading-day averaging period is used to determine the beginning
                            and ending stock price values used to calculate the total shareholder return of
                            Apple and the other companies in the S&P 500. This averaging period mitigates
                            the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock
                            price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period. The change
                            in stock price value from the beginning to the end of the period is divided by
                            the beginning stock price value to determine TSR.

                            Time-Based RSUs
                            RSU awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named executive
                            officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and
                            retention of a high-performing executive team over the longer term. Vesting
                            schedules for time-based awards are generally longer than typical peer company
                            practices, as described below.

                            Dividend Equivalents
                            All RSUs granted to our employees in 2021, including our named executive
                            officers, have dividend equivalent rights. The dividend equivalents will only pay
                            out if the time-based vesting and performance conditions have been met for the
                            RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate.

                               Share-based compensation, in addition to theoretically aligning the interests of
                          employees with shareholders, has the advantage of potentially requiring no cash outlay.
                          However, share-based compensation is treated as an expense and thus as a reduction
                          of earnings even when no cash changes hands. In addition to decreasing earnings
                          through compensation expense, share-based compensation has the potential to dilute
                          earnings per share. Share-based compensation arrangements can also be cash-settled,
                          which can result in the accrual of a liability.
                               Although share-based compensation is generally viewed positively as it aligns
                          managers’ interests with those of the shareholders, there are several disadvantages.
                          First is that issuing shares to employees dilutes existing shareholders. Second, the
                          recipient may have limited influence over the company’s market value (especially with
                          respect to the performance of the broad stock market), so share-based compensation
                          does not necessarily provide the desired incentives and may improperly reward or
                          punish employee performance. Another disadvantage is that the increased ownership
                          may lead managers to be risk averse. Fearing a large market value decline (and loss
                          in individual wealth), shareholder managers may seek less risky (and less profitable)
                          projects. An opposite effect, excessive risk taking, can also occur with the awarding of
                          stock options. Options have skewed payouts that reward the upside while the downside
                          is limited to zero; as a result, managers may seek high-risk, high-reward investments.
                               For financial reporting of share-based compensation plans, under both IFRS and
                          US GAAP, companies generally estimate the fair value of the share-based compen-
                          sation at the grant date and recognize it as compensation expense ratably over the
                          plan’s vesting schedule. Any changes in the employee’s stock price after the grant date
                          does not affect the financial reporting. Specifically, the financial reporting depends
                          on the type of plan. Two common forms of equity-settled share-based compensation
                          are stock grants and stock options.
Financial Reporting for Postemployment and Share-Based Compensation Plans                    263



Stock Grants
A company can grant stock to employees outright, with restrictions, or contingent
on performance. For an outright stock grant, compensation expense is reported on
the basis of the fair value of the stock on the grant date—generally the market value
at grant date. Compensation expense is allocated over the period benefited by the
employee’s service, referred to as the service period. The employee service period
is presumed to be the current period unless there are some specific requirements,
such as three years of future service, before the employee is vested (has the right to
receive the compensation).
    Another type of stock award is a restricted stock grant, which requires the employee
to return ownership of those shares to the company if certain conditions are not met.
Common restrictions include the requirements that employees remain with the com-
pany for a specified period or that certain performance goals are met. Compensation
expense for restricted stock grants is measured as the fair value (usually market value)
of the shares issued at the grant date. This compensation expense is allocated over
the employee’s service period.
    Shares granted contingent on meeting performance goals are called performance
shares. The amount of the grant is usually determined by performance measures other
than the change in stock price, such as accounting earnings or return on assets. Basing
the grant on accounting performance addresses employees’ potential concerns that
the stock price is beyond their control and thus should not form the basis for com-
pensation. However, performance shares can potentially have the unintended impact
of providing incentives to manipulate accounting numbers. Compensation expense
is equal to the fair value (usually market value) of the shares issued at the grant date.
This compensation expense is allocated over the employee service period.
    Generally, companies have increased their use of stock grants, particularly restricted
stock grants in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs), and have decreased their use
of stock options to compensate employees over time. Stock grants benefit employees
as they are valuable so long as the employer’s stock price is greater than zero, while
stock options can expire worthless if the employer’s stock price does not exceed the
exercise price.


Stock Options
Like stock grants, compensation expense related to option grants is reported at fair
value under both IFRS and US GAAP. Both require that fair value be estimated using
an appropriate valuation model.
    Whereas the fair value of stock grants is usually the market value at the date of
the grant (adjusted for dividends prior to vesting), the fair value of option grants must
be estimated. Companies cannot rely on market prices of options to measure the fair
value of employee stock options because features of employee stock options typically
differ from traded options. The choice of valuation or option pricing model is one of
the critical elements in estimating fair value. Several models are commonly used, such
as the Black–Scholes option pricing model or a binomial model. Accounting standards
do not prescribe a particular model. Generally, though, the valuation method should
(1) be consistent with fair value measurement, (2) be based on established principles of
financial economic theory, and (3) reflect all substantive characteristics of the award.
    Once a valuation model is selected, a company must determine the inputs to
the model, typically including exercise price, stock price volatility, estimated life of
each award, estimated number of options that will be forfeited, dividend yield, and
the risk-free rate of interest. Some inputs, such as the exercise price, are known at
the time of the grant. Other critical inputs are highly subjective—such as stock price
volatility or the estimated life of stock options—and can greatly change the estimated
264   Learning Module 8                                                          Topics in Long-Term Liabilities and Equity


                          fair value and thus compensation expense. Higher volatility, a longer estimated life,
                          and a higher risk-free interest rate increase the estimated fair value, whereas a higher
                          assumed dividend yield decreases the estimated fair value. Combining different
                          assumptions with alternative valuation models can significantly affect the fair value
                          of employee stock options.

Accounting for Stock Options
In accounting for stock options, the basic requirement is that the value of options
granted to employees as compensation must be expensed ratably over the period
that services are provided. Several important dates affect the accounting, including
the grant date, the vesting date, the exercise date, and the expiration date. The grant
date is the day that options are granted to employees. The service period is usually
the period between the grant date and the vesting date.
    The vesting date is the date that employees can first exercise the stock options.
The vesting can be immediate or over a future period. If the share-based payments
vest immediately (i.e., no further period of service is required), then expense is rec-
ognized on the grant date. If the share-based awards do not vest until a specified
service period is completed, compensation expense is recognized and allocated over
the service period. If the share-based awards are conditional upon the achievement
of a performance condition or a market condition (i.e., a target share price), then
compensation expense is recognized over the estimated service period. The exercise
date is the date when employees exercise the options and convert them to stock.
If the options go unexercised, they may expire at some predetermined future date,
commonly 5 or 10 years from the grant date.
    The grant date is also the date that compensation expense is measured if both
the number of shares and the option price are known. If facts affecting the value of
options granted depend on events after the grant date, then compensation expense
is measured when those facts are known.

                             2. Approximate compensation expense in 2022 and 2023 relating to options
                                already granted.
                                  Solution:
                                  The options already granted will vest over the next 1.9 years. Compensation
                                  expense related to stock options already granted will be USD176 million
                                  (USD335/1.9 years) in 2022 and USD159 million in 2023 (USD335 total less
                                  USD176 expensed in 2022). New options granted in the future will likely
                                  raise the total reported compensation expense.

                              When an option is exercised, the market price of the option at the time of exercise
                          is not relevant. The amount of expense is determined based on the fair value of the
                          option at the grant date. The fair value amount is recognized as compensation expense
                          over the vesting period.
                              The exercise of an option is accounted for in a similar way to the issuance of stock.
                          Upon exercise, the company increases its cash for the exercise price of the option (paid
                          by the option holder) and credits common stock for the par value of the stock issued.
                          Additional paid-in capital is increased by the difference between the par value of the
                          stock and the sum of the fair value of the option at the grant date and the cash received.
                              In sum, the key accounting requirements are as follows:
                             1. Recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of the award. Since
                                no cash is exchanged upon the grant, the offsetting account for the compen-
                                sation expense is additional paid in capital.
                             2. The grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the
                                vesting period.
                             3. Upon exercise, the company increases equity by the fair value of the options
                                on the grant date plus the cash provided by the employee upon exercise.
                              As the option expense is recognized over the relevant vesting period, the impact
                          on the financial statements is to ultimately reduce retained earnings (as with any other
                          expense). The offsetting entry is an increase in paid-in capital. Thus, the recognition
                          of option expense has no net impact on total equity.


                          Other Types of Share-Based Compensation
                          Both stock grants and stock options allow the employee to obtain ownership in the
                          company. Other types of share-based compensation, such as stock appreciation
                          rights (SARs) or phantom stock, compensate an employee on the basis of changes
                          in the value of shares without requiring the employee to hold the shares. These are
                          referred to as cash-settled share-based compensation. With SARs, an employee’s
                          compensation is based on increases in a company’s share price. Like other forms of
                          share-based compensation, SARs serve to motivate employees and align their interests
                          with shareholders. The following are two additional advantages of SARs:
                              ■    The potential for risk aversion is limited because employees have limited
                                   downside risk and unlimited upside potential similar to employee stock
                                   options.
                              ■    Shareholder ownership is not diluted.

    Similar to other share-based compensation, SARs are valued at fair value and
compensation expense is allocated over the service period of the employee. While
phantom share plans are similar to other types of share-based compensation, they
differ somewhat because compensation is based on the performance of hypothetical
stock rather than the company’s actual stock. Unlike SARs, phantom shares can be
used by private companies or business units within a company that are not publicly
traded or by highly illiquid companies.




PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE
                                                                                             4
               describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures
               relating to long-term liabilities and share-based compensation

This lesson examines the presentation and disclosure requirements for leases, post-
retirement benefits, and share-based compensation. These disclosures are typically
included as notes to the financial statements.


Presentation and Disclosure of Leases
Both IFRS and US GAAP indicate that the objective of lease disclosure is to provide
the user of the financial statement with information to assess the amount, timing and
uncertainty of cash flows associated with leases.
    The non-current portion of the balance sheet will typically contain a “right of use”
asset and the non-current (long-term) liabilities section will typically show the lease
liability. However, depending on the size of leased assets and lease obligations, some
companies may not have discrete lease line items on the balance sheet and instead will
report leases in “Other assets” or “Other liabilities.” In addition to amounts reported
on the balance sheet, both lessees and lessors must disclose quantitative and quali-
tative information about its leases, significant judgments made to comply with lease
accounting requirements and the amounts recognized in the financial statements
relating to those leases and their location on the statements.


Lessee Disclosure
Specifically, as indicated in IFRS 16, lessee disclosures must include the following
amounts for the current reporting period:
    ■   the carrying amount of right of use assets and the end of the reporting
        period by class of underlying asset;
    ■   total cash outflow for leases;
    ■   interest expense on lease liabilities;
    ■   depreciation charges for right-of-use assets by class of underlying asset; and
    ■   additions to right of use assets.
    In addition, lessees should disclose a maturity analysis of lease liabilities (sepa-
rately from the maturity analysis of other financial liabilities like bonds and loans) and
additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing activity to enable
users of financial statements to assess the nature of the lessee’s leasing activities and
future cash outflows. This analysis should include the following:
    ■   the nature of the lessee’s leasing activities;

                              ■   future cash outflows to which the lessee is potentially exposed that are not
                                  reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities;
                              ■   restrictions or covenants imposed by leases; and
                              ■   sale and leaseback transactions.
                              Exhibit 7 is a reproduction of Apple’s Corp’s lease disclosure in its notes to finan-
                          cial statements.

                             Note 6 - Leases
                             The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities,
                             including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases
                             typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain mul-
                             tiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The
                             Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and nonlease compo-
                             nents. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease
                             components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data
                             center facilities.
                                 Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable,
                             and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the
                             underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the
                             Company’s operating leases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020,
                             respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s
                             leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent
                             expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease account-
                             ing standards, was $1.3 billion in 2019.
                                 The Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments
                             related to operating leases in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities
                             involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities
                             were $3.3 billion for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of
                             adopting FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.

       The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of both
   September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 was 2.0%. The discount rates are
   generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as
   the discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
       As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $1.1 billion of future payments
   under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that
   had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2023,
   with lease terms ranging from 3 years to 20 years.

Lessor Disclosure
IFRS 16 specifies different disclosure requirements for lessors. Similar to lessees,
lessors must disclose information (either in the notes or the financial statements)
that enables users of financial statements to assess the effect that leases have on the
financial position, performance, and cash flows of the lessor. At a minimum, lessors
should disclose:
    ■   for finance leases,
    ■   the amount of selling profit or loss; and
    ■   finance income on the net investment in the lease; and income relating to
        variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease;
    ■   for operating leases, lease income with separate disclosure for income relat-
        ing to variable lease payments no based on an index or rate.
    In addition, a lessor must provide additional qualitative and quantitative informa-
tion about its leasing activities, including information to help users assess the nature
of the lessor’s leasing activities and how the lessor manages risk associated with any
rights it retains in the underlying leased assets.
    For finance leases, lessors should provide a qualitative and quantitative explana-
tion of significant changes in the carrying amount of the net investment, along with
a maturity analysis of the lease payments receivable showing undiscounted lease
payments to be received on an annual basis for a minimum of each of the first five
years and a total amount for any remaining years

                              For operating leases, a lessor should disclose disaggregated information about
                          each class of property, plant, and equipment subject to operating leases and disclose
                          a maturity analysis of lease payments showing the undiscounted lease payments to be
                          received on an annual basis for a minimum of each of the first five years and a total
                          of the amounts for the remaining years.


                          Presentation and Disclosure of Postemployment Plans
                          Disclosures for defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans are typically
                          included as a note to the financial statements, with disclosures for defined benefit plans
                          being far more extensive. For defined contribution plans, International Accounting
                          Standard 19 (IAS 19) requires issuers to simply disclose the amount recognized on
                          the income statement during the period. Regulators can require more extensive dis-
                          closures. For example, the US SEC requires issuers to file a separate annual report on
                          Form 11-K for employee benefit plans that includes audited plan financial statements
                          and descriptions of the plan’s structure and holdings.
                              IAS 19 defines the following objectives for issuers’ disclosures of their defined
                          benefit pension plans:
                              ■   explain the characteristics of its defined benefit plans and risks associated
                                  with them;
                              ■   identify and explain the amounts in its financial statements arising from its
                                  defined benefit plans (i.e., the net pension asset or liability); and
                              ■   describe how its defined benefit plans may affect the amount, timing and
                                  uncertainty of the entity’s future cash flows.
                              While IAS 19 is principles-based, giving issuers discretion in how best to achieve
                          the disclosure objectives, it does give several specific prescriptions, requiring issuers
                          to make disclosures, such as the following:
                              ■   the nature of benefits provided, the regulatory framework in which the plan

 Exhibit 8: Roche AG’s Pensions and Other Postemployment Benefits



   Note 26. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
   [Roche AG’s] (“Group”) objective is to provide attractive and competitive
   post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same time ensuring that
   the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts
   on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most employees are covered by
   pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies
   according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and market practice in the
   countries in which the employees are employed. Post-employment benefit plans
   are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
   contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and
   will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
   All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’

   Defined contribution plans
   Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by
   the Group to funds administered by third parties. The Group’s expenses for these
   plans were CHF 419 million (2020: CHF 409 million). No assets or liabilities
   are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from
   regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’
   wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined
   contribution plan is the US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.

   Defined benefit plans
   Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded
   by payments from Group companies and by employees. In some cases, notably
   for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and
   the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial
   resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body, such as a
   Board of Trustees, which is typically composed of both employee and employer
   representatives. Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations using
   independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations are
   prepared in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s
   financial statements. The Group’s major pension plans are located in Switzerland,
   the US and Germany, which in total account for 85% of the Group’s defined
   benefit obligation (2020: 85%).

Presentation and Disclosure of Share-Based Compensation
Companies are required to provide disclosures about their share-based compensation
programs that enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature and
extent of share-based payment arrangements, including the current expected future
cash flows and expenses relating to those plans. Issuers typically include these disclo-
sures in a note to the financial statements. As specified in IFRS 2, required disclosures
include the following:
   ■   A description of each type of share-based payment arrangement, including
       its general terms and conditions, such as vesting requirements, the maxi-
       mum term of options granted and the method of settlement (i.e., cash or
       equity)
   ■   Details about the number and weighted average exercises price of options,
       including:

       ●   the number outstanding at the beginning of the period,
       ●   granted during the period,
       ●   forfeited during the period,
       ●   exercised during the period,
       ●   expired during the period,
       ●   outstanding at the end of the period, and
       ●   exercisable at the end of the period.
   ■   For other equity instruments granted during the period (i.e., other than
       share options), the number and weighted average fair value of those equity
       instruments at the measurement date, and information on how that fair
       value was measured.
    Exhibit 9 is an excerpt of Apple Inc.’s note disclosure for its share-based compen-
sation, which is composed of grants of RSUs and an employee stock purchase plan.
Note that Apple Inc.’s share price at the last balance sheet date (25 September 2021)
was USD146.10, up significantly over the prior three years, which is evident in the
increase in the fair value of RSU grants. Second, Apple Inc.’s primary share-based
compensation plan is named the “2014 Employee Stock Plan.” The name of these
plans usually refers to the date it was approved by shareholders. A new plan, with
a new date name, can be created at the discretion of the board and submitted to a
shareholder vote; the company does not necessarily have to wait until all stock grants
under the prior plan have been made, however. Some issuers will have several active
stock compensation plans outstanding.

   2014 Employee Stock Plan
   The 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan
   that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive
   officers, and permits the granting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock grants,
   performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well
   as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over
   four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in
   shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted
   under the 2014 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the
   plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and

                             shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of
                             shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the
                             number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under the 2014
                             Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs
                             to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are
                             subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying
                             RSUs. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 760 million shares were reserved
                             for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards
                             under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise
                             terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will
                             also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan.

                             Employee Stock Purchase Plan
                             The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-ap-
                             proved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to
                             purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price
                             equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the begin-
                             ning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions
                             under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and
                             employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar
                             year. As of September 25, 2021, approximately 96 million shares were reserved
                             for future issuance under the Purchase Plan.

                            PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                          1. Which of the following is a potential drawback of compensating employees with
                             stock options?
                             A. The grant may make employees adverse to risk.

                             B. The grant may make employees seek more risk.

                             C. Both of the above are potential drawbacks.:

                          2. Which of the following is typically an objective of a share-based compensation
                             plan?
                             A. Attracting new employees

                             B. Maximizing executive compensation

                             C. Alignment of employees’ interest with those of management

                          3. Which of the following statements is true?
                             A. Share-based compensation does not have to be treated as an expense, when
                                no cash is exchanged.

                             B. Share-based compensation programs can take a variety of forms, including
                                those that are equity-settled and those that are cash settled.

                             C. Employees will receive a benefit of the stock option as long as they work
                                long enough for the option to vest.

                          4. Which of the following is a difference between a stock grant and a stock option
                             grant?
                             A. Whereas the fair value of stock grants is usually based on the market value
                                at the date of the grant, the fair value of option grants must be estimated.

                             B. Companies account for stock grants by allocating compensation expense
                                over the employee service period, whereas compensation expense for stock
                                options is expensed immediately.

                             C. Compensation expense is determined based on the market value of a share
                                of stock on the grant date, whereas the measurement date for the value of an
                                option is when the employee exercises the option.

                          5. Assume ABC Company, a fictional company provides the following disclosure
                             about its stock compensation plans:
                             “The average fair value of shares granted was USD20.86, USD16.42, and
                             USD17.80 in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.” If the company granted 18,000
                             shares, with a three-year vesting period in 2021, what is the annual compensation
                             expense for the 2021 shares granted?
                             A. USD125,160

                             B. USD339,480

   nized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards
   granted under our plan. We expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average
   period of 3.2 years as stock-based compensation expense. What is the expected
   compensation expense in 2025?
   A. USD39 million

   B. USD197 million

   C. USD630 million

7. Beginning with fiscal year 2019, for leases with a term longer than one year, les-
   sees report a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet:
   A. only for finance leases.

   B. only for operating leases.

   C. for both finance and operating leases.

8. For a lessor, the leased asset appears on the balance sheet and continues to be
   depreciated when the lease is classified as:
   A. a finance lease.

   B. a sales-type lease.

   C. an operating lease.

9. Under US GAAP, a lessor’s reported revenues at lease inception will be highest if
   the lease is classified as:
   A. a sales-type lease.

   B. an operating lease.

   C. a direct financing lease.

10. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, a lessor in an operating lease recognizes:
   A. selling profit at lease inception.

   B. a lease asset comprising the lease receivable and relevant residual value at
      lease inception.

   C. lease receipts as income and related costs, including depreciation, as
      expenses over the lease term.

11. Compared with a finance lease, an operating lease:
   A. is similar to renting an asset.

   B. is equivalent to the purchase of an asset.

   C. has a term for the majority of the economic life of the leased asset.

                              C. increasing the balance of the lease liability by a portion of the lease
                                 payment.

                          13. A company enters into a finance lease agreement to acquire the use of an asset for
                              three years with lease payments of EUR19,000,000 starting next year. The leased
                              asset has a fair market value of EUR49,000,000 and the present value of the lease
                              payments is EUR47,250,188. Based on this information, the value of the lease
                              liability reported on the company’s balance sheet at lease inception is closest to:
                              A. EUR47,250,188.

                              B. EUR49,000,000.

                              pension obligation is EUR10 million and pension assets are EUR9 million. Under
                              either IFRS or US GAAP, the reporting on the balance sheet would be closest to
                              which of the following?
                              A. EUR10 million is shown as a liability, and EUR9 million appears as an asset.

                              B. EUR1 million is shown as a net pension obligation.

                              C. Pension assets and obligations are not required to be shown on the balance

                              defined benefit plan:

                          Fair value of fund’s assets                                       USD1,500,000,000

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. Stock option grants may lead managers to be either risk adverse or
   have the opposite effect (i.e., encourage excessive risk taking). Therefore, B and C
   are both potential drawbacks.

2. The correct answer is A. The objectives of employee compensation plans include
   attracting new employees, retaining and motivating existing employees and
   aligning employee interests with those of shareholders. Answer B, maximizing
   executive compensation is not typically an objective of a share-based compensa-
   tion programs. Answer C is not correct because an objective is to align employee
   interests with shareholders, not necessarily management.

3. The correct answer is B. There are numerous types of share-based compensation
   programs; some result in the issuance of shares to employees, and others result
   in a cash payment based on the value of company shares. Answer A is not correct
   because even if no cash is exchanged at the time of grant, the compensation ex-
   pense is recognized based on the fair value of the grant. Answer C is not correct
   because, in some cases, employees may not receive the benefit of a stock option.
   For example, if the stock option expires when the exercise price exceeds the mar-
   ket value of the company’s stock, the recipient may not benefit from the grant.

4. A is correct. The compensation for a stock grant is based on the market value at
   the date of the stock grant. For a stock option, the value is not definitively known
   and must be estimated. Answer B is not correct because companies account for
   both stock grants and option grants by allocating the value of the grant over the
   service period (often the vesting period). Answer C is not correct because for
   both a share grant and an option grant, the value of the grant is determined based
   on the date of the grant.

5. The correct answer is A, calculated as follows: 18,000 shares × by average fair
   value at grant date of USD20.86 = USD375,480 total compensation. Divide this
   amount by the three-year vesting period, and the result is USD125,160 annual
   compensation expense.

6. The correct answer is A. USD39 million calculated as follows: USD630 mil-
   lion/3.2 years = USD197 million per year for years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The
   amount remaining in 2025 would be USD39 million: USD630 − USD197 −
   USD197 − USD197 = USD39 million.

7. C is correct. Beginning with fiscal year 2019, lessees report a right-of-use asset
   and a lease liability for all leases longer than one year. An exception under IFRS
   exists for leases when the underlying asset is of low value.

8. C is correct. When a lease is classified as an operating lease, the underlying asset
   remains on the lessor’s balance sheet. The lessor will record a depreciation ex-
   pense that reduces the asset’s value over time.

9. A is correct. A sales-type lease treats the lease as a sale of the asset, and reve-
   nue is recorded at the time of sale equal to the value of the leased asset. Under
   a direct financing lease, only interest income is reported as earned. Under an
   operating lease, revenue from lease receipts is reported when collected.

10. C is correct. Lessor accounting for an operating lease under US GAAP is simi-
    lar to that under IFRS: Over the lease term, the lessor recognizes lease receipts
280   Learning Module 8                                                    Topics in Long-Term Liabilities and Equity


                             as income and recognizes related costs, including depreciation of the leased
                             asset, as expenses. Under IFRS, at inception of a finance lease—not an operating
                             lease—the lessor derecognizes the underlying leased asset and recognizes a lease
                             asset comprising the lease receivable and relevant residual value. Further, an
                             IFRS-reporting lessor will recognize selling profit at the beginning of all leases
                             that are not classified as operating leases. In contrast, a US GAAP–reporting
                             lessor will recognize selling profit only on sales-type leases at the beginning of
                             the lease term.

                          11. A is correct. An operating lease is an agreement that allows the lessee to use an
                              asset for a period of time. Thus, an operating lease is similar to renting an asset,
                              whereas a finance lease is equivalent to the purchase of an asset by the lessee that
                              is directly financed by the lessor.

                          12. B is correct. A lessee’s accounting for a long-term finance lease under US
                              GAAP and after lease inception includes recording depreciation expense on the
                              right-of-use asset, recognizing interest expense on the lease liability, and reduc-
                              ing the balance of the lease liability for the portion of the lease payments that
                              represents repayment of the lease liability. A lessee’s accounting for an operating
                              lease under US GAAP and after lease inception will recognize a single lease ex-
                              pense, which is a straight-line allocation of the cost of the lease over its term.

                          13. A is correct. Under the revised reporting standards under IFRS and US GAAP,
                              a lessee must recognize an asset and a lease liability at inception of each of its
                              leases (with an exception for short-term leases). The lessee reports a right-of-use
                              (ROU) asset and a lease liability, calculated essentially as the present value of
                              fixed lease payments, on its balance sheet. Thus, at lease inception, the company
                              will record a lease liability on the balance sheet of EUR47,250,188.

                          14. B is correct. The company will report a net pension obligation of EUR1 mil-
                              lion equal to the pension obligation (EUR10 million) less the plan assets (EUR9
                              million).

                          15. A is correct. A company that offers a defined benefit plan makes payments into
                              a pension fund and the retirees are paid from the fund. The payments that a
                              company makes into the fund are invested until they are needed to pay retir-
                              ees. If the fair value of the fund’s assets is higher than the present value of the

              1           INTRODUCTION
                          Differences between tax laws and financial accounting standards result in differences
                          between accounting profit (i.e., income before taxes on the income statement) and
                          taxable income, or income computed under the prevailing tax laws in a given juris-
                          diction. These differences can be temporary or permanent. Temporary differences
                          result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and are important
                          for capturing the income tax effects of all current period activities, even if tax con-
                          sequences occur in the future. Current and deferred income tax expenses are used
                          to calculate the effective tax rate, which is commonly used by analysts in estimating
                          after-tax profitability measures like free cash flow. Given temporary and permanent
                          differences, the effective tax rate typically differs from the statutory and cash tax rates
                          for an issuer. Company disclosures of income tax related information in the notes to
                          financial statements is typically one of the most extensive note disclosures.

                                 ■   Accounting profit is reported on a company’s income state-
                                     ment in accordance with prevailing accounting standards and
                                     does not include a provision for income tax expense.
                                 ■   A company’s taxable income is its income subject to income taxes
                                     under the tax laws of the relevant jurisdiction and is the basis for its
                                     income tax payable (a liability), which appears on its balance sheet.
                                 ■   Taxable and deductible temporary differences reverse in future periods
                                     while permanent differences do not.
                                 ■   Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences in
                                     accounting profit and taxable income.
                                 ■   Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been paid but have not
                                     yet been recognized on the income statement, and deferred tax liabil-
                                     ities occur when financial accounting income tax expense is greater
                                     than regulatory income tax expense.
                                 ■   The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are added to income
                                     tax payable to determine the company’s income tax expense as it is
                                     reported on the income statement.
                                 ■   Income taxes payable are primarily determined by the geographic
                                     composition of taxable income and the tax rates in each jurisdiction.
                                 ■   Three types of tax rates are relevant to analysts: the statutory tax rate,
                                     the effective tax rate, and the cash tax rate.
                                 ■   The notes in the financial statements disclose a reconciliation of the
                                     statutory tax rate to the effective rate and identify the items that sig-
                                     nificantly contribute to a temporarily high or low effective tax rate.
                                 ■   Companies present and disclose income tax–related information
                                     through income statements, balance sheets, and income tax note
                                     disclosures.
                                 ■   Companies will disclose how the income tax provision was derived
                                     from the US federal statutory rate.
                                 ■   In the income tax note disclosure, companies will provide detailed
                                     information about the derivation of the deferred tax assets and
                                     deferred tax liabilities.

                contrast accounting profit, taxable income, taxes payable, and
                income tax expense and temporary versus permanent differences
                between accounting profit and taxable income

A company’s accounting profit is reported on its income statement in accordance
with prevailing accounting standards. Accounting profit (also referred to as income
before taxes or pretax income) does not include a provision for income tax expense.1
A company’s taxable income is its income subject to income taxes under the tax laws
of the relevant jurisdiction. A company’s taxable income is the basis for its income
tax payable (a liability) or recoverable (an asset), which appears on its balance sheet.
Income tax paid in a period is the cash amount paid for income and reduces the
income tax payable.
    The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount at which the asset or liability
is valued for tax purposes, whereas the carrying amount is the amount at which the
asset or liability is recorded in the financial statements.2 The tax bases and carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities can differ based on differences in accounting standards
and the relevant tax laws. Common differences are as follows:
    ■   Revenues and expenses may be recognized in one period for accounting
        purposes and a different period for tax purposes.
    ■   Specific revenues and expenses may be either recognized for accounting
        purposes and not at all for tax purposes, or vice versa.
    ■   The deductibility of gains and losses of assets and liabilities may vary for
        accounting and income tax purposes.
    ■   Subject to tax rules, tax losses in prior years might be used to reduce taxable
        income in later years, resulting in differences in accounting and taxable
        income (tax loss carryforward).
    ■   Adjustments of reported financial data from prior years might not be rec-
        ognized equally for accounting and tax purposes or might be recognized in
        different periods.
    A common example is accelerated depreciation of an asset for tax reporting (to
increase expense and lower tax payments in the early years) while using the straight-line
depreciation method on the financial statements. Although different on a year-to-year
basis (e.g., depreciation of 10 percent on a straight-line basis may be used for accounting
purposes, whereas 50 percent might be allowed for tax purposes in the first year) both
approaches allow for the total cost of the asset to be depreciated over its useful life.
    Differences between the tax base and carrying amount of liabilities (and, by
extension, between taxable income and accounting profit) can either be temporary
or permanent. Temporary differences, like the aforementioned accelerated versus
straight-line depreciation example, reverse in future periods, whereas permanent
differences do not.

2 The terms “tax base” and “tax basis” are interchangeable. “Tax basis” is more commonly used in the
United States. Similarly, “carrying amount” and “book value” refer to the same concept.

                          Taxable Temporary Differences
                          Temporary differences are further divided into two categories, namely taxable tem-
                          porary differences and deductible temporary differences. Taxable temporary dif-
                          ferences result from the carrying amount of an asset exceeding its tax base (like the
                          aforementioned accelerated depreciation example at the end of Year 1) or when the
                          tax base of a liability exceeds its carrying amount. Taxable temporary differences
                          result in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities.


                          Deductible Temporary Differences
                          Deductible temporary differences are temporary differences that result in a reduc-
                          tion or deduction of taxable income in a future period when the balance sheet item
                          is recovered or settled. Deductible temporary differences result in a deferred tax
                          asset when the tax base of an asset exceeds its carrying amount and, in the case of a
                          liability, when the carrying amount of the liability exceeds its tax base. The recognition
                          of a deferred tax asset is allowed only to the extent there is a reasonable expectation
                          of future profits against which the asset or liability (that gave rise to the deferred tax
                          asset) can be recovered or settled.
                              To determine the probability of sufficient future profits for utilization, one must
                          consider the following: (1) sufficient taxable temporary differences must exist that
                          are related to the same tax authority and the same taxable entity; and (2) the taxable
                          temporary differences that are expected to reverse in the same periods as expected
                          for the reversal of the deductible temporary differences.


                          Taxable and Deductible Temporary Differences
                          Exhibit 1 summarizes how differences between the tax bases and carrying amounts
                          of assets and liabilities give rise to deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.

                                                                                         Results in Deferred Tax

                          Asset                     Carrying amount < tax base              Deferred tax asset

                          Liability                 Carrying amount < tax base            Deferred tax liability

                          Example 1 and 2 illustrate the difference in the tax base and carrying amount of the
                          assets and liabilities, whether they are temporary or permanent differences, and
                          whether a deferred tax asset or liability will be recognized.

      1. Dividends receivable: As a result of non-taxability, the carrying
         amount equals the tax base of dividends receivable. This constitutes
         a permanent difference and will not result in the recognition of any
         deferred tax asset or liability. A temporary difference constitutes a dif-
         ference that will, at some future date, be reversed. Although the timing
         of recognition is different for tax and accounting purposes, in the end
         the full carrying amount will be expensed/recognized as income. A
         permanent difference will never be reversed. Based on tax legislation,
         dividends from a subsidiary are not recognized as income. Therefore,
         no amount will be reflected as dividend income when calculating the
         taxable income, and the tax base of dividends receivable must be the
         total amount received, namely EUR1,000,000. The taxable income and
         accounting profit will permanently differ with the amount of dividends
         receivable, even on future financial statements as an effect on the
         retained earnings reflected on the balance sheet.
      2. Development costs: The difference between the carrying amount and
         tax base is a temporary difference that, in the future, will reverse. In
         this fiscal year, it will result in a deferred tax liability.
      3. Research costs: The difference between the carrying amount and tax
         base is a temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset.
         Remember that a deferred tax asset arises because of an excess
         amount paid for taxes (when taxable income is greater than account-
         ing profit), which is expected to be recovered from future operations.
         Based on accounting principles, the full amount was deducted result-
         ing in a lower accounting profit, while the taxable income by implica-
         tion, should be greater because of the lower amount expensed.
      4. Accounts receivable: The difference between the carrying amount and
         tax base of the asset is a temporary difference that will result in a
         deferred tax liability.

                                 1. Donations: It was assumed that tax legislation does not allow dona-
                                    tions to be deducted for tax purposes. No temporary difference results
                                    from donations, and thus a deferred tax asset or liability will not be
                                    recognized. This constitutes a permanent difference.
                                 2. Interest received in advance: Interest received in advance results in a
                                    temporary difference that gives rise to a deferred tax asset. A deferred
                                    tax asset arises because of an excess amount paid for taxes (when tax-
                                    able income is greater than accounting profit), which is expected to be
                                    recovered from future operations.
                                 3. Rent received in advance: The difference between the carrying amount
                                    and tax base is a temporary difference that leads to the recognition of
                                    a deferred tax asset.
                                 4. Loan: There are no temporary differences, as a result of the loan or
                                    interest paid, and thus no deferred tax item is recognized.



                          Permanent Differences
                          Permanent differences are differences between tax laws and accounting standards
                          that will not be reversed at some future date. Because they will not be reversed at a
                          future date, these differences do not give rise to deferred tax. These items typically
                          include the following:
                             ■   income or expense items not allowed by tax legislation, such as penalties
                                 and fines that are considered expenses for financial reporting purposes, but
                                 are not deductible for tax purposes; and
                             ■   tax credits for some expenditures that directly reduce taxes. An example is
                                 tax credits provided by tax authorities to encourage the purchase of solar
                                 power or an electric vehicle.
                              Because no deferred tax item is created for permanent differences, all permanent
                          differences result in a difference between the company’s tax rate and its statutory
                          corporate income tax rate.

Tax Expense
A company’s tax expense or its provision for income taxes, appears on its income
statement and is an aggregate of its income tax payable (or recoverable in the case
of a tax benefit) and any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. This approach,
rather than simply reporting income taxes paid, follows the matching principle by
reporting the tax consequences of all current period activities.

QUESTION SET


   1. When accounting standards require recognition of an expense that
      is not permitted under tax laws, the result is a:
       A. deferred tax liability.
       B. temporary difference.
       C. permanent difference.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Accounting items that are not deductible for tax purposes will
      not be reversed and thus result in permanent differences.

   2. When certain expenditures result in tax credits that directly reduce taxes,
      the company will most likely record:
       A. a deferred tax asset.
       B. a deferred tax liability.
       C. no deferred tax asset or liability.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Tax credits that directly reduce taxes are a permanent differ-
      ence, and permanent differences do not give rise to deferred tax.

   3. In early 2018, Sanborn Company must pay the tax authority EUR37,000 on
      the income it earned in 2017. This amount was most likely recorded on the
      company’s 31 December 2017 financial statements as:
       A. taxes payable.
       B. income tax expense.
       C. a deferred tax liability.
      Solution:
      A is correct. The taxes a company must pay in the immediate future are
      taxes payable.




DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

288   Learning Module 9                                                                      Analysis of Income Taxes


                          Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences in accounting profit
                          and taxable income. Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been paid (or often
                          the carrying forward of losses from previous periods) but have not yet been recognized
                          on the income statement. Deferred tax liabilities occur when financial accounting
                          income tax expense is greater than regulatory income tax expense. At the end of each
                          reporting period, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recalculated by comparing the
                          tax bases and carrying amounts of the balance sheet items. The changes in deferred
                          tax assets and liabilities are added to income tax payable to determine the company’s
                          income tax expense (or credit) as it is reported on the income statement.
                              If statutory tax rates change, the recorded value of a deferred tax asset or deferred
                          tax liability would also change. For example, assume a tax authority reduces the statu-
                          tory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Because the future tax benefit
                          would be reduced, the recorded value of a deferred tax asset would decrease. Similarly,
                          because the amount of a future tax obligation decreases, the value of a corresponding
                          deferred tax liability would also decrease.


                          Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets
                          Assume Pinto Construction (a hypothetical company) depreciates equipment on a
                          straight-line basis of 10 percent per year. The tax authorities allow depreciation of 15
                          percent per year. At the end of the fiscal year, the carrying amount of the equipment
                          for accounting purposes would be greater than the tax base of the equipment thus
                          resulting in a temporary difference. A deferred tax asset may be created only if the
                          company expects to be able to realize the economic benefit of the deferred tax asset
                          in the future. In this example, the equipment is used in the core business of Pinto
                          Construction. If the company is a going concern and has stable earnings, there should
                          be no doubt that future economic benefits will result from the equipment, and it would
                          be appropriate to create the deferred tax item.
                              If, however, it were doubtful that future economic benefits will be realized from a
                          temporary difference (i.e., if Pinto Construction was being liquidated), the temporary
                          difference will not lead to recognition of a deferred tax asset. If a deferred tax asset
                          was recognized previously, but there was sufficient doubt about the economic benefits
                          being realized, then, under IFRS, an existing deferred tax asset would be reversed.
                          Under US GAAP, a valuation allowance would be established to reduce the amount
                          of the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In
                          assessing future economic benefits, much is left to the discretion of management in
                          assessing the temporary differences and the issue of future economic benefits.

       The financial performance and accounting profit of Reston Partners on
   this income statement is based on accounting principles appropriate for the
   jurisdiction in which Reston Partners operates. The principles used to calculate
   accounting profit (profit before tax) may differ from the principles applied for
   tax purposes (the calculation of taxable income). For illustrative purposes, how-
   ever, assume that all income and expenses on the income statement are treated
   identically for tax and accounting purposes except depreciation.
       The depreciation is related to equipment owned by Reston Partners. For
   simplicity, assume that the equipment was purchased at the beginning of Year 1.
   Depreciation should thus be calculated and expensed for the full year. Assume
   that accounting standards permit equipment to be depreciated on a straight-
   line basis over a 10-year period, whereas the tax standards in the jurisdiction
   specify that equipment should be depreciated on a straight-line basis over a
   seven-year period. For simplicity, assume a salvage value of GBP0 at the end of
   the equipment’s useful life. Both methods will result in the full depreciation of
   the asset over the respective tax or accounting life.
       The equipment was originally purchased for GBP20,000. In accordance with
   accounting standards, over the next 10 years the company will recognize annual
   depreciation of GBP2,000 (GBP20,000 ÷ 10) as an expense on its income state-
   ment and for the determination of accounting profit. For tax purposes, however,
   the company will recognize GBP2,857 (GBP20,000 ÷ 7) in depreciation each year.
   Each fiscal year the depreciation expense related to the use of the equipment
   will, therefore, differ for tax and accounting purposes (tax base vs. carrying
   amount), resulting in a difference between accounting profit and taxable income.
       The previous income statement reflects accounting profit (depreciation at
   GBP2,000 per year). Exhibit 5 shows the taxable income for each fiscal year.

                              At each balance sheet date, the tax base and carrying amount of all assets and
                          liabilities must be determined. The income tax payable by Reston Partners will
                          be based on the taxable income of each fiscal year. If a tax rate of 30 percent is
                          assumed, then the income taxes payable for years 1, 2, and 3 are GBP1,153 (30%
                          × 3,843), GBP4,327 (30% × 14,423), and GBP7,753 (30% × 25,843), respectively.
                              Remember, though, that if the tax obligation is calculated based on account-
                          ing profits, it will differ because of the differences between the tax base and the
                          carrying amount of equipment. The difference in each fiscal year is reflected
                          in the table above. In each fiscal year the carrying amount of the equipment
                          exceeds its tax base. For tax purposes, therefore, the asset tax base is less than
                          its carrying value under financial accounting principles. The difference results
                          in a deferred tax liability as shown in Exhibit 7.

                              The comparison of the tax base and carrying amount of equipment shows
                          what the deferred tax liability should be on a particular balance sheet date. In
                          each fiscal year, only the change in the deferred tax liability should be included
                          in the calculation of the income tax expense reported on the income statement
                          prepared for accounting purposes.
                              On the income statement, the company’s income tax expense will be the sum
                          of change in the deferred tax liability and the income tax payable.

QUESTION SET


   1. Using the straight-line method of depreciation for reporting pur-
      poses and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes would most likely result
      in a:
       A. deferred tax asset.
       B. valuation allowance.
       C. temporary difference.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Because the differences between tax and financial accounting
      will correct over time, the resulting deferred tax liability, for which the ex-
      pense was charged to the income statement but the tax authority has not yet
292   Learning Module 9                                                                   Analysis of Income Taxes


                             been paid, will be a temporary difference. A valuation allowance would only
                             arise if there was doubt over the company’s ability to earn sufficient income
                             in the future to require paying the tax.

                          2. Income tax expense reported on a company’s income statement equals taxes
                             payable, plus the net increase in:
                             A. deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
                             B. deferred tax assets, less the net increase in deferred tax liabilities.
                              C. deferred tax liabilities, less the net increase in deferred tax assets.
                             Solution:
                             C is correct. Higher reported tax expense relative to taxes paid will increase
                             the deferred tax liability, whereas lower reported tax expense relative to
                             taxes paid increases the deferred tax asset.

                          3. Analysts should treat deferred tax liabilities that are expected to reverse as:
                             A. equity.
                             B. liabilities.
                              C. neither liabilities nor equity.
                             Solution:
                             B is correct. If the liability is expected to reverse (and thus require a cash tax
                             payment) the deferred tax represents a future liability.

                          4. When accounting standards require an asset to be expensed immediately
                             but tax rules require the item to be capitalized and amortized, the company
                             will most likely record:
                             A. a deferred tax asset.
                             B. a deferred tax liability.
                              C. no deferred tax asset or liability.
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. The capitalization will result in an asset with a positive tax base
                             and zero carrying value. The amortization means the difference is tem-
                             porary. Because there is a temporary difference on an asset resulting in a
                             higher tax base than carrying value, a deferred tax asset is created.

                          5. A company incurs a capital expenditure that may be amortized over five
                             years for accounting purposes, but over four years for tax purposes. The
                             company will most likely record:
                             A. a deferred tax asset.
                             B. a deferred tax liability.
                              C. no deferred tax asset or liability.
                             Solution:
                             B is correct. The difference is temporary, and the tax base will be lower (be-
                             cause of more rapid amortization) than the carrying value of the asset. The
                             result will be a deferred tax liability.

   6. A company receives advance payments from customers that are immedi-
      ately taxable but will not be recognized for accounting purposes until the
      company fulfills its obligation. The company will most likely record:
       A. a deferred tax asset.
       B. a deferred tax liability.
       C. no deferred tax asset or liability.
      Solution:
      A is correct. The advances represent a liability for the company. The carry-
      ing value of the liability exceeds the tax base (which is now zero). A deferred
      tax asset arises when the carrying value of a liability exceeds its tax base.

   7. A reduction in the statutory tax rate would most likely benefit the
      company’s:
       A. income statement and balance sheet.
       B. income statement but not the balance sheet.
       C. balance sheet but not the income statement.
      Solution:
      A is correct. A lower tax rate would increase net income on the income
      statement, and because the company has a net deferred tax liability, the net
      liability position on the balance sheet would also improve (be smaller).

                            8. If the valuation allowance had been the same in Year 3 as it was in Year 2,
                               the company would have reported USD115 higher:

                                  C. income tax expense.
                                 Solution:
                                 C is correct. The reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a corre-
                                 sponding reduction in the income tax provision.

                            9. Relative to the provision for income taxes in Year 3, the company’s cash tax
                               payments were:
                                 A. lower.
                                 B. higher.
                                  C. the same.
                                 Solution:
                                 B is correct. The net deferred tax liability was smaller in Year 3 than it was
                                 in Year 2, indicating that in addition to meeting the tax payments provided
                                 for in Year 3 the company also paid taxes that had been deferred in prior
                                 periods.




              4           CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES

                                         calculate, interpret, and contrast an issuer’s effective tax rate,
                                         statutory tax rate, and cash tax rate

                          Income taxes payable are primarily determined by the geographic composition of
                          taxable income and the tax rates in each jurisdiction but can also be influenced by
                          the nature of a business. Some companies benefit from special tax treatment—for
                          example, from R&D tax credits or accelerated depreciation of fixed assets. Analysts
                          should also be aware of any governmental or business changes that can alter tax rates.
                              Differences in tax rates can be an important driver of value. Generally, three types
                          of tax rates are relevant to analysts:
                             ■    The statutory tax rate, which is the corporate income tax rate in the coun-
                                  try in which the company is domiciled.
                             ■    The effective tax rate, which is calculated as the reported income tax
                                  expense amount on the income statement divided by the pre-tax income.
                             ■    The cash tax rate, which is the tax paid in cash that period (cash tax)
                                  divided by pre-tax income.
                              As discussed previously, differences between cash taxes and reported taxes typi-
                          cally result from differences between financial accounting standards and tax laws and
                          result from changes in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.
                              In forecasting tax expense and cash taxes, respectively, the effective tax rate and
                          cash tax rate are key. A good understanding of their operational drivers and the finan-
                          cial structure of a company is useful in forecasting these tax rates.
Corporate Income Tax Rates                                                                    295


     Differences between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate can arise for
many reasons. Tax credits, withholding tax on dividends, adjustments to previous
years, and expenses not deductible for tax purposes are among the reasons for dif-
ferences. Effective tax rates can also differ when companies are active outside the
country in which they are domiciled. The effective tax rate becomes a blend of the
different tax rates of the countries in which the activities take place in relation to the
profit generated in each country. If a company reports a high profit in a country with
a high tax rate and a low profit in a country with a low tax rate, the effective tax rate
will be the weighted average of the rates and higher than the simple average tax rate
of both countries.
     In general, an effective tax rate that is consistently lower than statutory rates or
the effective tax rates reported by competitors is not necessarily unusual but might
warrant additional attention when forecasting future tax expenses. The notes in the
financial statements should disclose a reconciliation of the statutory tax rate to the
effective rate and identify the items that significantly contribute to a temporarily high
or low effective tax rate. The cash tax rate is used for forecasting cash flows, and the
effective tax rate is relevant for projecting earnings on the income statement.
     In developing an estimated tax rate for forecasts, analysts should adjust for one-time
events. If the income from equity-method investees is a substantial part of pre-tax
income and, also a volatile component of it, the effective tax rate excluding this amount
is likely to be a better estimate for the future tax costs for a company. The tax impact
from income from participations is disclosed in the notes on the financial statements.
     Often, a good starting point for estimating future tax expense is a tax rate based
on normalized operating income, before the results from associates and special items.
This normalized tax rate should be a good indication of the future tax expense, adjusted
for special items, in an analyst’s earnings model.
     Building a model allows the effective tax amount to be found in the profit and loss
projections and the cash tax amount on the cash flow statement (or given as supple-
mental information). The reconciliation between the profit and loss tax amount and
the cash flow tax figures should be the change in the deferred tax asset or liability.

                          1. What will happen to the effective tax rate for the next three years if the
                             profit before tax in Country A is stable but the profit before tax in Country
                             B grows 15 percent annually?
                             Solution:
                             The effective tax rate will gradually decline because a higher proportion of
                             profit will be generated in the country with the lower tax rate each year. In
                             Exhibit 12, the effective tax rate declines from 25 percent in the beginning to
                             22 percent in the third year.

                          2. Evaluate the cash tax and effective tax rates for the next three years if the tax
                             authorities in Country A allow some costs (e.g., accelerated depreciation)
                             to be taken sooner for tax purposes. Specifically, assume for Country A, the
                             result is a 50 percent reduction in taxes paid in the current year (Year 0) but
                             an increase in taxes paid by the same amount in the following year (Year 1)
                             and in subsequent years. Assume stable profit before tax in Country A and
                             15 percent annual before-tax-profit growth in Country B.
                             Solution:
                             The combined cash tax rate (last line in Exhibit 13) will be 15 percent in the
                             first year and then rebound in subsequent years. Only the rate for the first
                             year will benefit from a tax deferral; in subsequent years, the deferral for
                             a given year will be offset by the addition of the amount postponed from
                             the previous year. The combined effective tax rate will be unaffected by the
                             deferral. As shown in Exhibit 13, beginning with the second year (Year 1),
                             the combined cash tax and effective tax rates decline over time because the
                             growth in taxable income occurs in Country B, which has the lower tax rate.

  3. Repeat the exercise of the Tax Rate Estimates Problem, but now assume that
     Country B, rather than Country A, allows some costs to be taken sooner for
     tax purposes and that the tax effect described applies to Country B. Con-
     tinue to assume stable profit before tax in Country A and 15 percent annual
     profit growth in Country B.
     Solution:
     The combined effective tax rate is unchanged from Exhibit 12 and Exhibit
     13. Because of the growth assumed for Country B, however, the annual tax
     postponement will result in a lower cash tax rate in Country B than the
     effective tax rate in Country B. Consequently, as shown in Exhibit 14, the
     combined cash tax rate will be less than the effective tax rate in Year 0.

                               JNJ’s income tax expense for 2021 was USD1,898 million. Accordingly, JNJ’s
                           effective tax rate was 8.3 percent (USD1,898/USD22,776). This is substantially
                           lower than JNJ’s statutory tax rate of 21 percent as a US corporation. JNJ’s rec-
                           onciliation of its statutory tax rate to its effective tax rate reported in its notes to
                           financial statements shows that the primary driver of this differences is a lower

QUESTION SET


  1. Which of the following best describes a statutory tax rate?
      A. Tax paid in cash that period divided by pre-tax income
      B. Corporate income tax rate in the country in which the company is
         domiciled
      C. Reported income tax expense amount on the income statement
         divided by the pre-tax income
     Solution:
     B is correct. The statutory tax rate is the corporate income tax rate in the
     country in which the company is domiciled. A is incorrect because it de-
     scribes the cash tax rate. C is incorrect because it describes the effective tax
     rate.

                             Solution:
                             A is correct. The effective tax rate is calculated as the total provision for
                             income taxes (USD4,756 million) divided by Total income before taxes

                             Solution:
                             B is correct. The cash tax rate is calculated as the current tax expense
                             (USD5,515 million) divided by Total income before taxes (USD18,696
                             million).

                          Please use the following information to answer questions 4 and 5 below:
                             Neutrino is a hypothetical company that is domiciled in the United States
                          and that has significant operations in Ireland. The Statutory Tax rate in the
                          United States is 21 percent, and the statutory tax rate in Ireland is 12 percent.
                          Assume that Neutrino earns USD1,000 in profit before taxes in each country
                          during year 20X1.

                          4. Assuming that there are no other differences between Neutrino’s effective
                             and statutory tax rates, Neutrino’s combined effective tax rate is closest to:
                             A. 12.0 percent.
Presentation and Disclosure                                                                   301


      B. 16.5 percent.
       C. 21.0 percent.
      Solution:
      B is correct. Taxes are calculated as: (USD1,000 × 21%) + (USD1,000 × 12%)
      = USD330; Effective tax rate = USD330/USD2,000 = 16.5%.

   5. Assume on January 1 the following year, 20X2, Neutrino acquires company
      EFG, which is domiciled in South Korea. The statutory tax rate in South Ko-
      rea is 25 percent. EFG earns USD500 in profits in 20X2. Assuming US and
      Ireland operations each increase pre-tax profits by 25 percent, the effective
      tax rate in 20X2 for the consolidated entity is closest to:
      A. 6.5 percent.
      B. 17.9 percent.
       C. 22.0 percent.
      Solution:

PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE
                                                                                          5
              analyze disclosures relating to deferred tax items and the effective
              tax rate reconciliation and explain how information included in these
              disclosures affects a company’s financial statements and financial
              ratios

The Consolidated Statements of Operations (Income Statements) and Consolidated
Balance Sheets for Micron Technology (MU), a global technology company based in
the US, are provided in Exhibit 18 and Exhibit 19, respectively. Exhibit 18 provides
the income tax note disclosures for MU for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 fiscal years.
    MU’s income tax provision (i.e., income tax expense) for fiscal year 2017 is USD114
million (see Exhibit 18). The income tax note disclosure in Exhibit 20 reconciles how
the income tax provision was determined beginning with MU’s reported income
before taxes (shown in Exhibit 20 as USD5,196 million for fiscal year 2017). The note
disclosure then denotes the income tax provision for 2017 that is current (USD153
million), which is then offset by the deferred tax benefit for foreign taxes (USD39
million), for a net income tax provision of USD114 million. Exhibit 20 further shows
a reconciliation of how the income tax provision was derived from the US federal
302   Learning Module 9                                                                        Analysis of Income Taxes


                          statutory rate. Many public companies comply with this required disclosure by display-
                          ing the information in percentage terms, but MU has elected to provide the disclosure
                          in absolute dollar amounts. From this knowledge, for 2017, we can see that the dollar
                          amount shown for US federal income tax provision at the statutory rate (USD1,819
                          million) was determined by multiplying MU’s income before taxes by the 35 percent
                          US federal statutory rate (USD5,196 × 0.35 = USD1,819).
                              In addition, the note disclosure in Exhibit 20 provides detailed information about
                          the derivation of the deferred tax assets (USD766 million for 2017) and deferred tax
                          liabilities (USD17 million for 2017). These deferred tax assets are shown separately
                          on MU’s consolidated balance sheet for fiscal year 2017 with noncurrent assets (see
                          Exhibit 19), while the deferred tax liabilities are included in other noncurrent liabilities
                          (also see Exhibit 19).

The company has a valuation allowance against substantially all of its US net deferred
tax assets. As of 31 August 2017, the company had aggregate US tax net operating loss
carryforwards of USD3.88 billion and unused US tax credit carryforwards of USD416
million. The company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of
USD1.95 billion and unused state tax credits of USD233 million. The net operating
loss carryforwards and the tax credit carryforwards expire between 2018 to 2037.
    The changes in valuation allowance of USD64 million and USD63 million in 2017
and 2016, respectively, are primarily a result of uncertainties of realizing certain US
and foreign net operating losses and certain tax credit carryforwards.
    Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-US
subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to
result in additional tax liability. Remaining undistributed earnings of USD12.91 billion
as of 31 August 2017 have been indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount
of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.

EXAMPLE 6

   Financial Analysis
   Use the financial statement information and disclosures provided by MU in
   Exhibit 18–Exhibit 20 to answer the following questions:
306   Learning Module 9                                                               Analysis of Income Taxes


                          1. MU discloses a valuation allowance of USD2,321 million (see Exhibit 20)
                             against gross deferred assets of USD3,782 million in 2017. Does the exis-
                             tence of this valuation allowance have any implications concerning MU’s
                             future earnings prospects?
                            Solution:
                            According to Exhibit 20, MU’s deferred tax assets expire gradually until
                            2037 (2018 to 2037 for the net operating loss carryforwards and the tax
                            credit carryforwards).
                            Because the company is still relatively young, it is likely that most of these
                            expirations occur toward the end of that period. Because cumulative US
                            tax net operating loss carryforwards total USD3.88 billion, the valuation
                            allowance could imply that MU is not reasonably expected to earn USD3.88
                            billion over the next 20 years. However, as we can see in Exhibit 18, MU
                            earned a profit for 2017 and 2015, thereby showing that the allowance could
                            be adjusted downward if the company continues to generate profits in the
                            future and making it more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would
                            be recognized.

                          2. How would MU’s deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities be affected
                             if the federal statutory tax rate was changed to 21 percent?
                            Solution:
                            MU’s total deferred tax assets exceed total deferred tax liabilities by USD749
                            million. A change in the federal statutory tax rate to 21 percent from the
                            current rate of 35 percent would make these net deferred assets less valu-
                            able. Also, because it is possible that the deferred tax asset valuation allow-
                            ance could be adjusted downward in the future (see discussion to solution
                            1), the impact could be far greater in magnitude.

                          3. How would reported earnings have been affected if MU were not using a
                             valuation allowance?
                            Solution:
                            The disclosure in Exhibit 20 shows that the increase in the valuation
                            allowance increased the income tax provision as reported on the income
                            statement by USD64 million in 2017. Additional potential reductions in the
                            valuation allowance could similarly reduce reported income taxes (actual
                            income taxes would not be affected by a valuation allowance established for
                            financial reporting) in future years (see discussion to solution 1).

                          4. How would MU’s USD3.88 billion in net operating loss carryforwards in
                             2017 (see Exhibit 20) affect the valuation that an acquiring company would
                             be willing to offer?
                            Solution:
                            If an acquiring company is profitable, it may be able to use MU’s tax loss
                            carryforwards to offset its own tax liabilities. The value to an acquirer would
                            be the present value of the carryforwards, based on the acquirer’s tax rate
                            and expected timing of realization. The higher the acquiring company’s tax
                            rate, and the more profitable the acquirer, the sooner it would be able to
                            benefit. Therefore, an acquirer with a high current tax rate would theoreti-
                            cally be willing to pay more than an acquirer with a lower tax rate.
Presentation and Disclosure                                                             307


   5. Under what circumstances should the analyst consider MU’s deferred tax
      liability as debt or as equity? Under what circumstances should the analyst
      exclude MU’s deferred tax liability from both debt and equity when calculat-
      ing the debt-to-equity ratio?
      Solution:
      The analyst should classify the deferred tax liability as debt if the liabil-
      ity is expected to reverse with subsequent tax payment. If the liability is
      not expected to reverse, there is no expectation of a cash outflow and the
      liability should be treated as equity. By way of example, future company
      losses may preclude the payment of any income taxes, or changes in tax laws
      could result in taxes that are never paid. The deferred tax liability should
      be excluded from both debt and equity when both the amounts and timing
      of tax payments resulting from the reversals of temporary differences are
      uncertain.



QUESTION SET


   1. Deferred tax liabilities should be treated as equity when:
      A. they are not expected to reverse.
      B. the timing of tax payments is uncertain.
       C. the amount of tax payments is uncertain.
      Solution:
      A is correct. If the liability will not reverse, there will be no required tax
      payment in the future and the “liability” should be treated as equity.

   2. When both the timing and amount of tax payments are uncertain, analysts
      should treat deferred tax liabilities as:
      A. equity.
      B. liabilities.
       C. neither liabilities nor equity.
      Solution:
      C is correct. The deferred tax liability should be excluded from both debt
      and equity when both the amounts and timing of tax payments resulting
      from the reversals of temporary differences are uncertain.

                          3. In Year 3, the company’s US GAAP income statement recorded a provision
                             for income taxes closest to:
                             A. USD30,632.
                             B. USD54,144.
                              C. USD58,772.
                             Solution:
                             B is correct. The income tax provision in Year 3 was USD54,144, consisting
                             of USD58,772 in current income taxes, of which USD4,628 were deferred.

                          4. The company’s effective tax rate was highest in:
                             A. Year 1.
                             B. Year 2.
                              C. Year 3.
                             Solution:
                             B is correct. The effective tax rate of 30.1 percent (USD56,860/USD189,167)
                             was higher than the effective rates in Year 1 and Year 3.

                          5. Relative to the company’s effective tax rate on US income, the company’s
                             effective tax rate on foreign income was:
                             A. lower in each year presented.
                             B. higher in each year presented.

                             Solution:
                             A is correct. In Year 3 the effective tax rate on foreign operations was 24.2
                             percent [(USD28,140 + USD124)/USD116,704], and the effective US tax rate
                             was [(USD30,632 − USD4,752)/USD88,157] = 29.4 percent. In Year 2 the
                             effective tax rate on foreign operations was 26.2 percent, and the US rate
                             was 35.9 percent. In Year 1 the foreign rate was 24.1 percent, and the US
                             rate was 35.5 percent.

   6. In Year 3, the company’s net income (loss) was closest to:
      A. (USD217,000).
      B. (USD329,000).
       C. (USD556,000).
      Solution:
      C is correct. The income tax provision at the statutory rate of 34 percent
      is a benefit of USD112,000, suggesting that the pre-tax income was a
      loss of USD112,000/0.34 = (USD329,412). The income tax provision was
      USD227,000. (USD329,412) − USD227,000 = (USD556,412).

   7. The USD357,000 adjustment in Year 3 most likely resulted in:
      A. an increase in deferred tax assets.
      B. an increase in deferred tax liabilities.
       C. no change to deferred tax assets and liabilities.
      Solution:
      C is correct. Accounting expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes
      result in a permanent difference, and thus do not give rise to deferred taxes.

   8. Over the three years presented, changes in the valuation allowance for de-
      ferred tax assets were most likely indicative of:
      A. decreased prospect for future profitability.
      B. increased prospects for future profitability.

                           C. assets being carried at a higher value than their tax base.
                          Solution:
                          B is correct. Over the three-year period, changes in the valuation allowance
                          reduced cumulative income taxes by USD1,670,000. The reductions to the
                          valuation allowance were a result of the company being “more likely than
                          not” to earn sufficient taxable income to offset the deferred tax assets.

5. Jamison Corp. is domiciled in the United States and has significant operations in
   the United Kingdom and Australia. The statutory tax rates are 21 percent in the
   United States, 19 percent in the United Kingdom, and 30 percent in Australia.
   The company generates Profit before tax of USD2,000,000 in the United States,

                             USD500,000 in the United Kingdom, and USD750,000 in Australia. There are no
                             other differences between Jamison’s effective and statutory tax rates. Jamison’s
                             combined effective tax rate is closest to:
                             A. 21.0 percent.

                             B. 22.8 percent.

                             C. 23.3 percent.

                          6. Which of the following statements about tax rates is correct?
                             A. The effective tax rate is typically used for forecasting cash flows.

                             B. The cash tax rate is relevant for projecting earnings on the income
                                statement.

                             C. A company’s income tax expense equals the sum of current taxes plus the
                                change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

                             SOLUTIONS
                          1. A is correct. Because the carrying amount is less than the tax base for this asset,
                             this difference is a temporary difference that will result in a deferred tax asset. B
                             is incorrect because a deferred tax liability would apply if the carrying amount
                             was greater than the asset base. C is incorrect because this is not a permanent
                             difference thus there will be either a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability.

                          2. A is correct. Permanent differences are differences between tax laws and ac-
                             counting standards that will not be reversed at some future date. Because they
                             will not be reversed at a future date, these differences do not give rise to deferred
                             tax. These items include tax credits for expenditures that directly reduce taxes,
                             such as tax credits related to the purchase of solar power. B is incorrect because
                             taxable temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities.
                             C is incorrect because deductible temporary differences result in a deferred tax
                             asset.

                          3. A is correct. USD450 is calculated as: (USD7,000 − USD5,714) × 0.35 = USD450.
                             B is incorrect because it incorrectly sums the deferred tax liabilities from Years
                             2 and 3: (USD7,000 − USD5,714) × 0.35 + (USD8,000 − USD7,143) × 0.35 =
                             USD750. C is incorrect because it incorrectly sums the deferred tax liabilities
                             from Years 1, 2 and 3: (USD7,000 − USD5,714) × 0.35 + (USD8,000 − USD7,143)
                             × 0.35 + (USD9,000 − USD8,571) × 0.35 = USD900.

                          4. C is correct. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are added to in-
                             come tax payable to determine the company’s income tax expense (or credit) as
                             it is reported on the income statement. A and B are incorrect because it is the
                             changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are added to income tax payable.

                          5. B is correct. The combined effective tax rate is calculated as:

                          Country               Taxable Income            Statutory Rate                Taxes

                          Australia                   750,000                  30                      225,000
                          Total                  USD3,250,000                                          740,000


                          Effective tax rate:                            740,000/3,250,000                  22.8%

                              The effective tax rate is a blend of the different tax rates of the countries in which
                              the activities take place in relation to the profit generated in each country.
                              A is incorrect because 21.0 percent is the statutory tax rate in the US and does
                              not incorporate statutory tax rates in the United Kingdom and Australia. C is in-
                              correct because 23.3 percent is the simple average of all three statutory tax rates.

                          6. C is correct. A company’s income tax expense equals the sum of current taxes
                             (i.e., the amount currently payable) plus the change in deferred tax assets and
                             liabilities. A is incorrect because the cash tax rate is typically used for forecasting
                             cash flows. B is incorrect because the effective tax rate is relevant for projecting
                             earnings on the income statement.

                          7. C is correct. The effective tax rate of 24.5 percent (USD42,986/USD175,284) in
                             Year 3 was lower than the effective tax rates in Year 1 and Year 2. A is incorrect
Solutions                                                                                   315


   because its effective tax rate of 30.1 percent is higher than that of Year 3. B is in-
   correct because its effective tax rate of 26.1 percent is higher than that of Year 3.

8. C is correct. In Year 1, the effective tax rate on foreign operations was 37.6
   percent [(USD17,591 + USD262)/USD47,542], and the effective US tax rate was
   [(USD31,143 − USD5,325)/USD97,321] = 26.5 percent. In Year 2, the effective tax
   rate on foreign operations was 25.6 percent, and the US rate was 26.4 percent. In
   Year 3, the foreign rate was 25.7 percent, and the US rate was 24.0 percent.

              1            INTRODUCTION
                           Financial reporting quality varies across companies. The ability to assess the quality
                           of a company’s financial reporting is an important skill for analysts. Indications of
                           low-quality financial reporting can prompt an analyst to maintain heightened skepticism
                           when reading a company’s reports, to review disclosures critically when undertaking
                           financial statement analysis, and to incorporate appropriate adjustments in assessments
                           of past performance and forecasts of future performance.

                             LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                                 ■   Financial reporting quality can be thought of as spanning a
                                     continuum. Reporting of the highest quality contains infor-
                                     mation that is relevant, correct, complete, and unbiased, whereas the
                                     lowest quality reporting contains information that is not just biased or
                                     incomplete but possibly pure fabrication.
                                 ■   Reporting quality, the focus of this module, pertains to the quality of
                                     the information disclosed. High-quality reporting represents the eco-
                                     nomic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period
                                     and the company’s financial condition at the end of the period.
                                 ■   Results quality (commonly referred to as earnings quality) pertains to
                                     the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic
                                     activities and the resulting financial condition, relative to expecta-
                                     tions of current and future financial performance. Quality earnings
                                     can be regarded as more sustainable, providing a sound platform for
                                     forecasts.
                                 ■   An aspect of financial reporting quality is the degree to which
                                     accounting choices are conservative or aggressive. “Aggressive” typ-
                                     ically refers to choices that aim to enhance the company’s reported
                                     performance and financial position by inflating the amount of rev-
                                     enues, earnings, and/or operating cash flow reported in the period;
                                     or by decreasing expenses for the period and/or the amount of debt
                                     reported on the balance sheet.
                                 ■   Conservatism in financial reports can result from either (1) accounting
                                     standards that specifically require a conservative treatment of a trans-
                                     action or an event or (2) judgments made by managers when applying
                                     accounting standards that result in conservative results.
                                 ■   Managers may be motivated to issue less-than-high-quality financial
                                     reports to mask poor performance, boost the company’s stock price,
                                     to increase personal compensation, and/or to avoid violation of debt
                                     covenants.
                                 ■   Conditions that are conducive to the issuance of low-quality finan-
                                     cial reports include a cultural environment that result in fewer or
                                     less transparent financial disclosures, book/tax conformity that shifts
                                     emphasis toward legal compliance and away from fair presentation,
                                     and limited capital markets regulation.
                                 ■   Mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality include open
                                     capital markets and incentives for companies to minimize cost of cap-
                                     ital, independent auditors, contract provisions specifically tailored to
                                     penalize misreporting, and enforcement by regulatory entities.
Conceptual Overview                                                                                             319


        ■   Pro forma earnings (also commonly referred to as non-GAAP or
            non-IFRS earnings) adjust earnings as reported on the income state-
            ment. Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of
            aggressive presentation choices.
        ■   Companies are required to make additional disclosures when present-
            ing any non-GAAP or non-IFRS metric.
        ■   Managers’ considerable flexibility in choosing their companies’
            accounting policies and in formulating estimates provides opportuni-
            ties for aggressive accounting.
        ■   Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets
            include inventory cost flow assumptions, estimates of uncollectible
            accounts receivable, estimated realizability of deferred tax assets,
            depreciation method, estimated salvage value of depreciable assets,
            and estimated useful life of depreciable assets.
        ■   Cash flow from operations is an important metric for investors that
            can be enhanced by management’s operating choices, such as stretch-
            ing accounts payable, and potentially by classification choices.




CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW
                                                                                                            2
                compare financial reporting quality with the quality of reported
                results (including quality of earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet
                items)

Ideally, analysts would always have access to financial reports that are based on
sound financial reporting standards, such as those from the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and
that are free from manipulation. But, in practice, the quality of financial reports can
vary greatly. High-quality financial reporting provides information that is useful to
analysts in assessing a company’s performance and prospects. Low-quality financial
reporting contains inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information.
    Extreme lapses in financial reporting quality have given rise to high-profile scan-
dals that resulted not only in investor losses but also in reduced confidence in the
financial system. Financial statement users who were able to accurately assess financial
reporting quality were better positioned to avoid losses. These lapses illustrate the
challenges analysts face as well as the potential costs of failing to recognize practices
that result in misleading or inaccurate financial reports.1 Examples of misreporting
can provide an analyst with insight into various signals that may indicate poor-quality
financial reports.
    This module addresses financial reporting quality, which pertains to the quality of
information in financial reports, including disclosures in notes. High-quality reporting
provides decision-useful information, which is relevant and faithfully represents the
economic reality of the company’s activities during the reporting period as well as the
company’s financial condition at the end of the period. A separate but interrelated


1 In this module, the examples of misleading or inaccurate financial reports occurred in prior years—not
because there are no current examples of questionable financial reporting, but rather because it has been
conclusively resolved that misreporting occurred in the historical examples.

                           attribute of quality is quality of reported results or earnings quality, which pertains
                           to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and
                           the resulting financial condition. The term “earnings quality” is commonly used in
                           practice and will be used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings, cash flow, or
                           balance sheet items. High-quality earnings result from activities that a company likely
                           will be able to sustain in the future and provide a sufficient return on the company’s
                           investment. The concepts of earnings quality and financial reporting quality are
                           interrelated because a correct assessment of earnings quality is possible only when
                           there is some basic level of financial reporting quality. Beyond this basic level, as the
                           quality of reporting increases, the ability of financial statement users to correctly assess
                           earnings quality and to develop expectations for future performance also increases.
                               After providing a conceptual overview of reporting quality, this module discusses
                           motivations that might cause, and conditions that might enable, management to issue
                           financial reports that are not high quality and mechanisms that aim to provide disci-
                           pline to financial reporting quality. We also describe choices made by management
                           that can affect financial reporting quality—presentation choices, accounting methods,
                           and estimates—as well as warning signs of poor-quality financial reporting.


                           Conceptual Overview
                           Financial reporting quality and results or earnings quality are interrelated attributes
                           of quality. Exhibit 1 illustrates this interrelationship and its implications.

                           As shown in Exhibit 1, if financial reporting quality is low, the information provided
                           is of little use in assessing the company’s performance, and thus in making investment
                           and other decisions.
                               Financial reporting quality varies across companies. High-quality reports contain
                           information that is relevant, complete, neutral, and free from error. The lowest-quality
                           reports contain information that is pure fabrication. Earnings (results) quality can
                           range from high and sustainable to low and unsustainable. Providers of resources pre-
                           fer high and sustainable earnings. Combining the two measures of quality—financial
                           reporting and earnings—the overall quality of financial reports from a user perspective
                           can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest to the lowest. Exhibit 2
                           presents a quality spectrum that provides a basis for evaluating better versus poorer
                           quality reports. This spectrum ranges from reports that are of high financial reporting
                           quality and reflect high and sustainable earnings quality to reports that are not useful
                           because of poor financial reporting quality.

GAAP, DECISION USEFUL FINANCIAL REPORTING
                                                                                                           3
                describe a spectrum for assessing financial reporting quality

At the top of the spectrum, labeled in Exhibit 2 as “GAAP, decision-useful, sustainable,
and adequate returns,” are high-quality reports that provide useful information about
high-quality earnings.
    ■   High-quality financial reports conform to the generally accepted account-
        ing principles (GAAP) of the jurisdiction, such as International Financial
        Reporting Standards (IFRS), US GAAP, or other home-country GAAP. The
        exhibit uses the term GAAP to refer generically to the accounting standards
        accepted in a company’s jurisdiction.
    ■   In addition to conforming to GAAP, high-quality financial reports also
        embody the characteristics of decision-useful information, such as those
        defined in the Conceptual Framework.2 Recall that the fundamental char-
        acteristics of useful information are relevance and faithful representation.
        Relevant information is defined as information that can affect a decision and
        encompasses the notion of materiality. (Information is considered material if


2 The characteristics of decision-useful information are identical under IFRS and US GAAP. In September
2010, the IASB adopted the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting in place of the Framework for
the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements (1989). The Conceptual Framework represents the
partial completion of a joint convergence project between the IASB and FASB on an updated framework.
The Conceptual Framework (2010) contains two updated chapters: “The Objective of Financial Reporting”
and “Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information.” The remainder of the material in the
Conceptual Framework is from the Framework (1989) and will be updated as the project is completed.
Also in September 2010, the FASB issued Concepts Statement 8, “Conceptual Framework for Financial
Reporting,” to replace Concepts Statements 1 and 2.

                                   “omitting it or misstating it could influence decisions that users make on the
                                   basis of the financial information of a specific reporting entity.”3) Faithful
                                   representation of economic events is complete, neutral, and free from error.
                               The Conceptual Framework also enumerates enhancing characteristics of useful
                           information: comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability. Of course,
                           the desirable characteristics for financial information require trade-offs. For example,
                           financial reports must balance the aim of providing information that is produced
                           quickly enough to be timely and thus relevant, and yet not so quickly that errors occur.
                           Financial reports must balance the aim of providing information that is complete but
                           not so exhaustive that immaterial information is included. High-quality information
                           results when these and other trade-offs are made in an unbiased, skillful manner.
                               ■   High-quality earnings indicate an adequate level of return on investment
                                   and derive from activities that a company likely will be able to sustain in
                                   the future. An adequate level of return on investment exceeds the cost of
                                   the investment and also equals or exceeds the expected return. Sustainable
                                   activities and sustainable earnings are those expected to recur in the future.
                                   Sustainable earnings that provide a high return on investment contribute to
                                   higher valuation of a company and its securities.


                           GAAP, Decision-Useful, but Sustainable?
                           The next level down in Exhibit 2, “GAAP, decision-useful, but sustainable?” refers to
                           circumstances in which high-quality reporting provides useful information, but that
                           information reflects results or earnings that are not sustainable (lower earnings quality).
                           The earnings may not be sustainable because the company cannot expect earnings that
                           generate the same level of return on investment in the future or because the earnings,
                           although replicable, will not generate sufficient return on investment to sustain the
                           company. Earnings quality is low in both cases. Reporting can be high quality even
                           when the economic reality being depicted is not of high quality. For example, consider
                           a company that generates a loss, or earnings that do not provide an adequate return
                           on investment, or earnings that resulted from non-recurring activities. The relatively
                           undesirable economic reality could nonetheless be depicted in financial reporting that
                           provides high-quality, decision-useful information.
                               Exhibit 3 presents an excerpt from the fiscal year 2014 first-quarter results of Toyota
                           Motor Corporation, a Japanese automobile company. As highlighted by a Wall Street
                           Journal article,4 the company sold fewer cars but reported an 88 percent increase in
                           operating profits compared with the prior year, primarily because of the change in
                           exchange rates. The weaker yen benefited Toyota both because the company manufac-
                           tures more cars in Japan (compared with its competitors) and because the company
                           sells a significant number of cars outside of Japan. Exchange rate weakening is a less
                           sustainable source of profits than manufacturing and selling cars. In summary, this
                           example is a case of high-quality financial reporting coupled with lower earnings quality.

       As for the results of operations, net revenues increased by 753.7 billion yen,
   or 13.7%, to 6,255.3 billion yen in FY2014 first quarter compared with FY2013
   first quarter, and operating income increased by 310.2 billion yen, or 87.9%, to
   663.3 billion yen in FY2014 first quarter compared with FY2013 first quarter.
   The factors contributing to an increase in operating income were the effects of
   changes in exchange rates of 260.0 billion yen, cost reduction efforts of 70.0 billion
   yen, marketing efforts of 30.0 billion yen and other factors of 10.2 billion yen.
   On the other hand, the factors contributing to a decrease in operating income
   were the increase in expenses and others of 60.0 billion yen.

BIASED ACCOUNTING CHOICES
                                                                                                4
                describe a spectrum for assessing financial reporting quality

The next level down in the spectrum shown in Exhibit 2 is “Within GAAP, but biased
choices.” Biased choices result in financial reports that do not faithfully represent the
economic substance of what is being reported. The problem with bias in financial
reporting, as with other deficiencies in reporting quality, is that it impedes an inves-
tor’s ability to correctly assess a company’s past performance, to accurately forecast
future performance, and thus to appropriately value the company.
    Choices are deemed to be “aggressive” if they increase a company’s reported per-
formance and financial position in the period under review. The choice can increase
the amount of revenues, earnings, or operating cash flow reported for the period, or
decrease expenses, or reduce the level of debt reported on the balance sheet. Aggressive
choices may lead to a reduction in the company’s reported performance and in its
financial position in later periods. In contrast, choices are deemed “conservative” if
they decrease a company’s performance and financial position in the reporting period.
This can include lowering the reported revenues, earnings, or operating cash flow
reported or increasing expenses, or recording a higher level of debt on the balance
sheet. Conservative choices may lead to a rise in the company’s reported performance
and financial position in later periods.
    Another type of bias is understatement of earnings volatility, so-called earnings
smoothing. Earnings smoothing can result from conservative choices to understate
earnings in periods when a company’s operations are performing well, building up
(often hidden) reserves that allow aggressive choices in periods when its operations
are struggling.
    Biased choices can be made not only in the context of reported amounts but also
in the context of how information is presented. For example, companies can disclose
information transparently, which facilitates analysis, or they can disclose it in a manner
that aims to obscure unfavorable or emphasize favorable information.

   1. Based on the segment data excerpted from the notes to the financial state-
      ments, was PACCAR’s truck segment profitable in 2009?
      Solution:
      Yes, the segment data presented in the note to the financial statements indi-
      cates that the truck segment earned USD25.9 million in 2009.

   2. Based on the data about the truck’s gross margin presented in the MD&A,
      was PACCAR’s truck segment profitable in 2009?
      Solution:
      No, the segment data presented in the MD&A indicates that the truck seg-
      ment had a negative gross margin.

   3. What is the main difference between the note presentation and the MD&A
      presentation?
      Solution:
      The main difference between the note presentation and the MD&A presen-
      tation is that the aftermarket parts business is combined with the trucks
      business in the notes but is separated in the MD&A. Although the data
      are not exactly comparable in the two disclosures (because the note shows
      income before taxes and the MD&A shows gross profit), the two disclosures
      present a different picture of PACCAR’s profits from truck sales.

   4. The SEC complaint stated that “PACCAR failed to report the operating re-
      sults of its aftermarket parts business separately from its truck sales business
      as required under segment reporting requirements, which are in place to en-
      sure that investors gain the same insight into a company as its executives.” Is
      the PACCAR situation an example of issues with financial reporting quality,
      earnings quality, or both?
      Solution:
      The PACCAR situation appears to be an example of issues with both fi-
      nancial reporting quality and earnings quality. The substantial decrease in
      truck sales and the negative gross margin reflect poor earnings quality. The
      failure to disclose clear segment information is an instance of poor financial
      reporting quality.

    Although choices exist within GAAP for the presentation of a desired economic
picture, non-GAAP reporting adds yet another dimension of management discretion.
Non-GAAP reporting of financial metrics not in compliance with generally accepted
accounting principles, such as US GAAP and IFRS, includes both financial metrics
and operating metrics.5 Non-GAAP financial metrics relate directly to the financial
statements. A common non-GAAP financial metric is “non-GAAP earnings,” which
are created by companies “that adjust standards-compliant earnings to exclude items


5 The term “non-GAAP” refers generally to all metrics that are non-compliant with GAAP and thus
includes “non-IFRS” metrics.

                           required by accounting standards or to include items not permitted by accounting
                           standards” (Ciesielski and Henry, 2017). In contrast, non-GAAP operating metrics
                           do not relate directly to the financial statements and include metrics that are typically
                           industry-driven, such as subscriber numbers, active users, and occupancy rates.
                                Non-GAAP financial reporting has become increasingly common, presenting
                           challenges to analysts. An important challenge is that non-GAAP financial reporting
                           diminishes comparability across financial statements. The adjustments that companies
                           make to create non-GAAP earnings, for example, are generally ad hoc and thus differ
                           significantly. When evaluating non-GAAP metrics, investors must decide the extent to
                           which specific adjustments should be incorporated into their analyses and forecasts.6
                                Another challenge arises from differences in terminology. Non-GAAP earnings
                           are sometimes referred to as underlying earnings, adjusted earnings, recurring
                           earnings, core earnings, or similar. Exhibit 5 provides an example from Jaguar Land
                           Rover Automotive plc (JLR), a subsidiary of Tata Motors Ltd. The company prepares
                           its financial reports under IFRS. The exhibit is an excerpt from JLR’s 2016/17 annual
                           report and uses the term “alternative performance measures.” Exhibit 6 is from Tata
                           Motors Ltd.’s Form 6-K filed with the US SEC, containing supplemental information
                           regarding JLR and using the term “non-IFRS Financial Measures.” The information
                           in the two exhibits is essentially identical, but the terminology and formatting differ.

                              Many companies use alternative performance measures (APMs) to provide helpful
                              additional information for users of their financial statements, telling a clearer
                              story of how the business has performed over the period. . . . These measures
                              exclude certain items that are included in comparable statutory measures….

    Management emphasis on non-GAAP financial measures to deflect attention from
less-than-desirable GAAP financial results is an example of an aggressive presentation
choice. Since 2003, if a company uses a non-GAAP financial measure7 in an SEC fil-
ing, it is required to display the most directly comparable GAAP measure with equal
prominence and to provide a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measure and the
equivalent GAAP measure. In other words, a company is not allowed to give more
prominence to a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing.
    Similarly, the IFRS Practice Statement “Management Commentary,” issued
December 2010, requires disclosures when non-IFRS measures are included in
financial reports:
        If information from the financial statements has been adjusted for inclusion
        in management commentary, that fact should be disclosed. If financial per-
        formance measures that are not required or defined by IFRSs are included
        within management commentary, those measures should be defined and


7 Non-domestic private issuers can file financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS without
reconciliation to US GAAP. The SEC recognizes US GAAP and IFRS as GAAP.

                                  users. When financial performance measures are derived or drawn from
                                  the financial statements, those measures should be reconciled to measures
                                  presented in the financial statements that have been prepared in accordance
                                  with IFRSs. (page 17)

                           1. Based on the information provided in Exhibit 7, explain the differences
                              between the following two disclosures contained in Convatec’s press release:

                              A. CEO Review of 2016 results states that revenue grew 4 percent to
                                 USD1,688 million.
                              B. Convatec’s Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss shows 2016 reve-
                                 nues of USD1,688.3 million and 2015 revenues of USD1,650.4 million.
                             Solution:
                             The amount of revenue reported on the company’s income statement
                             conforms to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Using the
                             amounts from the income statement, the company’s total revenue increased
                             by 2.3% (= USD1,688.3/USD1,650.4 – 1). The revenue growth rate of 4
                             percent in the CEO review is a non-IFRS measure, calculated on a “constant
                             currency” basis, which the footnote describes as a comparison using 2016
                             revenues restated at 2015 foreign exchange rates.

                           2. Based on the information provided, explain the differences between the
                              following two disclosures contained in Convatecs’s earnings release:

                              A. The CEO Review of 2016 results states that adjusted EBITDA was
                                 USD508 million, up 6.5 percent at constant currency.
                              B. Convatec’s Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss shows 2016 net
                                 loss of USD202.8 million and 2015 net loss of USD93.4 million.
                             Solution:
                             The amounts reported on the company’s income statement conform to
                             IFRS. Using amounts from the income statement, the company reported
                             a loss in 2016 of USD202.8 million, which was more than twice as large
                             a loss as the USD93.4 million loss reported in 2015. Also referring to the
                             income statement, the company reported 2016 operating profit (referred to
                             elsewhere as EBIT) of USD154.0 million, a decline of 33.2 percent from the
                             USD230.4 million operating profit reported in 2016.
                             In contrast, the adjusted EBITDA amount highlighted in the CEO Review
                             is neither defined nor recognized under IFRS. It is a non-IFRS measure. To
                             create the adjusted EBITDA, the company first begins with EBIT (called
                             Operating profit in excerpts II and III) of USD154.0 and creates adjusted
                             EBIT (USD472.2 million) by adding back eight different expenses that IFRS
                             requires the company to recognize. These adjustments are listed beneath
                             the first tabular reconciliation in items (a) through (g). After developing
                             Adjusted EBIT, the company creates adjusted EBITDA (USD507.6 million)
                             by adding back a further three different expenses that IFRS requires the
                             company to recognize.
                             Overall, there are three key differences between Disclosures A and B: (1)
                             Most important, disclosure A refers to a non-IFRS metric rather than an IF-
Biased Accounting Choices                                                                                      331


       RS-compliant metric; (2) Disclosure A refers to operating profit, which was
       positive, rather than to net income, which was negative; and (3) Disclosure
       A highlights a positive economic outcome—that is, an increase, on a curren-
       cy-adjusted basis. An analyst should be aware of the alternative means by
       which earnings announcements can paint a positive picture of companies’
       results.

     Often, poor reporting quality occurs simultaneously with poor earnings quality;
for example, aggressive accounting choices are made to obscure poor performance.
It is also possible, of course, for poor reporting quality to occur with high-quality
earnings. Although a company with good performance would not require aggressive
accounting choices to obscure poor performance, it might nonetheless produce
poor-quality reports for other reasons. A company with good performance might
not be able to produce high-quality reports because of inadequate internal systems.
     Another scenario in which poor reporting quality might occur simultaneously with
high-quality earnings is that a company with good performance might deliberately
produce reports based on “conservative” rather than aggressive accounting choices—
that is, choices that make current performance look worse. One motivation might
be to avoid unwanted political attention. Another motivation could arise in a period
in which management had already exceeded targets before the end of the period and
thus made conservative accounting choices that would delay reporting profits until
the following period (so-called hidden reserves). Similar motivations might also con-
tribute to accounting choices that create the appearance that the trajectory of future
results would appear more attractive. For example, a company might make choices
to accelerate losses in the first year of an acquisition or the first year of a new CEO’s
tenure so that the trajectory of future results would appear more attractive.
     Overall, unbiased financial reporting is optimal. Some investors may prefer con-
servative choices rather than aggressive ones, however, because a positive surprise is
easier to tolerate than a negative surprise. Biased reporting, whether conservative or
aggressive, adversely affects a user’s ability to assess a company.
     The quality spectrum considers the more intuitive situation in which less-than-desired
underlying economics are the central motivation for poor reporting quality. In addition,
it is necessary to have some degree of reporting quality in order to evaluate earnings
quality. Proceeding down the spectrum, therefore, the concepts of reporting quality
and earnings quality become progressively less distinguishable.


Within GAAP, but “Earnings Management”
The next level down on the spectrum shown in Exhibit 2 is labeled “Within GAAP,
but ‘earnings management.’” The term “earnings management” is defined as making
intentional choices that create biased financial reports.8 The distinction between
earnings management and biased choices is subtle and, primarily, a matter of intent.
Earnings management represents “deliberate actions to influence reported earnings
and their interpretation” (Ronen and Yaari, 2008). Earnings can be “managed” upward
(increased) by taking real actions, such as deferring research and development (R&D)
expenses into the next reporting period. Alternatively, earnings can be increased by
accounting choices, such as changing accounting estimates. For example, the amount of




8 Various definitions have appeared in academic research. Closest to the discussion is Schipper (1989),
which uses the term “earnings management” to mean “‘disclosure management’ in the sense of a purposeful
intervention in the external financial reporting process, with the intent of obtaining some private gain (as
opposed to, say, merely facilitating the neutral operation of the process).”

                           estimated product returns, bad debt expense, or asset impairment could be decreased
                           to create higher earnings. Because it is difficult to determine intent, we include earn-
                           ings management under the biased choices discussion.




              5            DEPARTURES FROM GAAP

                                         describe a spectrum for assessing financial reporting quality

                           The next levels down on the spectrum shown in Exhibit 2 mark departures from
                           GAAP. Financial reporting that departs from GAAP generally can be considered to
                           be low quality. In such situations, earnings quality is likely difficult or impossible
                           to assess because comparisons with earlier periods and/or other entities cannot be
                           made. An example of improper accounting was Enron (accounting issues revealed in
                           2001), whose inappropriate use of off-balance-sheet structures and other complex
                           transactions resulted in vastly understated indebtedness as well as overstated profits
                           and operating cash flow. Another notorious example of improper accounting was
                           WorldCom (accounting issues discovered in 2002), a company that by improperly
                           capitalizing certain expenditures dramatically understated its expenses and thus
                           overstated its profits. New Century Financial (who accounting issues were revealed in
                           2007) issued billions of dollars of subprime mortgages and improperly reserved only
                           minimal amounts for loan repurchase losses. Each of these companies subsequently
                           filed for bankruptcy.
                                In the 1980s, Polly Peck International (PPI) reported currency losses, incurred
                           in the normal course of operations, directly through equity rather than in its profit
                           and loss statements. In the 1990s, Sunbeam improperly reported revenues from
                           “bill-and-hold” sales and also manipulated the timing of expenses in an effort to falsely
                           portray outstanding performance of its then-new chief executive.
                                At the bottom of the quality spectrum, fabricated reports portray fictitious events,
                           either to deceive investors by misrepresenting the company’s performance or to
                           obscure fraudulent misappropriation of the company’s assets. Examples of fraudulent
                           reporting are unfortunately easy to find, although they were not necessarily easy to
                           identify at the time. In the 1970s, Equity Funding Corp. created fictitious revenues and
                           even fictitious policyholders. In the 1980s, Crazy Eddie’s reported fictitious inventory
                           as well as fictitious revenues supported by fake invoices. In 2004, Parmalat reported
                           fictitious bank balances.

                              Spectrum for Assessing Quality of Financial Reports
                              Jake Lake, a financial analyst, has identified several items in the financial reports
                              of several (hypothetical) companies. Describe each of these items in the context
                              of the financial reporting quality spectrum.

                              1. ABC Co.’s 2018 earnings totaled USD233 million, including a USD100 mil-
                                 lion gain from selling one of its less profitable divisions. ABC’s earnings for
                                 the prior three years totaled USD120 million, USD107 million, and USD111
                                 million. The company’s financial reports are extremely clear and detailed,
Differentiate between Conservative and Aggressive Accounting                              333


     and the company’s earnings announcement highlights the one-time nature
     of the USD100 million gain.
     Solution:
     ABC’s 2018 total earnings quality can be viewed as low because nearly half
     of the earnings are derived from a non-sustainable activity, namely the sale
     of a division. ABC’s quality of earnings in 2018 from continuing operations
     may be high because the amounts are fairly consistent from year to year,
     although an analyst would undertake further analysis to confirm earnings
     quality. In general, a user of financial reports should look beyond the bot-
     tom-line net income. The description provided suggests that the company’s
     reporting quality is high; the reports are clear and detailed, and the one-
     time nature of the USD100 million gain is highlighted.

     ment from 3 years to 15 years. Equipment represents a substantial compo-
     nent of the company’s assets. The company’s disclosures indicate that the
     change is permissible under the accounting standards of its jurisdiction, but
     it provides only limited explanation of the change.
     Solution:
     DEF’s accounting choice appears to be within permissible accounting
     standards, but its effect is to substantially lower depreciation expense and
     thus to increase earnings for the year. The quality of reported earnings is
     questionable. Although the new level of earnings may be sustainable, similar
     increases in earnings for future periods might not be achievable, because
     increasing earnings solely by changing accounting estimates is likely not sus-
     tainable. In addition, the description provided suggests that the company’s
     reporting quality is low because it offers only a limited explanation for the
     change.

  3. GHI Co.’s R&D expenditures for the past five years have been approximate-
     ly 3 percent of sales. In 2018, the company significantly reduced its R&D
     expenditures. Without the reduction in R&D expenditures, the company
     would have reported a loss. No explanation is disclosed.
     Solution:
     GHI’s operational choice to reduce its R&D may reflect real earnings man-
     agement because the change enabled the company to avoid reporting a loss.
     In addition, the description provided suggests that the company’s reporting
     quality is low because it does not offer an explanation for the change.

                           This lesson returns to the implications of conservative and aggressive accounting
                           choices. As mentioned earlier, unbiased financial reporting is ideal. But some investors
                           may prefer or be perceived to prefer conservative rather than aggressive accounting
                           choices, because a positive surprise is acceptable. In contrast, management may make,
                           or be perceived to make, aggressive accounting choices because they increase the
                           company’s reported performance and financial position.
                               Aggressive accounting choices in the period under review may decrease the com-
                           pany’s reported performance and financial position in later periods, which creates a
                           sustainability issue. Conservative choices do not typically create a sustainability issue
                           because they decrease the company’s reported performance and financial position,
                           and may increase them in later periods. In terms of establishing expectations for the
                           future, however, financial reporting that is relevant and faithfully representative is
                           the most useful.
                               A common presumption is that financial reports are typically biased upward, but
                           that is not always the case. Although accounting standards ideally promote unbiased
                           financial reporting, some accounting standards may specifically require a conservative
                           treatment of a transaction or an event. Also, managers may choose to take a conser-
                           vative approach when applying standards. It is important that an analyst consider the
                           possibility of conservative choices and their effects.
                               At its most extreme, conservatism follows accounting practices that “anticipate no
                           profit, but anticipate all losses” (Bliss, 1924). But in general, conservatism means that
                           revenues may be recognized once a verifiable and legally enforceable receivable has
                           been generated and that losses need not be recognized until it becomes “probable” that
                           an actual loss will be incurred. Conservatism is not an absolute but is characterized by
                           degrees, such as “the accountant’s tendency to require a higher degree of verification
                           to recognize good news as gains than to recognize bad news as losses” (Basu, 1997).
                           From this perspective, “verification” (e.g., physical existence of inventories, evidence
                           of costs incurred or to be incurred, or establishment of rights and obligations on legal
                           grounds) drives the degree of conservatism. For recognition of revenues, a higher
                           degree of verification would be required than for expenses.


                           Conservatism in Accounting Standards
                           The Conceptual Framework supports neutrality of information: “A neutral depiction
                           is without bias in the selection or presentation of financial information.”9 Neutrality—
                           lack of upward or downward bias—is considered a desirable characteristic of finan-
                           cial reporting. Conservatism directly conflicts with the characteristic of neutrality
                           because the asymmetric nature of conservatism leads to bias in measuring assets and
                           liabilities—and, ultimately, earnings.
                               Despite efforts to support neutrality in financial reporting, many conservatively
                           biased standards remain. Standards across jurisdictions may differ on the extent of
                           conservatism embedded within them. An analyst should be aware of the implications
                           of accounting standards for the financial reports.

   An example is the different treatment by IFRS and US GAAP of the impairment of
long-lived assets.10 Both IFRS and US GAAP specify an impairment analysis protocol
that begins with an assessment of whether recent events indicate that the economic
benefit from an individual or group of long-lived assets may be less than its carrying
amount(s). From that point on, however, the two regimes diverge:
    ■   Under IFRS, if the “recoverable amount” (the higher of fair value less costs
        to sell and value in use) is less than the carrying amount, then an impair-
        ment charge will be recorded.
    ■   Under US GAAP, an impairment charge will be recorded only when the
        sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the
        asset(s) is less than the carrying amount(s). If the undiscounted future cash
        flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is written down to fair
        value.
    To illustrate the difference in application, assume that a factory is the unit of account
eligible for impairment testing. Its carrying amount is USD10,000,000; “fair value” and
“recoverable amount” are both USD6,000,000; and the undiscounted future net cash
flows associated with the factory total USD10,000,000. Under IFRS, an impairment
charge of USD4,000,000 would be recorded; under US GAAP, however, no impairment
charge would be recognized.
    Thus, on its face, IFRS would be regarded as more conservative than US GAAP
because impairment losses normally would be recognized earlier under IFRS than
under US GAAP. But, taking the analysis one step further, such a broad generalization
may not hold up. For example, if an asset is impaired under both IFRS and US GAAP,
and the asset’s value in use exceeds its fair value, the impairment loss under US GAAP
will be greater. Also, IFRS permits the recognition of recoveries of the recoverable
amount in subsequent periods if evidence indicates that the recoverable amount has
subsequently increased. In contrast, US GAAP prohibits the subsequent write-up of
an asset after an impairment charge has been taken; it would recognize the asset’s
increased value only when the asset is ultimately sold.
    Common examples of conservatism in accounting standards include the following:
    ■   Research costs. Because the future benefit of research costs is uncertain at
        the time the costs are incurred, both US GAAP and IFRS require immediate
        expensing instead of capitalization.
    ■   Litigation losses. When it becomes “probable” that a cost will be incurred,
        both US GAAP and IFRS require expense recognition, even though a legal
        liability may not be incurred until a future date.
    ■   Insurance recoverables. Generally, a company that receives payment on an
        insurance claim may not recognize a receivable until the insurance company
        acknowledges the validity of the claimed amount.
   Watts (2003) reviews empirical studies of conservatism and identifies the following
four potential benefits of conservatism:
    ■   Given asymmetrical information, conservatism may protect the contracting
        parties with less information and greater risk. This protection is neces-
        sary because the contracting party may be at a disadvantage. For example,
        corporations that access debt markets have limited liability, and lenders thus
        have limited recourse to recover their losses from shareholders. As another

                                   example, executives who receive earnings-based bonuses might not be
                                   subject to having those bonuses “clawed back” if earnings are subsequently
                                   discovered to be overstated.
                               ■   Conservatism reduces the possibility of litigation and, by extension, litiga-
                                   tion costs. Rarely, if ever, is a company sued because it understated good
                                   news or overstated bad news.
                               ■   Conservative rules may protect the interests of regulators and politicians
                                   by reducing the possibility that fault will be found with them if companies
                                   overstate earnings or assets.
                               ■   In many tax jurisdictions, financial and tax reporting rules are linked. For
                                   example, in Germany and Japan, only deductions taken against reported
                                   income can be deducted against taxable income. Hence, companies can
                                   reduce the present value of their tax payments by electing conservative
                                   accounting policies for certain types of events.
                               Analysts should consider possible conservative and aggressive biases and their
                           consequences when examining financial reports. Current-period financial reports
                           may be unbiased, upward biased through aggressive accounting choices, downward
                           biased through conservative accounting choices, or biased through a combination of
                           conservative and aggressive accounting choices.


                           Bias in the Application of Accounting Standards
                           Any application of accounting standards, whether or not the standard is neutral, often
                           requires significant amounts of judgment. Characterizing the application of an account-
                           ing standard as conservative or aggressive is more a matter of intent than definition.
                               Careful analysis of disclosures, facts, and circumstances contributes to making an
                           accurate inference of intent. Management seeking to manipulate earnings may take a
                           longer view by sacrificing short-term profitability in order to ensure higher profits in
                           later periods. One example of biased accounting in the guise of conservatism is the
                           so-called big bath restructuring charge. Both US GAAP and IFRS provide for accrual
                           of future costs associated with restructurings, and these costs are often associated with
                           and presented along with asset impairments. But in some instances, companies use
                           the accounting provisions to estimate “big” losses in the period under review so that
                           performance in future periods will appear better. Having observed numerous instances
                           of manipulative practices in the late 1990s, in which US companies set up opportunities
                           to report higher profits in future periods that were not connected with performance
                           in those periods, the SEC staff issued rules that narrowed the circumstances under
                           which costs can be categorized as part of a “non-recurring” restructuring event and
                           enhanced the transparency surrounding restructuring charges and asset impairments.11
                               A similar manifestation of big bath accounting is often referred to as “cookie jar
                           reserve accounting.” Both US GAAP and IFRS require accruals of estimates of future
                           non-payments of loans. In his 1998 speech “The Numbers Game,” SEC chair Arthur
                           Levitt expressed the general concern that corporations were overstating loans and other
                           forms of loss allowances for the purpose of smoothing income over time.12 In 2003,
                           the SEC issued interpretive guidance that essentially requires a company to provide
                           a separate section in management discussion and analysis (MD&A) titled “Critical

CONTEXT FOR ASSESSING FINANCIAL REPORTING
QUALITY                                                                                                        7
                 describe motivations that might cause management to issue financial
                 reports that are not high quality and conditions that are conducive to
                 issuing low-quality, or even fraudulent, financial reports

In assessing financial reporting quality, it is useful to consider whether a company’s
managers may be motivated to issue financial reports that are not high quality. If
motivation exists, an analyst should consider whether the reporting environment is
conducive to managers’ misreporting. It is important to consider mechanisms within
the reporting environment that discipline financial reporting quality, such as the
regulatory regime.


Motivations
Managers may be motivated to issue financial reports that are not high quality to
mask poor performance, such as a loss of market share or lower profitability than
competitors. As Lewis (2012) stated, “A firm experiencing performance problems,
particularly those it considers transient, may induce a response that inflates current
earnings numbers in exchange for lower future earnings.”
    ■    Even when there is no need to mask poor performance, managers frequently
         have incentives to meet or beat market expectations as reflected in analysts’
         forecasts or management’s own forecasts. Exceeding forecasts may increase
         the stock price, if only temporarily. Additionally, exceeding forecasts can
         increase management compensation that is linked to increases in stock price
         or to reported earnings. Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal (2005) found that
         the chief financial officers (CFOs) they surveyed view earnings as the most
         important financial metric to financial markets. Achieving (or exceeding)
         particular benchmarks, including prior-year earnings and analysts’ fore-
         casts, is very important. The authors examined a variety of motivations
         for why managers might “exercise accounting discretion to achieve some
         desirable earnings goal.” Motivations to meet earnings benchmarks include
         equity market effects (e.g., building credibility with market participants and
         positively affecting stock price) and trade effects (e.g., enhancing reputation
         with customers and suppliers). Equity market effects are the most pow-
         erful incentives, but trade effects are important, particularly for smaller
         companies.

                              ■   Career concerns and incentive compensation may motivate accounting
                                  choices. For example, managers might be concerned that working for a
                                  company that performs poorly will limit their future career opportunities or
                                  that they will not receive a bonus based on exceeding a particular earnings
                                  target. In both cases, management might be motivated to make accounting
                                  choices to increase earnings. In a period of marginally poor performance,
                                  a manager might accelerate or inflate revenues or delay or under-report
                                  expenses. Conversely, in a period of strong performance, a manager might
                                  delay revenue recognition or accelerate expense recognition to increase
                                  the probability of exceeding the next period’s targets (i.e., to “bank” some
                                  earnings for the next period.) The surveyed managers indicated a greater
                                  concern with career implications of reported results than with incentive
                                  compensation implications.
                               Avoiding debt covenant violations can motivate managers to inflate earnings.
                           Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal’s survey indicates that avoidance of bond covenant
                           violation is important to highly leveraged and unprofitable companies but relatively
                           unimportant overall.


                           Conditions Conducive to Issuing Low-Quality Financial Reports
                           As discussed, deviations from a neutral presentation of financial results could be driven
                           by management choices or by a jurisdiction’s financial reporting standards. Ultimately,
                           a decision to issue low-quality, or even fraudulent, financial reports is made by an
                           individual or individuals. Why individuals make such choices is not always immedi-
                           ately apparent. For example, why would the newly appointed CEO of Sunbeam, who
                           already had a net worth of more than USD100 million, commit accounting fraud by
                           improperly reporting revenues from “bill-and-hold” sales and manipulating the timing
                           of expenses, rather than admit to lower-than-expected financial results?
                               Typically, three conditions exist when low-quality financial reports are issued:
                           opportunity, pressure or motivation, and rationalization—sometimes referred to as
                           the fraud triangle. Opportunity can be the result of internal conditions, such as poor
                           internal controls or an ineffective board of directors, or external conditions, such as
                           accounting standards that provide scope for divergent choices or minimal consequences
                           for an inappropriate choice. Motivation can result from pressure to meet some criteria
                           for personal reasons, such as a bonus, or corporate reasons, such as concern about
                           financing in the future. Rationalization is important because if a decision maker is
                           concerned about a choice, that person needs to be able to justify it to him- or herself.
                               Former Enron CFO Andrew Fastow, speaking at the 2013 Association of Certified
                           Fraud Examiners Annual Fraud Conference, indicated that he knew at the time he was
                           doing something wrong but followed procedure to justify his decision (Pavlo, 2013).
                           He made sure to get management and board approval, as well as legal and accounting
                           opinions, and to include appropriate disclosures. The incentive and corporate culture
                           was to create earnings rather than focus on long-term value. Clearly, as reflected in
                           his prison sentence, he did something that was not only wrong but illegal.

MECHANISMS THAT DISCIPLINE FINANCIAL
REPORTING QUALITY                                                                                  8
               describe mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality and
               the potential limitations of those mechanisms

Markets may discipline poor financial reporting quality. Companies and nations com-
pete for capital, and the cost of capital is a function of perceived risk—including the
risk that a company’s financial statements will skew investors’ expectations. Thus, in
the absence of other conflicting economic incentives, a company seeking to minimize
its long-term cost of capital should aim to provide high-quality financial reports. In
addition to markets, other mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality
include market regulatory authorities, auditors, and private contracts.


Market Regulatory Authorities
Companies seeking to minimize the cost of capital should maximize reporting quality,
but as discussed earlier, conflicting incentives often exist. For this reason, national
regulations, and the regulators that establish and enforce rules, can play a significant
role in financial reporting quality. Many of the world’s securities regulators are mem-
bers of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). IOSCO
is recognized as the “global standard setter for the securities sector” although it does
not actually set standards but rather establishes objectives and principles to guide
securities and capital market regulation. IOSCO’s membership includes more than
120 securities regulators and 80 other securities market participants, such as stock
exchanges.14
    One member of IOSCO is The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA),
an independent EU authority with a mission to “enhance the protection of investors
and reinforce stable and well-functioning financial markets in the European Union.”15
ESMA organizes financial reporting enforcement activities through a forum consisting
of European enforcers from European Economic Area countries. Direct supervision and
enforcement activities are performed at the national level. For example, the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA) is the IOSCO member with primary responsibility for
securities regulation in the United Kingdom. ESMA reported that European enforcers
examined the interim or annual financial statements of 1,141 issuers in 2017, which
in turn led to enforcement actions for 328 issuers with the following outcomes: 12
required reissuances of financial statements, 71 required public corrective notes, and
245 required corrections to be made in future financial statements.16
    Another member of IOSCO is the US regulatory authority, the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The SEC is responsible for overseeing approximately 9,100
US public companies (along with investment advisers, broker/dealers, securities
exchanges, and other entities) and reviews the disclosures of these companies at least
once every three years with the aim of improving information available to investors

                           and potentially uncovering possible violations of securities laws.17 In 2017, the SEC
                           reported that it had filed 754 total and 446 standalone enforcement actions, about 20
                           percent of which concerned issuer reporting or accounting and auditing.18
                              Examples of regulatory bodies in Asia include the Financial Services Agency in
                           Japan, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the Securities and Exchange
                           Board of India. Examples of regulatory bodies in South America include the Comisión
                           Nacional de Valores in Argentina, Comissão de Valores Mobiliários in Brazil, and
                           Comisión para el Mercado Financiero in Chile. A full list of IOSCO members can be
                           found on the organization’s website.
                              Typical features of a regulatory regime that most directly affect financial reporting
                           quality include the following:
                               ■   Registration requirements. Market regulators typically require publicly
                                   traded companies to register securities before offering the securities for sale
                                   to the public. A registration document typically contains current financial
                                   statements, other relevant information about the risks and prospects of the
                                   company issuing the securities, and information about the securities being
                                   offered.
                               ■   Disclosure requirements. Market regulators typically require publicly traded
                                   companies to make public periodic reports, including financial reports and
                                   management comments. Standard-setting bodies, such as the IASB and
                                   FASB, are typically private sector, self-regulated organizations with board
                                   members who are experienced accountants, auditors, users of financial
                                   statements, and academics. Regulatory authorities, such as the Accounting
                                   and Corporate Regulatory Authority in Singapore, the Securities and
                                   Exchange Commission in the United States, the Securities and Exchange
                                   Commission in Brazil, and the Financial Reporting Council in the United
                                   Kingdom, have the legal authority to enforce financial reporting require-
                                   ments and exert other controls over entities that participate in the capital
                                   markets within their jurisdiction. In other words, generally, standard-setting
                                   bodies set the standards, and regulatory authorities recognize and enforce
                                   those standards. Without the recognition of standards by regulatory author-
                                   ities, the private-sector standard-setting bodies would have no authority.
                                   Regulators often retain the legal authority to establish financial report-
                                   ing standards in their jurisdiction and can overrule the private-sector
                                   standard-setting bodies.
                               ■   Auditing requirements. Market regulators typically require companies’
                                   financial statements to be accompanied by an audit opinion attesting that
                                   the financial statements conform to the relevant set of accounting standards.
                                   Some regulators, such as the SEC in the United States, require an additional
                                   audit opinion attesting to the effectiveness of the company’s internal con-
                                   trols over financial reporting.
                               ■   Management commentaries. Regulations typically require publicly traded
                                   companies’ financial reports to include statements by management. For
                                   example, the FCA in the United Kingdom requires a management report
                                   containing “(1) a fair review of the issuer’s business; and (2) a description of
                                   the principal risks and uncertainties facing the issuer” (Disclosure Guidance
                                   and Transparency Rules sourcebook).

Mechanisms That Discipline Financial Reporting Quality                                      341


    ■   Responsibility statements. Regulations typically require a statement from the
        person or persons responsible for the company’s filings. Such statements
        require the responsible individuals to explicitly acknowledge responsibility
        and to attest to the correctness of the financial reports. Some regulators,
        such as the SEC in the United States, require formal certifications that carry
        specific legal penalties for false certifications.
    ■   Regulatory review of filings. Regulators typically undertake a review process
        to ensure that the rules have been followed. The review process typically
        covers all initial registrations and a sample of subsequent periodic financial
        reports.
    ■   Enforcement mechanisms. Regulators are granted various powers to enforce
        the securities market rules. Such powers can include assessing fines, sus-
        pending or permanently barring market participants, and bringing criminal
        prosecutions. Public announcements of disciplinary actions are also a type
        of enforcement mechanism.
   In summary, market regulatory authorities play a central role in encouraging
high-quality financial reporting.


Auditors
As noted, regulatory authorities typically require that publicly traded companies’
financial statements be audited by an independent auditor. Private companies also
obtain audit opinions for their financial statements, either voluntarily or because audit
reports are required by an outside party, such as providers of debt or equity capital.
    Audit opinions provide financial statement users with some assurance that the
information complies with the relevant set of accounting standards and presents the
company’s information fairly. Exhibit 8 , Exhibit 9, Exhibit 10, and Exhibit 11 provide
excerpts from the independent auditors’ reports for GlaxoSmithKline plc, Alibaba
Group Holding Limited, Apple Inc., and Tata Motors Limited, respectively. For each
company, the auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements,
indicating that the financial statements present fairly the company’s performance in
accordance with relevant standards. (Note: The term “unqualified opinion” means that
the opinion did not include any qualifications or exceptions; the term is synonymous
with the less formal term “clean opinion.” Unqualified opinions are the most common
opinions issued.) Other items in the audit reports reflect the specific requirements of
the company’s regulatory regime. For example, the audit report for GlaxoSmithKline
spans nine pages and includes opinions on the company’s financial statements as
well as the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. This audit report also includes
disclosures about “Key audit matters,” in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (ISAs) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board
(IAASB) in 2015 and effective for periods ending on or after 15 December 2016.
    The excerpts for Alibaba, Apple, and Tata Motors show the auditors’ opinions on
the companies’ financial statements and additionally the SEC-required opinions on
the effectiveness of the companies’ internal controls because these companies are
listed in the United States. For Alibaba, a single report includes both unqualified
opinions: (1) the financial statements present fairly the financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows . . . in conformity with US GAAP; and (2) the company
maintained effective control over financial reporting. For Apple, the first report
includes the unqualified opinion on the financial statements, and the second report
includes the unqualified opinion on the company’s effective internal controls. For Tata
Motors, the first report includes the unqualified opinion that the financial statements
present the company’s position and results fairly in accordance with IFRS. (The SEC
permits non-US companies to report using US GAAP, IFRS as issued by the IASB, or
342   Learning Module 10                                                                  Financial Reporting Quality


                           home-country GAAP.) However, the second report includes an adverse opinion on the
                           effectiveness of the company’s internal controls: “In our opinion, because of the effect
                           of the material weakness . . . the company has not maintained effective internal control.”
                           The report explains that the material weakness involved a third party’s inappropriate
                           access to the company’s systems. The report further states that although the material
                           weakness resulted in ineffective internal controls, it did not affect the audit opinion
                           on the financial statements. Elsewhere in Tata Motors’ annual report (not shown in
                           the excerpt), the company discloses that the weakness did not result in misstatement
                           and that it has undertaken remedial measures.

                                  Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judge-
                              ment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the

                              statement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including
                              those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation
                              of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These
                              matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon,
                              were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole,
                              and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion
                              on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

                                  In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit,
                              the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the year
                              ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has
                              been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

                              nal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
                              a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements
                              will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness related

                                Although audit opinions provide discipline for financial reporting quality, inherent
                           limitations exist. First, an audit opinion is based on a review of information prepared
                           by the company. If a company deliberately intends to deceive its auditor, a review of
                           information might not uncover misstatements. Second, an audit is based on sampling,
                           and the sample might not reveal misstatements. Third, an “expectations gap” may
                           exist between the auditor’s role and the public’s expectation of auditors. An audit
                           is not typically intended to detect fraud; it is intended to provide assurance that the
                           financial reports are fairly presented. Finally, the company being audited pays the audit
                           fees, often established through a competitive process. This situation could provide an
                           auditor with an incentive to show leniency to the company being audited, particularly
                           if the auditor’s firm provides additional services to the company.
Mechanisms That Discipline Financial Reporting Quality                                              345



Private Contracting
Aspects of private contracts, such as loan agreements or investment contracts, can
also serve as mechanisms to discipline poor financial reporting quality. Many parties
that have a contractual arrangement with a company have an incentive to monitor
that company’s performance and to ensure that the company’s financial reports are
high quality. For example, loan agreements often contain loan covenants, which create
specifically tailored financial reporting requirements that are legally binding for the
issuer. As noted earlier, avoidance of debt covenant violation is a potential motivation
for managers to inflate earnings. As another example, an investment contract could
contain provisions giving investors the option to recover all or part of their invest-
ment if certain financial triggers occur. Such provisions could motivate the investee’s
managers to manipulate reported results to avoid the financial triggers.
    Because the financial reports prepared by the investees or borrowers directly
affect the contractual outcomes—potentially creating a motivation for misreporting—
investors and lenders are motivated to monitor financial reports and to ensure that
they are high quality.

EXAMPLE 4

   Financial Reporting Manipulation: Motivations and
   Disciplining Mechanisms
   For each of the following two scenarios, identify (1) factors that might motivate
   the company’s managers to manipulate reported financial amounts and (2)
   applicable mechanisms that could discipline poor financial reporting quality.

   1. ABC Co. is a private company. Bank NTBig has made a loan to ABC Co.
      ABC is required to maintain a minimum 2.0 interest coverage ratio. In its
      most recent financial reports, ABC reported earnings before interest and
      taxes of USD1,200 and interest expense of USD600. In the report’s notes,
      the company discloses that it changed the estimated useful life of its prop-
      erty, plant, and equipment during the year. Depreciation was approximately
      USD150 lower as a result of this change in estimate.
      Solution:
      The need to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.0 might
      motivate ABC’s managers to manipulate reported financial amounts. The
      company’s coverage ratio based on the reported amounts is exactly equal
      to 2.0. If ABC’s managers had not changed the estimated useful life of the
      property, plant, and equipment, the coverage ratio would have fallen below
      the required level.

    Impact on depreciation expense of changed assumptions
    about useful life                                                                 150
    EBIT, as adjusted                                                          USD1,050


    Interest expense                                                             USD600

    Coverage ratio, as adjusted                                                          1.75
                                                    ​




   The potential disciplining mechanisms include the auditors, who will assess the reasonableness
346   Learning Module 10                                                                                Financial Reporting Quality


                              of the depreciable lives estimates. In addition, the lenders will carefully scrutinize the change in
                              estimate because the company only barely achieved the minimum coverage ratio and would not
                              have achieved the minimum without the change in accounting estimate.



                              2. DEF Co. is a publicly traded company. For the most recent quarter, the aver-
                                 age of analysts’ forecasts for earnings per share was USD2.50. In its quarter-
                                 ly earnings announcement, DEF reported net income of USD3,458,780. The
                                 number of common shares outstanding was 1,378,000. DEF’s main product
                                 is a hardware device that includes a free two-year service contract in the
                                 selling price. Based on management estimates, the company allocates a
                                 portion of revenues to the hardware device, which it recognizes immediate-
                                 ly, and a portion to the service contract, which it defers and recognizes over
                                 the two years of the contract. Based on the disclosures, a higher percentage
                                 of revenue was allocated to hardware than in the past, with an estimated
                                 after-tax impact on net income of USD27,000.
                                 Solution:
                                 The desire to meet or exceed the average of analysts’ forecasts for earn-
                                 ings per share might motivate DEF Co.’s managers to manipulate reported
                                 financial amounts. As illustrated in the following calculations, the impact of
                                 allocating a greater portion of revenue to hardware enabled the company to
                                 exceed analysts’ earnings per share forecasts by USD0.01.
                                                                                 ​

              9            DETECTION OF FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY
                           ISSUES: INTRODUCTION AND PRESENTATION
                           CHOICES

                                            describe presentation choices, including non-GAAP measures, that
                                            could be used to influence an analyst’s opinion

                           Choices in the application of accounting standards abound, which is perhaps one
                           reason why accounting literature and texts are so voluminous. Compounding the
                           complexity, measurement often depends on estimates of economic phenomena. Two
                           estimates might be justifiable, but they may have significantly different effects on the
                           company’s financial statements. As discussed earlier, the choice of a particular estimate
Detection of Financial Reporting Quality Issues: Introduction and Presentation Choices     347


may depend on the motivations of the reporting company’s managers. With many
choices available, and the inherent flexibility of estimates in the accounting process,
managers have many tools for managing and meeting analysts’ expectations through
financial reporting.
    An understanding of the choices that companies make in financial reporting is
fundamental to evaluating the overall quality—both financial reporting and earnings
quality—of the reports produced. Choices exist both in how information is presented
(financial reporting quality) and in how financial results are calculated (earnings
quality). Choices in presentation (financial reporting quality) may be transparent to
investors. Choices in the calculation of financial results (earnings quality), however,
are more difficult to discern because they can be deeply embedded in the construction
of reported financial results.
    The availability of accounting choices enables managers to affect the reporting
of financial results. Some choices increase performance and financial position in
the reporting period (aggressive choices), and others increase them in later periods
(conservative choices). A manager who wants to increase performance and financial
position in the reporting period could:
    ■   recognize revenue prematurely;
    ■   use non-recurring transactions to increase profits;
    ■   defer expenses to later periods;
    ■   measure and report assets at higher values; and/or
    ■   measure and report liabilities at lower values.
    ■   A manager who wants to increase performance and financial position in a
        later period could:
    ■   defer current income to a later period (save income for a “rainy day”); and/
        or
    ■   recognize future expenses in a current period, setting the table for improv-
        ing future performance.
    This lesson describes some of the potential choices for how information is pre-
sented and how accounting elements [assets, liabilities, owners’ equity, revenue and
gains (income), and expenses and losses] are recognized, measured, and reported.
In addition to choices within GAAP, companies may prepare fraudulent reports. For
example, these reports may include non-existent revenue or assets. Later lessons
discuss warning signs that may indicate poor-quality financial reports.


Presentation Choices
The technology boom of the 1990s and the internet bubble of the early 2000s featured
companies, popular with investors, that often shared the same characteristic: They
could not generate enough current earnings to justify their stock prices using the tra-
ditional price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) approaches to valuation. Many investors chose
to explain these apparent anomalies by rationalizing that the old focus on profits and
traditional valuation approaches no longer applied to such companies. Strange new
metrics for determining operating performance emerged. Website operators spoke
of the “eyeballs” they had captured in a quarter, or the “stickiness” of their websites
for web surfers’ visits. Various versions of “pro forma earnings”—that is, “non-GAAP
earnings measures”—became a financial reporting staple of the era.
    Many technology companies were accomplished practitioners of pro forma report-
ing, but they were not the first to use it. In the early 1990s, downsizing of large com-
panies was a commonplace event, and massive restructuring charges obscured the
operating performance at many established companies. For example, as it learned
348   Learning Module 10                                                                  Financial Reporting Quality


                           to cope in a world that embraced the personal computer rather than mainframe
                           computing, International Business Machines (IBM) reported massive restructuring
                           charges in 1991, 1992, and 1993: USD3.7 billion, USD11.6 billion, and USD8.9 bil-
                           lion, respectively. IBM was not alone. Sears incurred USD2.7 billion of restructuring
                           charges in 1993, and AT&T reported restructuring charges of USD7.7 billion in
                           1995. These events were not isolated; restructuring charges were a standard quarterly
                           reporting event. To counter perceptions that their operations were floundering, and
                           supposedly to assist investors in evaluating operating performance, companies often
                           sanitized earnings releases by excluding restructuring charges in pro forma measures
                           of financial performance.
                               Accounting principles for reporting business combinations also played a role in
                           boosting the popularity of pro forma earnings. Before 2001, acquisitions of one com-
                           pany by another often resulted in goodwill amortization charges that made subsequent
                           earnings reports look weak. Complicating matters, there were two accounting methods
                           for recording acquisitions: pooling-of-interests and purchase methods. The now-extinct
                           pooling-of-interests treatment was difficult for companies to achieve because of the
                           many restrictive criteria for its use, but it was greatly desired because it did not result
                           in goodwill amortization charges. In the technology boom period, acquisitions were
                           common and many were reported as purchases, with consequential goodwill amor-
                           tization dragging down earnings for as long as 40 years under the then-existing rules.
                           Acquisitive companies reporting under purchase accounting standards perceived
                           themselves to be at a reporting disadvantage compared with companies able to apply
                           pooling-of-interests. They responded by presenting earnings adjusted for the exclusion
                           of amortization of intangible assets and goodwill.
                               Because investors try to make intercompany comparisons on a consistent basis,
                           earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) has become
                           an extremely popular performance measure. EBITDA is widely viewed as eliminating
                           noisy reporting signals. That noise may be introduced by different accounting methods
                           among companies for depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring
                           charges. Companies may construct and report their own version of EBITDA, some-
                           times referring to it as “adjusted EBITDA,” by adding to the list of items to exclude
                           from net income. Items that analysts might encounter include the following:
                               ■   rental payments for operating leases, resulting in EBITDAR (earnings before
                                   interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rentals);
                               ■   equity-based compensation, usually justified on the grounds that it is a
                                   non-cash expense;
                               ■   acquisition-related charges;
                               ■   impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets;
                               ■   impairment charges for long-lived assets;
                               ■   litigation costs; and
                               ■   loss/gain on debt extinguishments.
                                Among other incentives for the spread of non-GAAP earnings measures are loan
                           covenants. Lenders may make demands on a borrowing company that require achieving
                           and maintaining performance criteria that use GAAP net income as a starting point
                           but arrive at a measure suitable to the lender. The company may use this measure
                           as its preferred non-GAAP metric in earnings releases and also when describing its
                           liquidity or solvency situation in the management commentary (called management
                           discussion and analysis in the United States).
                                As mentioned earlier, if a company uses a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC
                           filing, it must display the most directly comparable GAAP measure with equal promi-
                           nence and provide a reconciliation between the two. Management must explain why it

believes that the non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information regarding
the company’s financial condition and operations. Management must also disclose
additional purposes, if material, for which it uses the non-GAAP financial measures.
    Similarly, IFRS requires a definition and explanation of any non-IFRS measures
included in financial reports, including why the measure is potentially relevant to
users. Management must provide reconciliations of non-IFRS measures with IFRS
measures. The concern is that management may use non-GAAP measures to distract
attention from GAAP measures.
    The SEC intended that the definition of non-GAAP financial measures would
capture all measures with the effect of depicting either:
    ■    a measure of performance that differs from that presented in the financial
         statements, such as income or loss before taxes or net income or loss, as
         calculated in accordance with GAAP; or
    ■    a measure of liquidity that differs from cash flow or cash flow from opera-
         tions computed in accordance with GAAP.19
    The SEC prohibits the exclusion of charges or liabilities requiring cash settlement
from any non-GAAP liquidity measures, other than EBIT and EBITDA. Also prohib-
ited is the calculation of a non-GAAP performance measure intended to eliminate or
smooth items tagged as non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual when such items are
very likely to occur again. The SEC views the period within two years of either before
or after the reporting date as the relevant time frame for considering whether a charge
or gain is a recurring item. Example 5 describes a case of misuse and misreporting
of non-GAAP measures.

EXAMPLE 5

   Misuse and Misreporting of Non-GAAP Measures
   Groupon is an online discount merchant. In the company’s initial S-1 registra-
   tion statement in 2011, then-CEO Andrew Mason gave prospective investors
   an upfront warning in a section entitled “We don’t measure ourselves in con-
   ventional ways”, which described Groupon’s adjusted consolidated segment
   operating income (adjusted CSOI) measure. Exhibit 12 provides excerpts from
   a section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” which offered a more
   detailed explanation. Exhibit 13, also from the initial registration statement,
   shows a reconciliation of CSOI to the most comparable US GAAP measure.
   In its review, the SEC took the position that online marketing expenses were a
   recurring cost of business. Groupon responded that the marketing costs were
   similar to acquisition costs, not recurring costs, and that “we’ll ramp down
   marketing just as fast as we ramped it up, reducing the customer acquisition
   part of our marketing expenses” as time passes.20
       Eventually, and after much negative publicity, Groupon changed its non-
   GAAP measure. Exhibit 14 shows an excerpt from the final prospectus filed in
   November, after the SEC’s review. Use the three exhibits to answer the questions
   that follow.

                               Adjusted CSOI is operating income of our two segments, North America
                           and International, adjusted for online marketing expense, acquisition-re-
                           lated costs and stock-based compensation expense. Online marketing
                           expense primarily represents the cost to acquire new subscribers and is
                           dictated by the amount of growth we wish to pursue. Acquisition-related
                           costs are non-recurring non-cash items related to certain of our acquisi-
                           tions. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash item. We consider
                           Adjusted CSOI to be an important measure of the performance of our busi-
                           ness as it excludes expenses that are non-cash or otherwise not indicative
                           of future operating expenses. We believe it is important to view Adjusted
                           CSOI as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of operations.
                               Our use of Adjusted CSOI has limitations as an analytical tool, and you
                           should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis
                           of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
                           ■   Adjusted CSOI does not reflect the significant cash investments
                               that we currently are making to acquire new subscribers;
                           ■   Adjusted CSOI does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of
                               issuing equity-based compensation to our management team and
                               employees or in connection with acquisitions;
                           ■   Adjusted CSOI does not reflect any interest expense or the cash
                               requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on
                               any indebtedness that we may incur;
                           ■   Adjusted CSOI does not reflect any foreign exchange gains and
                               losses;
                           ■   Adjusted CSOI does not reflect any tax payments that we might
                               make, which would represent a reduction in cash available to us;
                           ■   Adjusted CSOI does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements
                               for, our working capital needs; and
                           ■    Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calcu-
                                late Adjusted CSOI differently or may use other financial measures
                                to evaluate their profitability, which reduces the usefulness of it as a
                                comparative measure.
                               Because of these limitations, Adjusted CSOI should not be considered
                           as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth
                           of our business. When evaluating our performance, you should consider
                           Adjusted CSOI alongside other financial performance measures, including
                           various cash flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.

   1. What cautions did Groupon include along with its description of the adjust-
      ed CSOI metric?
      Solution:
      Groupon cautioned that the adjusted CSOI metric should not be consid-
      ered in isolation, should not be considered as a substitute for analysis using
      GAAP results, and “should not be considered a measure of discretionary
      cash flow.” The company lists numerous limitations, primarily citing items
      that adjusted CSOI did not reflect.
352   Learning Module 10                                                                Financial Reporting Quality


                             2. Groupon excludes “online marketing” from adjusted CSOI. How does the
                                exclusion of this expense compare with the SEC’s limits on non-GAAP per-
                                formance measures?
                                Solution:
                                The SEC specifies that non-GAAP measures should not eliminate items
                                tagged as non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual when such items may be
                                very likely to occur again. Because the online marketing expense occurred
                                in every period reported and is likely to occur again, exclusion of this item
                                appears contrary to SEC requirements.

                             3. In the first quarter of 2011, what was the effect of excluding online market-
                                ing expenses on the calculation of adjusted CSOI?
                                Solution:
                                As shown in Exhibit 13, in the first quarter of 2011, the exclusion of the
                                online marketing expense was enough to swing the company from a net loss
                                under US GAAP reporting to a profit—at least, a profit as defined by ad-
                                justed CSOI. Using adjusted CSOI as a performance measure, the company
                                showed results that were 35 percent higher for the first quarter of 2011 com-
                                pared with the entire previous year.

                             4. For 2010, how did results under the revised non-GAAP metric compare
                                with the originally reported metric?
                                Solution:
                                As shown in Exhibit 14, the revised metric is now called CSOI and no longer
                                refers to adjusted CSOI. For 2010, results under the revised non-GAAP met-
                                ric, which includes online marketing costs, shows a loss of USD180,993,000
                                instead of a profit of USD60,553,000.

                               In Example 5, Groupon changed its reporting and corrected the non-GAAP metric
                           that the SEC had identified as misleading. In other cases, the SEC has pursued enforce-
                           ment actions against companies for reporting misleading non-GAAP information. One
                           such action was brought in 2009 against SafeNet Inc., in which the SEC charged the
                           company with improperly classifying ordinary operating expenses as non-recurring.
                           This related to the integration of an acquired company and exclusion of the expenses
                           from non-GAAP earnings to exceed earnings targets. A second action was brought
                           by the SEC in 2017 against MDC Partners Inc. (MDCA) for improper reconciliation
                           of a non-GAAP measure and for improperly displaying the non-GAAP measure with
                           greater prominence in its earnings releases. The case was brought after the company

    In general, management may choose to construct non-GAAP financial measures
not only to help investors better understand the company’s performance but also to
paint a more flattering picture of its performance. In some cases, management may
attempt to present non-GAAP measures in a way that diverts attention from the
standards-compliant financial information that it is required to present.




ACCOUNTING CHOICES AND ESTIMATES
                                                                                         10
              describe accounting methods (choices and estimates) that could be
              used to manage earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items

Management’s accounting policies and choices do not necessarily involve complex
accounting standards. Something as simple as the shipping terms for goods delivered
to customers can have a profound effect on the timing of revenue. On the last day of
the first quarter, suppose a company ships USD10,000 of goods to a customer on the
terms “free on board (FOB) shipping point,” arriving the next day. This shipping term
means that the customer takes title to the goods, and bears the risk of loss, at the
time the goods leave the seller’s loading dock. Barring any issues with collectability

                           of the receivable, or a likelihood of a return, the seller would be able to recognize
                           revenue on the sale along with the associated profit. That revenue and profit would
                           be recognized in the first quarter of the year. If the point at which the goods’ title
                           transfers to the customer is changed to “FOB destination,” then the revenue pattern
                           will be completely different. Under these terms, the title—and risk of loss—transfers
                           to the customer when the goods arrive at their destination, which is the customer’s
                           address. The seller cannot recognize the sale and profit until the shipment arrives the
                           following day, which is the start of a new accounting period.
                               A simple change in shipping terms can make the difference between revenue and
                           profits in the reporting period or postponing them until the next period. Shipping terms
                           can also influence management behavior. To “make the numbers,” managers might
                           push product out the door prematurely under FOB shipping point arrangements to
                           reflect as much revenue as possible in the reporting period. Alternatively, in the case
                           of an over-abundance of orders, the company could run the risk of exceeding analysts’
                           consensus estimates by a large margin. Management might be uncomfortable with this
                           situation because investors might extrapolate too much from one reporting period
                           in which expectations were exceeded. Management might want to prevent investors
                           from becoming too optimistic and, if possible, delay revenue recognition until the next
                           quarter. This result could be accomplished by fulfilling customer orders by initiating
                           delivery on the last day of the quarter, with shipping terms set as FOB destination.
                           By doing so, title would transfer in the next accounting period. Another possibility in
                           this scenario is that if the customers insisted on FOB shipping point terms, the selling
                           company could simply delay shipment until after the close of the quarter.
                               This illustration also highlights a difficult distinction for investors to make. A
                           company may use accounting as a tool to aggressively promote earnings growth—as
                           in the example with the premature shipment of goods with FOB shipping point
                           terms—but it may be aggressively managing the business flow by slacking off on
                           shipping goods when business is “too good,” as in the second example. In either case,
                           a desired management outcome is obtained by a simple change in shipping terms.
                           Yet, many investors might be inclined to say that the second example is a conservative
                           kind of earnings management and accept it, even though it artificially masks the actual
                           economic activity that occurred at the time.


                           How Accounting Choices and Estimates Affect Earnings and
                           Balance Sheets
                           Assumptions about inventory cost flows provide another example of how accounting
                           choices can affect financial reporting. Companies may assume that their purchases
                           of inventory items are sold to customers on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, with
                           the result that the remaining inventory reflects the most recent costs. Alternatively,
                           they may assume that their purchases of inventory items are sold to customers on a
                           weighted-average cost basis. Example 6 makes the point that merely choosing a cost
                           flow assumption can affect profitability.

                           EXAMPLE 6

                             Effect of Cost Flow Assumption
                             A company starts operations with no inventory at the beginning of a fiscal
                             year and makes purchases of a good for resale five times during the period at
                             increasing prices. Each purchase is for the same number of units of the good.
                             The purchases, and the cost of goods available for sale, appear in the following
                             table. Notice that the price per unit has increased by 140 percent by the end
                             of the period.

      During the period, the company sells, at USD250 each, all of the goods
  purchased except for five of them. Although the ending inventory consists of
  five units, the cost attached to those units can vary greatly.

  1. What are the ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses
     the FIFO method of inventory costing?
     Solution:
     The ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the FIFO
     method of inventory costing are USD1,200 and USD3,150.

  2. What are the ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses
     the weighted-average method of inventory costing?
     Solution:
     The ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the weight-
     ed-average method of inventory costing are USD870 and USD3,480.

  3. Compare cost of goods sold and gross profit calculated under the two
     methods.
     Solution:
     The following table shows how the choice of inventory costing methods—
     FIFO versus weighted average—affects the cost of goods sold and gross
     profit.

    Cost of goods sold                                 USD3,150             USD3,480
    Sales                                              USD5,000             USD5,000
    Cost of goods sold                                    3,150                  3,480
    Gross profit                                       USD1,850             USD1,520
    Gross profit margin                                      37.0%                  30.4%
                                                   ​




  Note: Average inventory cost is calculated as Cost of goods available for sale/Units purchased =
  $4,350/25 = $174. There are five units in ending inventory, yielding an inventory value of $870.

     Depending on which cost flow assumption the company uses, the
     end-of-period inventory is either USD870 (under the weighted-average
     method) or USD1,200 (under FIFO). The choice of method results in a dif-
     ference of USD330 in gross profit and 6.6 percent in gross profit margin.

                                The previous example is simplified and extreme for purposes of illustration clar-
                           ity, but the point is important: Management’s choice among acceptable inventory
                           assumptions and methods affects profit. The selection of an inventory costing method
                           is a policy decision, and companies cannot arbitrarily switch from one method to
                           another. The selection does matter to profitability, however, and it also matters to
                           the balance sheet.
                                In periods of changing prices, the FIFO cost assumption will provide a more
                           current picture of ending inventory value, because the most recent purchases will
                           remain in inventory. The balance sheet will be more relevant to investors. Under the
                           weighted-average cost assumption, however, the balance sheet will display a blend
                           of old and new costs. During inflationary periods, the value of the inventory will be
                           understated: The company will not be able to replenish its inventory at the value shown.
                           At the same time, the weighted-average inventory cost method ensures that the more
                           current costs are shown in cost of sales, making the income statement more relevant
                           than under the FIFO assumption. Trade-offs exist, and investors should be aware
                           of how accounting choices affect financial reports. High-quality financial reporting
                           provides users with sufficient information to assess the effects of accounting choices.
                                Estimates abound in financial reporting because of the use of accrual accounting,
                           which attempts to show the effects of all economic events on a company during a
                           particular period. Accrual accounting stands in contrast to cash basis accounting,
                           which shows only the cash transactions conducted by a company. Although a high
                           degree of certainty exists with reporting only cash transactions, much information is
                           hidden. For instance, a company with growing revenues that makes the majority of its
                           sales on credit would be understating its revenues for each period if it reported only
                           cash transactions. On an accrual basis, revenues reflect all transactions that occurred,
                           whether they transacted on a cash basis or credit-extended basis. Estimates enter the
                           process because some facts related to events occurring in a particular period might
                           not yet be known. Estimates can be well grounded in reality and applied to present a
                           complete picture of the events affecting a company, or they can be management tools
                           for achieving a desired financial picture.
                                To illustrate how estimates can affect financial reporting, consider sales made on
                           credit. A company sells USD1,000,000 of merchandise on credit and records the sale
                           just before year end. Under accrual accounting, that amount is included in revenues
                           and accounts receivable. The company’s managers know from experience that they
                           will never collect every dollar of the accounts receivable. Past experience is that, on
                           average, only 97 percent of accounts receivable is collected. The company would esti-
                           mate an amount of the uncollectible accounts at the time the sales occur and record
                           an uncollectible accounts expense of USD30,000, lowering earnings. The other side of
                           the entry would be to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts of USD30,000.
                           This allowance would be a contra asset account, presented as an offset to accounts
                           receivable. The accounts receivable, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts,
                           would be stated at USD970,000, which is the amount of cash the company ultimately
                           expects to receive. If cash-basis accounting had been used, no revenues or accounts
                           receivable would have been reported even though sales of merchandise had occurred.
                           Accrual accounting, which contains estimates about future events, provides a much
                           fuller picture of what transpired in the period than pure cash-basis accounting.
                                Yet, accrual accounting poses temptations to managers to manage the numbers,
                           rather than to manage the business. Suppose a company’s managers realize that the
                           company will not meet analysts’ consensus estimates in a particular quarter, and further,
                           their bonus pay is dependent on reaching specified earnings targets. By offering special
                           payment terms, or discounts, the managers may induce customers to take delivery
                           of products that they normally would not order, so they could ship the products on
                           FOB shipping point terms and recognize the revenues in the current quarter. They
                           could even be so bold as to ship the goods under those terms even if the customer did

company’s property with FOB shipping point terms.
    To further improve earnings in order to meet the consensus estimates, the compa-
ny’s managers might revise their estimate of the uncollectible accounts. The company’s
collection history shows a typical non-collection rate of 3 percent of sales, but the
managers might rationalize the use of a 2 percent non-collection rate. This change
will reduce the allowance for uncollectible accounts and the expense reported for the
period. The managers might be able to justify the reduction on the grounds that the
sales occurred in a part of the country that was experiencing an improved economic
outlook, or that the company’s collection history had been biased by the inclusion
of a prolonged period of economic downturn. Whatever the justification, it would
be hard to prove that the new estimate was completely right or wrong until time had
passed. Because proof of the reliability of estimates is rarely available at the time
the estimate is recorded, managers have a readily available means for manipulating
earnings at their discretion.
    ConAgra Foods Inc. provides an example of how the allowance for uncollectible
accounts may be manipulated to manage earnings.21 A subsidiary, called United
Agri-Products (UAP), engaged in several improper accounting practices, one of them
being the understatement of uncollectible account expenses for several years. Exhibit
16 presents an excerpt from the SEC’s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release.

 Exhibit 16: SEC’s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Regarding
 United Agri-Products

   Generally, UAP’s policy required that accounts which were past due between 90
   days and one year should be reserved at 50%, and accounts over one year past
   due were to be reserved at 100%.
       … In FY 1999 and continuing through FY 2000, UAP had substantial bad debt
   problems. In FY 2000, certain former UAP senior executives were informed that
   UAP needed to record an additional $50 million of bad debt expense. Certain
   former UAP senior executives were aware that in FY 1999 the size of the bad
   debt at certain IOCs had been substantial enough that it could have negatively
   impacted those IOC’s ability to achieve PBT (profits before taxes) targets. In
   addition, just prior to the end of UAP’s FY 2000, the former UAP COO (chief
   operating officer), in the presence of other UAP employees, ordered that UAP’s
   bad debt reserve be reduced by $7 million in order to assist the Company in
   meeting its PBT target for the fiscal year.
       … At the end of FY 2000, former UAP senior executives reported financial
   results to ConAgra which they knew, or were reckless in not knowing, overstated
   UAP’s income before income taxes because UAP had failed to record sufficient
   bad debt expense. The misconduct with respect to bad debt expense caused
   ConAgra to overstate its reported income before income taxes by $7 million, or
   1.13%, in FY 2000. At the Agricultural Products’ segment level, the misconduct
   caused that segment’s reported operating profit to be overstated by 5.05%.

    Deferred-tax assets provide a similar example of choices in estimates affecting
the earnings outcome. Deferred-tax assets may arise when a company reports a net
operating loss under tax accounting rules. A company may record a deferred-tax asset
based on the expectation that losses in the reporting period will offset expected future

                           profits and reduce the company’s future income tax liability. Accounting standards
                           require that the deferred tax asset be reduced by a “valuation allowance” to account
                           for the possibility that the company will not be able to generate enough profit to use
                           all of the available tax benefits.22
                               Assume a company loses EUR1 billion in 2012, generating a net operating loss
                           of the same amount for tax purposes. The company’s income tax rate is 25 percent,
                           and it will be able to apply the net operating loss to its taxable income for the next
                           10 years. The net operating loss results in a deferred tax asset with a nominal value
                           of EUR250 million (25% × EUR1,000,000,000). Initial recognition would result in a
                           deferred tax asset of EUR250 million and a credit to deferred tax expense of EUR250
                           million. The company must address the question of whether or not the EUR250 million
                           will ever be completely applied to future income. It may be experiencing increased
                           competition and other circumstances that resulted in the EUR1 billion loss, and it
                           may be unreasonable to assume it will have taxable income against which to apply the
                           loss. In fact, the company’s managers might believe it is reasonable to assume only
                           that it will survive for five years, and with marginal profitability. The EUR250 million
                           deferred tax asset is thus overstated if no valuation allowance is recorded to offset it.
                               The managers believe that only EUR100 million of the net operating losses actually
                           will be applied to the company’s taxable income. That belief implies that only EUR25
                           million of the tax benefits will ever be realized. The deferred tax assets reported
                           on the balance sheet should not exceed this amount. The company should record
                           a valuation allowance of EUR225 million, which would offset the deferred tax asset
                           balance of EUR250 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset balance of EUR25
                           million. There also would be a EUR225 million credit to the deferred tax provision. It
                           is important to understand that the valuation allowance should be revised whenever
                           facts and circumstances change.
                               The ultimate value of the deferred tax asset is driven by management’s outlook
                           for the future—and that outlook may be influenced by other factors. If the company
                           needs to stay in compliance with debt covenants and needs every euro of value that
                           can be justified by the outlook, its managers may take a more optimistic view of
                           the future and keep the valuation allowance artificially low (in other words, the net
                           deferred tax asset high).
                               PowerLinx Inc. provides an example of how over-optimism about the realizability
                           of a deferred tax asset can lead to misstated financial reports. PowerLinx was a maker
                           of security video cameras, underwater cameras, and accessories. Aside from fraudu-
                           lently reporting 90 percent of its fiscal year 2000 revenue, PowerLinx had problems
                           with valuation of its deferred tax assets. Exhibit 17 provides an excerpt from the SEC’s
                           Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release with emphasis added.23

                            Exhibit 17: SEC’s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Regarding
                            PowerLinx

                              PowerLinx improperly recorded on its fiscal year 2000 balance sheet a deferred
                              tax asset of $1,439,322 without any valuation allowance. The tax asset was mate-
                              rial, representing almost forty percent of PowerLinx’s total assets of $3,841,944.
                              PowerLinx also recorded deferred tax assets of $180,613, $72,907, and $44,921,
                              respectively, in its financial statements for the first three quarters of 2000.

       PowerLinx did not have a proper basis for recording the deferred tax assets.
   The company had accumulated significant losses in 2000 and had no historical
   operating basis from which to conclude that it would be profitable in future
   years. Underwater camera sales had declined significantly and the company had
   devoted most of its resources to developing its SecureView product. The sole
   basis for PowerLinx’s “expectation” of future profitability was the purported $9
   million backlog of SecureView orders, which management assumed would gen-
   erate taxable income; however, this purported backlog, which predated Bauer’s
   hiring, did not reflect actual demand for SecureView cameras and, consequently,
   was not a reasonable or reliable indicator of future profitability.

    Another example of misstated financial results caused by improper reflection of
the realizability of a deferred tax asset occurred with Hampton Roads Bankshares
Inc. (HRBS), a commercial bank with deteriorating loan portfolio quality and com-
mensurate losses in the years following the financial crisis. The company reported a
deferred tax asset related to its loan losses; however, it did not establish a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax asset. This decision was based on dubious projec-
tions indicating that the company would earn the necessary future taxable income
“to fully utilize the [deferred tax asset] DTA over the applicable carry-forward peri-
od.”24 Over time, it became clear that the earnings projections were not realistic, and
ultimately the company restated its financial results to include a valuation allowance
against almost the entire deferred tax asset. Exhibit 18 presents an excerpt from the
company’s amended Form 10-Q/A containing the restatement.

   NOTE B – RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   Subsequent to filing the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year
   ended December 31, 2009 and its Form 10-Q for the three months ended March
   31, 2010 the Company determined that a valuation allowance on its deferred tax
   assets should be recognized as of December 31, 2009. The Company decided
   to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset because it is
   uncertain when it will realize this asset.
       Accordingly, the December 31, 2009 consolidated balance sheet and the
   March 31, 2010 consolidated financial statements have been restated to account

                                       Another example of how choices and estimates can affect reported results lies in
                                  the selection of a depreciation method for allocating the cost of long-lived assets to
                                  accounting periods subsequent to their acquisition. A company’s managers may choose
                                  to depreciate long-lived assets (1) on a straight-line basis, with each year bearing the
                                  same amount of depreciation expense; (2) using an accelerated method, with greater
                                  depreciation expense recognition in the earlier part of an asset’s life; or (3) using an
                                  activity-based depreciation method, which allocates depreciation expense based on
                                  units of use or production. Depreciation expense is affected by another set of choices
                                  and estimates regarding the salvage value of the assets being depreciated. A salvage
                                  value of zero will always increase depreciation expense under any method compared
                                  with the choice of a non-zero salvage value.
                                       Assume a company invests USD1,000,000 in manufacturing equipment and expects
                                  it to have a useful economic life of 10 years. During its expected life, the equipment will
                                  produce 400,000 units of product, or USD2.50 depreciation expense per unit produced.
                                  When it is disposed of at the end of its expected life, the company’s managers expect
                                  to realize no value for the equipment. Exhibit 19 shows the differences in the three
                                  alternative methods of depreciation: straight-line, accelerated on a double-declining
                                  balance basis, and units-of-production method, with no salvage value assumed at the
                                  end of the equipment’s life.

The straight-line method allocates the cost of the equipment evenly to all 10 years of
the equipment’s life. The double-declining balance method will have a higher allocation
of cost to the earlier years of the equipment’s life. As its name implies, the depreciation
expense will decline in each succeeding year because it is based on a fixed rate applied
to a declining balance. The rate used was double the straight-line rate, but it could
have been any other rate that the company’s managers believed was representative of
the way the actual equipment depreciation occurred. Notice that the double-declining
balance method also results in an incomplete depreciation of the machine at the end
of 10 years; a balance of USD107,374 (= USD1,000,000 − USD892,626) remains at
the end of the expected life, which will result in a loss upon the retirement of the
equipment if the company’s expectation of zero salvage value turns out to be correct.
Some companies may choose to depreciate the equipment to its expected salvage
value, zero in this case, in its final year of use. Some companies may use a policy of
switching to straight-line depreciation after the midlife of its depreciable assets in
order to fully depreciate them. That particular pattern is coincidentally displayed in
the units-of-production example, in which the equipment is used most heavily in the
earliest part of its useful life, and then levels off to much less utilization in the second
half of the expected life.
    Exhibit 20 shows the different expense allocation patterns of the methods over
the same life. Each will affect earnings differently.

The company’s managers could justify any of these methods. Each might fairly represent
the way the equipment will be consumed over its expected economic life, which is a
subjective estimate. The choices of methods and lives can profoundly affect reported
income. These choices are not proven right or wrong until far into the future—but
managers must estimate their effects in the present.
    Exhibit 21 shows the effects of the three different methods on operating profit and
operating profit margins, assuming that the production output of the equipment gen-
erates revenues of USD500,000 each year and USD200,000 of cash operating expenses
are incurred, leaving USD300,000 of operating profit before depreciation expense.

    Exhibit 21 shows the differences among alternative methods, but even more depre-
ciation expense variation is possible by changing estimated lives and assumptions
about salvage value. For instance, change the expected life assumption to 5 years from
10 and add an expectation that the equipment will have a 10 percent salvage value at
the end of its expected life. Exhibit 22 shows the revised depreciation calculations.
Notice that under the double-declining balance method, the depreciation rate is applied
to the gross cost, unlike the other two methods. The straight-line method and the
units-of-production method subtract the salvage value from the cost before depre-
ciation expense is calculated. Also note that the assumption about the usage of the
equipment is revised so that it is depreciated only to its salvage value of USD100,000 by
the end of its estimated life. The total depreciation under each method is USD900,000.

1Declining balance rate of 20% calculated as 10-year life being equivalent to 10% annual depreciation
rate, multiplied by 2 = 20%.
2 Depreciation calculated as $29,600 instead of 40% × $129,600. Rote application of the declining-bal-
ance rate would have resulted in $51,840 of expense, which would have depreciated the asset below
salvage value.

Exhibit 23 shows the different expense allocation patterns of the methods over the
five-year expected life, and assuming a 10 percent salvage value. Although each method
is distinctly different in the timing of the cost allocation over time, the variation is less
pronounced than over the longer life used in the previous example.

                           One of the clearest examples of how choices affect both the balance sheet and income
                           statement can be found in capitalization practices. In classifying a payment made,
                           management must determine whether the payment will benefit only the current
                           period—making it an expense—or whether it will benefit future periods, leading
                           to classification as a cost to be capitalized as an asset. This management judgment
                           embodies an implicit forecast of how the item acquired by the payment will be used,
                           or not used, in the future.
                               That judgment can be biased by the powerful effect a capitalization policy can
                           have on earnings. Every amount capitalized on the balance sheet as a building, an
                           item of inventory, a deferred cost, or any “other asset” is an amount that has not been
                           recognized as an expense in the reporting period.
                               A real-life example can be found in the case of WorldCom Inc., a telecom concern
                           that grew rapidly in the late 1990s. Much of WorldCom’s financial reporting was
                           eventually found to be fraudulent. An important part of the misreporting centered
                           on its treatment of what is known in the telecom industry as “line costs.” These are
                           the costs of carrying a voice call or data transmission from its starting point to its
                           ending point, and they represented WorldCom’s largest expense. WorldCom’s CFO
                           decided to capitalize such costs instead of treating them as an operating expense. As
                           a consequence, from the second quarter of 1999 through the first quarter of 2002,
                           WorldCom increased its operating income by USD7 billion. In three of the five quar-
                           ters in which the improper line cost capitalization took place, WorldCom would have
                           recognized pre-tax losses instead of profits.25
                               Similarly, acquisitions are an area in which managers must exercise judgment. An
                           allocation of the purchase price must be made to all of the different assets acquired
                           based on their fair values, and those fair values are not always objectively verifiable.
                           Management may have to make its own estimate of fair values for assets acquired,
                           and it may be biased toward a low estimate for the values of depreciable assets in
                           order to depress future depreciation expense. Another benefit to keeping depreciable
                           asset values low is that the amount of the purchase price that cannot be allocated to
                           specific assets is classified as goodwill, which is neither depreciated nor amortized
                           in future reporting periods.

Accounting Choices That Affect the Cash Flow Statement                                                         365


    Goodwill reporting has choices of its own. Although goodwill has no effect on
future earnings when unimpaired, annual testing of its fair value may reveal that the
excess of price paid over the fair value of assets may not be recoverable, which should
lead to a write-down of goodwill. The estimation process for the fair value of goodwill
may depend heavily on projections of future performance. Those projections may be
biased upward to avoid a goodwill write-down.




ACCOUNTING CHOICES THAT AFFECT THE CASH
FLOW STATEMENT                                                                                            11
                describe accounting methods (choices and estimates) that could be
                used to manage earnings, cash flow, and balance sheet items

The cash flow statement consists of three sections: the operating section, which shows
the cash generated or used by operations; the investing section, which shows cash
used for investments or provided by their disposal; and the financing section, which
shows transactions attributable to financing activities.
     The operating section is closely scrutinized by investors. Many of them consider
it a reality check on reported earnings, on the grounds that earnings attributable to
accrual accounting only and unsupported by actual cash flows may indicate earnings
manipulation. Such investors believe that amounts shown for cash generated by oper-
ations is more insulated from managerial manipulation than the income statement.
Cash generated by operations can be managed to an extent, however.
     The operating section of the cash flow statement can be shown either under
the direct method or the indirect method. Under the direct method, “entities are
encouraged to report major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments
and their arithmetic sum—the net cash flow from operating activities.”26 In practice,
companies rarely use the direct method. Instead, they use the indirect method, which
shows a reconciliation of net income to cash provided by operations. The reconcili-
ation shows the non-cash items affecting net income along with changes in working
capital accounts affecting cash from operations. Exhibit 24 provides an example of
the indirect presentation method.

                           Whether the indirect method or direct method is used, simple choices exist for man-
                           agers to improve the appearance of cash flow provided by operations without actually
                           improving it. One such choice is in the area of accounts payable management, shaded
                           in Exhibit 24. Assume that the accounts payable balance is USD5,200 million at the
                           end of the period, an increase of USD1,200 million from its previous year-end balance
                           of USD4,000 million. The USD1,200 million increase in accounts payable matched
                           increased expenses or assets but did not require cash. If the company’s managers had
                           further delayed paying creditors USD500 million until the day after the balance sheet
                           date, they could have increased the cash provided by operating activities by USD500
                           million. If the managers believe that cash generated from operations is a metric of
                           focus for investors, they can impress them with artificially strong cash flow by simply
                           stretching the accounts payable credit period.
                                What might alert investors to such machinations? They need to examine the
                           composition of the operations section of the cash flow statement—if they do not,
                           then nothing will ever alert them. Studying changes in the working capital can reveal
                           unusual patterns that may indicate manipulation of the cash provided by operations.
                                Another practice that might lead an investor to question the quality of cash provided
                           by operations is to compare a company’s cash generation with an industry-wide level
                           or with the cash operating performance of one or more similar competitors. Cash
                           generation performance can be measured several ways. One way is to compare the
                           relationship between cash generated by operations and net income. Cash generated
                           by operations in excess of net income signifies better quality of earnings, whereas a
                           chronic excess of net income over cash generated by operations should be a cause for
                           concern; it may signal the use of accounting methods to simply raise net income instead
                           of depicting financial reality. Another way to measure cash generation performance is
                           to compare cash generated by operations with debt service, capital expenditures, and
                           dividends (if any). When there is a wide variance between the company’s cash gener-
                           ation performance and that of its benchmarks, investors should seek an explanation
                           and carefully examine the changes in working capital accounts.
                                Because investors may focus on cash from operations as an important metric,
                           managers may resort to managing the working capital accounts as described in order
                           to present the most favorable picture. But this can be done in other ways. A company
                           may misclassify operating uses of cash into either the investing or financing sections
                           of the cash flow statement, which enhances the appearance of cash generated by
                           operating activities.
                                Dynegy Inc. provides an example of manipulation of cash from operations through
                           clever construction of contracts and assistance from an unconsolidated special
                           purpose entity named ABG Gas Supply LLC (ABG). In April 2001, Dynegy entered
                           into a contract for the purchase of natural gas from ABG. According to the contract,
                           Dynegy would purchase gas at below-market rates from ABG for nine months and
                           sell it at the current market rate. The nine-month term coincided with Dynegy’s 2001

year-end and would result in gains backed by cash flows. Dynegy also agreed to buy
gas at above-market rates from ABG for the following 51 months and sell it at the
current market rate. The contract was reported at its fair value at the end of fiscal year
2001. It had no effect on net income for the year. The earlier portion of the contract
resulted in a gain, supported by USD300 million of cash flow, but the latter portion
of the contract resulted in non-cash losses that offset the profit. The mark-to-market
rules required the recognition of both gains and losses from all parts of the contract,
and hence the net effect on earnings was zero.
    In April 2002, a Wall Street Journal article exposed the chicanery, thanks to
leaked documents. The SEC required Dynegy to restate the cash flow statement by
reclassifying USD300 million from the operating section of the cash flow statement
to the financing section, on the grounds that Dynegy had used ABG as a conduit to
effectively borrow USD300 million from Citigroup. The bank had extended credit to
ABG, which it used to finance its losses on the contract (Lee, 2012).
    Another area of flexibility in cash flow reporting is found in the area of interest
capitalization, which creates differences between total interest payments and total
interest costs.27 Assume a company incurs total interest cost of USD30,000, composed
of USD3,000 of discount amortization and USD27,000 of interest payments. Of the
USD30,000, two-thirds of it (USD20,000) is expensed; the remaining third (USD10,000)
is capitalized as plant assets. If the company uses the same interest expense/capital-
ization proportions to allocate the interest payments between operating and investing
activities, then it will report USD18,000 (2/3 × USD27,000) as an operating outflow
and USD9,000 (1/3 × USD27,000) as an investing outflow. The company might also
choose to offset the entire USD3,000 of non-cash discount amortization against the
USD20,000 treated as expense, resulting in an operating outflow as low as USD17,000,
or as much as USD20,000 if it allocated all of the non-cash discount amortization to
interest capitalized as investing activities. Similarly, the investing outflow could be
as much as USD10,000 or as little as USD7,000, depending on the treatment of the
non-cash discount amortization. There are choices within the choices, all in areas in
which investors believe choices do not even exist. Nurnberg and Largay (1998) have
noted that companies apparently favor the method that reports the lowest operating
outflow, presumably to maximize reported cash from operations.
    Investors and analysts need to be aware that presentation choices permitted in
IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows, offer flexibility in classification of certain items in the
cash flow statement. This flexibility can drastically change the results in the operating
section of the cash flow statement. An excerpt from IAS 7, Paragraphs 33 and 34,
provides the background:
        33. Interest paid and interest and dividends received are usually classified as
        operating cash flows for a financial institution. However, there is no consen-
        sus on the classification of these cash flows for other entities. Interest paid
        and interest and dividends received may be classified as operating cash flows
        because they enter into the determination of profit or loss. Alternatively,
        interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as financ-
        ing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are costs
        of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments.
            34. Dividends paid may be classified as a financing cash flow because
        they are a cost of obtaining financial resources. Alternatively, dividends paid
        may be classified as a component of cash flows from operating activities in
        order to assist users to determine the ability of an entity to pay dividends
        out of operating cash flows. [Emphasis added.]

                                     By allowing a choice of operating or financing for the placement of interest and
                                 dividends received or paid, IAS 7 gives a company’s managers the opportunities to
                                 select the presentation that gives the best-looking picture of operating performance.
                                 An example is Norse Energy Corp. ASA, a Norwegian gas explorer and producer,
                                 which changed its classifications of interest paid and interest received in 2007 (Gordon,
                                 Henry, Jorgensen, and Linthicum, 2017). Interest paid was switched to financing
                                 instead of decreasing cash generated from operations. Norse Energy also switched its
                                 classification of interest received to investing from operating cash flow. The net effect
                                 of these changes was to report positive, rather than negative, operating cash flows
                                 in both 2007 and 2008. With these simple changes, the company could also change
                                 the perception of its operations. The cash flow statement formerly presented the
                                 appearance of a company with operations that used more cash than it generated, and it

  Exhibit 26: Areas in Which Choices and Estimates Affect Financial Reporting

Area of Choice/Estimate      Analyst Concerns

Revenue recognition          ■   How is revenue recognized: upon shipment or upon delivery
                                 of goods?
                             ■   Is the company engaging in “channel stuffing”—the practice
                                 of overloading a distribution channel with more product than
                                 it is normally capable of selling? This can be accomplished by
                                 inducing customers to buy more through unusual discounts,
                                 the threat of near-term price increases, or both—or simply
                                 by shipping goods that were not ordered. These transactions
                                 may be corrected in a subsequent period and may result in
                                 restated results. Are accounts receivable relative to revenues
                                 abnormally high for relative to the company’s history or to its
                                 peers? If so, channel stuffing may have occurred.
                             ■   Is there unusual activity in the allowance for sales returns
                                 relative to past history?
                             ■   Does the company’s days sales outstanding show any collection
                                 issues that might indicate shipment of unneeded or unwanted
                                 goods to customers?
                             ■   Does the company engage in “bill-and-hold” transactions? This
                                 is when a customer purchases goods but requests that they
                                 remain with the seller until a later date. This kind of transaction
                                 makes it possible for a seller to manufacture fictitious sales by
                                 declaring end-of-period inventory as “sold but held,” with a
                                 minimum of effort and phony documentation.
                             ■   Does the company use rebates as part of its marketing
                                 approach? If so, how significantly do the estimates of rebate
                                 fulfillment affect net revenues, and have any unusual breaks
                                 with history occurred?
                             ■   Does the company separate its revenue arrangements into
                                 multiple deliverables of goods or services? This area is one of
                                 great revenue recognition flexibility and also is one that pro-
                                 vides little visibility to investors. They simply cannot examine
                                 a company’s arrangements and decide for themselves whether
                                 or not revenue has been properly allocated to different com-
                                 ponents of a contract. If a company uses multiple deliverable
                                 arrangements with its customers as a routine matter, investors
                                 might be more sensitive to revenue reporting risks. In seeking
                                 a comfort level, they might ask the following questions: Does
                                 the company explain adequately how it determines the different
                                 allocations of deliverables and how revenue is recognized on
                                 each one? Do deferred revenues result? If not, does it seem
                                 reasonable that there are no deferred revenues for this kind
                                 of arrangement? Are there unusual trends in revenues and
                                 receivables, particularly with regard to cash conversion? If an
                                 investor is not satisfied with the answers to these questions,
                                 he or she might be more comfortable with other investment
                                 choices.

Area of Choice/Estimate      Analyst Concerns
Tax asset valuation          ■   Tax assets, if present, must be stated at the value at which
accounts                         management expects to realize them, and an allowance must
                                 be set up to restate tax assets to the level expected to eventually
                                 be converted into cash. Determining the allowance involves
                                 an estimate of future operations and tax payments. Does the
                                 amount of the valuation allowance seem reasonable, overly
                                 optimistic, or overly pessimistic?
                             ■   Are there contradictions between the management commen-
                                 tary and the allowance level, or the tax note and the allowance
                                 level? There cannot be an optimistic management commentary
                                 and a fully reserved tax asset, or vice versa. One of them has
                                 to be wrong.
                             ■   Look for changes in the tax asset valuation account. It may be
                                 100 percent reserved at first, and then “optimism” increases
                                 whenever an earnings boost is needed. Lowering the reserve
                                 decreases tax expense and increases net income.
Goodwill                     ■   Companies must annually assess goodwill balances for impair-
                                 ment on a qualitative basis. If further testing appears necessary,
                                 it is based on estimates of the fair value of the reporting units
                                 (US GAAP issuers), or cash-generating units (IFRS issuers),
                                 associated with goodwill balances. The tests are based on sub-
                                 jective estimates, including future cash flows and the employ-
                                 ment of discount rates.
                             ■   Do the disclosures on goodwill testing suggest that the exercise
                                 was skewed to avoid impairment charges?
Warranty reserves            ■   Have additions to the reserves been reduced, perhaps to make
                                 earnings targets? Examine the trend in the charges of actual
                                 costs against the reserves: Do they support or contradict the
                                 warranty provisioning activity? Do the actual costs charged
                                 against the reserve give the analyst any indication about the
                                 quality of the products sold?
Related-party transactions   ■   Is the company engaged in transactions that disproportion-
                                 ately benefit members of management? Does one company
                                 have control over another’s destiny through supply contracts
                                 or other dealings?
                             ■   Do extensive dealings take place with non-public companies
                                 that are under management control? If so, those companies
                                 could absorb losses (e.g., through supply arrangements that
                                 are unfavorable to them) to make the public company’s per-
                                 formance look good. This scenario may provide opportunities
                                 for an owner to cash out.

The most important lesson is that choices exist among accounting methods and

whether management may have made choices to achieve a desired result.

            13             WARNING SIGNS

                                        describe accounting warning signs and methods for detecting
                                        manipulation of information in financial reports

                           The choices management makes to achieve desired results leave a trail, like tracks in
                           sand or snow. The evidence, or warning signs, of information manipulation in financial
                           reports is directly linked to the basic means of manipulation: biased revenue recog-
                           nition and biased expense recognition. The bias may relate to timing or location of
                           recognition. An example of the timing issue is that a company may choose to defer
                           expenses by capitalizing them. Regarding location, it may recognize a loss in other
                           comprehensive income or directly through equity, rather than through the profit and
                           loss statement. The alert investor or analyst should do the following to identify the
                           warning signs.


                           Pay Attention to Revenue
                           The single largest number on the income statement is revenue, and revenue recognition
                           is a recurring source of accounting manipulation and even outright fraud. Answering
                           the question, “Is revenue higher or lower than the previous comparable period?” is
                           not sufficient. Many analytical procedures can be routinely performed to identify
                           warning signals of malfeasance:
                              ■   Examine the accounting policies note for a company’s revenue recognition
                                  policies.
                              ■   Consider whether the policies make it easier to prematurely recognize reve-
                                  nue, such as recognizing revenue immediately upon shipment of goods, or if
                                  the company uses bill-and-hold arrangements whereby a sale is recognized
                                  before goods actually are shipped to the customer.
                              ■   Barter transactions may exist, which can be difficult to value properly.
                              ■   Rebate programs involve many estimates, including forecasts of the amount
                                  of rebates that ultimately will be incurred, which can have significant effects
                                  on revenue recognition.
                              ■   Multiple-deliverable arrangements of goods and services are common, but
                                  clarity about the timing of revenue recognition for each item or service
                                  delivered is necessary for the investor to be comfortable with the reporting
                                  of revenues.
                               Although none of these decisions necessarily violates accounting standards, each
                           involves significant judgement and warrants close attention if other warning signs
                           are present.
                              ■   Look at revenue relationships. Compare a company’s revenue growth with its
                                  primary competitors or its industry peer group.
                              ■   If a company’s revenue growth is out of line with its competitors, its indus-
                                  try, or the economy, the investor or analyst needs to understand the reasons
                                  for the outperformance. It may be a result of superior management or prod-
                                  ucts and services, but not all management is superior, nor are the products
                                  and services of their companies. Revenue quality might be suspect, and the
                                  investor should take additional analytical steps.
                              ■   Compare accounts receivable with revenues over several years.
Warning Signs                                                                              373


       ●   Examine the trend to determine whether receivables are increasing
           as a percentage of total revenues. If so, a company might be engag-
           ing in channel-stuffing activities, or worse, recording fictitious sales
           transactions.
       ●   Calculate receivables turnover for several years:
   ■   Examine the trend for unusual changes and seek an explanation if they exist.
   ■   Compare a company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) or receivables turnover
       with that of relevant competitors or an industry peer group and determine
       whether the company is an outlier.
   An increase in DSO or decrease in receivables turnover could suggest that some
revenues are recorded prematurely or are even fictitious, or that the allowance for
doubtful accounts is insufficient.
   ■   Examine asset turnover. If a company’s managers make poor asset alloca-
       tion choices, revenues may not be sufficient to justify the investment. Be
       particularly alert when asset allocation choices involve acquisitions of entire
       companies. If post-acquisition revenue generation is weak, managers might
       reach for revenue growth anywhere it can be found. That reach for growth
       might result in accounting abuses.
   Revenues, divided by total assets, indicate the productivity of assets in generating
revenues. If the company’s asset turnover is continually declining, or lagging the asset
turnover of competitors or the industry, it may portend future asset write-downs,
particularly in the goodwill balances of acquisitive companies.


Pay Attention to Signals from Inventories
Although inventory is not a component of every company’s asset base, its presence
creates an opportunity for accounting manipulation.
   ■   Look at inventory relationships. Because revenues involve items sold from
       inventory, the kind of examination an investor should perform on inventory
       is similar to that for revenues.
   ■   Compare growth in inventories with competitors and industry benchmarks.
       If a company’s inventory growth is out of line with its peers, without any
       concurrent sales growth, then it simply may be the result of poor inventory
       management—an operational inefficiency that might affect an investor’s
       view of a company. It also may signal obsolescence problems in the com-
       pany’s inventory that have not yet been recognized through markdowns to
       the inventory’s net realizable value. Reported gross and net profits could be
       overstated because of overstated inventory.
   ■   Calculate the inventory turnover ratio. This ratio is the cost of sales divided
       by the average ending inventory. Declining inventory turnover could also
       suggest obsolescence problems that should be recognized.
   ■   Companies reporting under US GAAP may use LIFO inventory cost flow
       assumptions. When this assumption is part of the accounting policies, and
       a company operates in an inflationary environment, investors should note
       whether old, low-cost inventory costs have been passed through current
       earnings and artificially improved gross, operating, and net profits.

                           Pay Attention to Capitalization Policies and Deferred Costs
                           In a study of enforcement actions over a five-year period, the SEC found that improper
                           revenue recognition was the most prevalent accounting issue.28 Suppression of expenses
                           was the next most prevalent problem noted. As the earlier discussion of WorldCom
                           showed, improper capitalization practices can result in a significant misstatement of
                           financial results.
                               ■   Examine the company’s accounting policy note for its capitalization policy
                                   for long-term assets, including interest costs, and for its handling of other
                                   deferred costs. Compare the company’s policy with the industry practice. If
                                   the company is the only one capitalizing certain costs while other industry
                                   participants treat them as expenses, a red flag is raised. If an outlier com-
                                   pany of this type is encountered, it would be useful to cross-check such a
                                   company’s asset turnover and profitability margins with others in its indus-
                                   try. An investor might expect such a company to be more profitable than
                                   its competitors, but the investor might also have lower confidence in the
                                   quality of the reported numbers.



                           Pay Attention to the Relationship between Cash Flow and Net
                           Income
                           Net income propels stock prices, but cash flow pays bills. Management can manipulate
                           either one, but sooner or later, net income must be realized in cash if a company is
                           to remain viable. When net income is higher than cash provided by operations, one
                           possibility is that aggressive accrual accounting policies have shifted current expenses
                           to later periods. Increasing earnings in the presence of declining cash generated by
                           operations might signal accounting irregularities.
                               ■   Construct a time series of cash generated by operations divided by net
                                   income. If the ratio is consistently below 1.0 or has declined repeatedly, the
                                   company’s accrual accounts may have problems.



                           Look for Other Potential Warnings Signs
                           Other areas that might suggest the need for further analysis include the following:
                               ■   Depreciation methods and useful lives. As discussed earlier, selection of
                                   depreciation methods and useful lives can greatly influence profitability.
                                   An investor should compare a company’s policies with those of its peers
                                   to determine whether it is particularly lenient in its effects on earnings.
                                   Investors should likewise compare the length of depreciable lives used by a
                                   company with those used by its peers.
                               ■   Fourth-quarter surprises. An investor should be suspicious of possible earn-
                                   ings management if a company routinely disappoints investors with poor
                                   earnings or overachieves in the fourth quarter of the year when no season-
                                   ality exists in the business. The company may be over- or under-reporting
                                   profits in the first three quarters of the year.
                               ■   Presence of related-party transactions. Related-party transactions often arise
                                   when a company’s founders are still very active in managing the company,
                                   with much of their wealth tied to the company’s fortunes. They may be more

Warning Signs                                                                               375


       biased in their view of a company’s performance because it relates directly
       to their own wealth and reputations, and they may be able to transact
       business with the company in ways that may not be detected. For instance,
       they may purchase unsellable inventory from the company for disposal in
       another company of their own to avoid markdowns.
   ■   Non-operating income or one-time sales included in revenue. To disguise
       weakening revenue growth, or just to enhance revenue growth, a company
       might classify non-operating income items into revenues or fail to clarify
       the nature of revenues. In the first quarter of 1997, Sunbeam Corporation
       included one-time disposal of product lines in sales without indicating that
       such non-recurring sales were included in revenues. This inclusion gave
       investors a false impression of the company’s sustainable revenue-generating
       capability.
   ■   Classification of expenses as “non-recurring.” To make operating perfor-
       mance look more attractive, managers might carve out “special items” in the
       income statement. Particularly when these items appear period after period,
       equity investors might find their interests best served by not accepting the
       carve-out of serial “special items” and instead focusing on the net income
       line in evaluating performance over long periods.
   ■   Gross/operating margins out of line with competitors or industry. This dis-
       parity is an ambivalent warning sign. It might signal superior management
       ability. But it might also signal the presence of accounting manipulations to
       add a veneer of superior management ability to the company’s reputation.
       Only the compilation and examination of other warning signals will enable
       an investor or analyst to decide which signal is being given.
    Warning signals are just that: signals, not indisputable declarations of accounting
manipulation guilt. Investors and analysts need to evaluate them cohesively, not on an
isolated basis. When an investor finds a number of these signals, the investee company
should be viewed with caution or even discarded in favor of alternatives.
    Furthermore, as discussed earlier, context is important in judging the value of warn-
ing signals. A few examples of facts and circumstances to be aware of are as follows.
   ■   Younger companies with an unblemished record of meeting growth projec-
       tions. It is plausible, especially for a younger company with new and popular
       product offerings, to generate above-average returns for a period of time.
       But, as demand dissipates, products mature, and competitors challenge for
       market share, management may seek to extend its recent record of rapid
       growth in sales and profitability by unconventional means. At this point,
       the “earnings games” begin, including aggressive estimates, drawing down
       “cookie jar” reserves, selling assets for accounting gains, taking on excess
       leverage, or entering into financial transactions with no apparent business
       purpose other than financial statement “window dressing.”
   ■   Management has adopted a minimalist approach to disclosure. Confidence
       in accounting quality depends on disclosure. If management does not seem
       to take seriously its obligation to provide information, one needs to be
       concerned. For example, for a large company, management might claim
       that it has only one reportable segment, or its commentary might be similar
       from period to period. A plausible explanation for minimalist disclosure
       policies could be that management is protecting investors’ interests by
       withholding valuable information from competitors. But, this is not neces-
       sarily the case. For example, after Sony Corporation acquired CBS Records
       and Columbia Pictures, it incurred substantial losses for a number of years.
       Yet, Sony chose to hide its negative trends and doubtful future prospects by

                                   aggregating the results within a much larger “Entertainment Division.” In
                                   1998, after Sony ultimately wrote off much of the goodwill associated with
                                   these ill-fated acquisitions, the SEC sanctioned Sony and its CFO for failing
                                   to separately discuss them in the MD&A in a balanced manner.29
                               ■   Management fixation on earnings reports. Beware of companies whose man-
                                   agement appears to be fixated on reported earnings, sometimes to the det-
                                   riment of attending to real drivers of value. Indicators of excessive earnings
                                   fixation include the aggressive use of non-GAAP measures of performance,
                                   special items, or non-recurring charges. Another indicator of earnings fix-
                                   ation is highly decentralized operations in which division managers’ com-
                                   pensation packages are heavily weighted toward the attainment of reported
                                   earnings or non-GAAP measures of performance.


                           Company Culture
                           A company’s culture is an intangible that investors should bear in mind when they
                           are evaluating financial statements for the possibility of accounting manipulation.
                           A management’s highly competitive mentality may serve investors well when the
                           company conducts business (assuming that actions taken are not unethical, illegal, or
                           harmfully myopic), but that kind of thinking should not extend to communications
                           with the owners of the company: the shareholders. That mentality can lead to the
                           kind of accounting gamesmanship seen in the early part of the century. In examining
                           financial statements for warning signs of manipulation, the investor should consider
                           whether that mindset exists in the preparation of the financial statements.
                               One notable example of this mindset comes from one of the most recognized
                           corporate names in the world, General Electric. In the mid-1980s, GE acquired Kidder
                           Peabody, and it was ultimately determined that much of the earnings that Kidder had
                           reported were bogus. As a consequence, GE announced within two days of the acqui-
                           sition that it would take a non-cash write-off of USD350 million. Here is how former
                           CEO/Chair Jack Welsh described the ensuing meeting with senior management in
                           his memoir, Straight from the Gut:
                                   The response of our business leaders to the crisis was typical of the GE
                                   culture [emphasis added]. Even though the books had closed on the quarter,
                                   many immediately offered to pitch in to cover the Kidder gap. Some said
                                   they could find an extra USD10 million, USD20 million, and even USD30
                                   million from their businesses to offset the surprise. Though it was too late,
                                   their willingness to help was a dramatic contrast to the excuses I had been
                                   hearing from the Kidder people. (page 225)
                               It appears that the corporate governance apparatus fostered a GE culture that
                           extended the concept of teamwork to the point of “sharing” profits to win one for the
                           team as a whole, which is incompatible with the concept of neutral financial reporting.
                           Although research is not conclusive on this question, it may be worth considering that
                           predisposition to earnings manipulation is more likely to be present when the CEO
                           and board chair positions are held by the same person, or when the audit committee
                           of the board essentially serves at the pleasure of the CEO and lacks financial reporting
                           sophistication. Finally, one could discuss whether the financial reporting environment
                           today would reward or penalize a CEO who openly endorsed a view that he or she
                           could legitimately exercise financial reporting discretion—albeit within limits—for
                           the purpose of artificially smoothing earnings.

Restructuring or Impairment Charges
At times, a company’s stock price has been observed to rise after it recognized a big
bath charge to reported earnings. The conventional wisdom explaining the stock price
rise is that accounting recognition signals something positive: that management is
now ready to part with the lagging portion of a company, so as to redirect its attention
and talents to more profitable activities. Consequently, the earnings charge should be
disregarded for being solely related to past events.
    The analyst should also consider, however, that the events leading ultimately to
the big bath on the financial statements did not happen overnight, even though the
accounting for those events occurs at a subsequent point. Management may want to
communicate that the accounting adjustments reflect the company’s new path, but
the restructuring charge also indicates that the old path of reported earnings was not
real. In particular, expenses reported in prior years were very likely understated—
even assuming that no improper financial statement manipulation had occurred. To
extrapolate historical earnings trends, an analyst should consider making pro forma
analytical adjustments to prior years’ earnings to reflect a reasonable division of the
latest period’s restructuring and impairment charges.

Management Has a Merger and Acquisition Orientation
Tyco International Ltd. acquired more than 700 companies from 1996 to 2002. Even
assuming the best of intentions regarding financial reporting, a growth-at-any-cost
corporate culture poses a severe challenge to operational and financial reporting
controls. In Tyco’s case, the SEC found that it consistently and fraudulently under-
stated assets acquired (lowering future depreciation and amortization charges) and
overstated liabilities assumed (avoiding expense recognition and potentially increasing
earnings in future periods).30

                           8. When earnings are increased by deferring research and development (R&D)
                              investments until the next reporting period, this choice is considered:

                           11. Conservative accounting choices will most likely lead to:
                              A. decreased reported earnings in later periods.

                              B. increased reported earnings in the period under review.

                              C. increased debt reported on the balance sheet at the end of the current
                                 period.

   SOLUTIONS
1. B is correct. Financial reporting quality pertains to the quality of information
   in financial reports. High-quality financial reporting provides decision-useful
   information, which is relevant and faithfully represents the economic reality of
   the company’s activities. Earnings of high quality are sustainable and provide an
   adequate level of return. Highest-quality financial reports reflect both high finan-
   cial reporting quality and high earnings quality.

2. C is correct. Financial reporting quality pertains to the quality of the infor-
   mation contained in financial reports. High-quality financial reports provide
   decision-useful information that faithfully represents the economic reality of the
   company. Low-quality financial reports impede assessment of earnings qual-
   ity. Financial reporting quality is distinguishable from earnings quality, which
   pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic
   activities and the resulting financial condition. Low-quality earnings are not sus-
   tainable and decrease company value.

3. B is correct. Financial reporting quality pertains to the quality of the information
   contained in financial reports. If financial reporting quality is low, the informa-
   tion provided is of little use in assessing the company’s performance. Financial
   reporting quality is distinguishable from earnings quality, which pertains to the
   earnings and cash generated by the company’s actual economic activities and the
   resulting financial condition.

4. B is correct. Earnings quality pertains to the earnings and cash generated by
   the company’s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition.
   Low-quality earnings are likely not sustainable over time because the company
   does not expect to generate the same level of earnings in the future or because
   earnings will not generate sufficient return on investment to sustain the compa-
   ny. Earnings that are not sustainable decrease company value. Earnings quality is
   distinguishable from financial reporting quality, which pertains to the quality of
   the information contained in financial reports.

5. A is correct. Earnings that result from non-recurring activities are unsustainable.
   Unsustainable earnings are an example of lower-quality earnings. Recognizing
   earnings that result from non-recurring activities is neither a biased accounting
   choice nor indicative of lower quality financial reporting because it faithfully
   represents economic events.

6. B is correct. At the top of the quality spectrum of financial reports are reports
   that conform to GAAP, are decision useful, and have earnings that are sustainable
   and offer adequate returns. In other words, these reports have both high financial
   reporting quality and high earnings quality.

7. Solution:
   A is correct. Financial reports span a quality continuum from high to low based
   on decision-usefulness and earnings quality (see Exhibit 2). The lowest-quality
   reports portray fictitious events, which may misrepresent the company’s perfor-
   mance or obscure fraudulent misappropriation of the company’s assets.

8. Solution:
   B is correct. Deferring R&D investments into the next reporting period is an
   example of earnings management by taking a real action.

                           9. B is correct. High-quality financial reports offer useful information, meaning in-
                              formation that is relevant and faithfully represents actual performance. Although
                              low earnings quality may not be desirable, if the reported earnings are repre-
                              sentative of actual performance, they are consistent with high-quality financial
                              reporting. Highest-quality financial reports reflect both high financial reporting
                              quality and high earnings quality.

                           10. B is correct. Aggressive accounting choices aim to enhance the company’s report-
                               ed performance by inflating the amount of revenues, earnings, or operating cash
                               flow reported in the period. Consequently, the financial performance for that
                               period would most likely exhibit an upward bias.

                           11. C is correct. Accounting choices are considered conservative if they decrease the
                               company’s reported performance and financial position in the current period
                               under review. Conservative choices may increase the amount of debt reported on
                               the balance sheet. They may decrease the revenues, earnings, or operating cash
                               flow reported for the period and increase those amounts in later periods.

                           12. A is correct. Conservatism reduces the possibility of litigation and, by extension,
                               litigation costs. Rarely, if ever, is a company sued because it understated good
                               news or overstated bad news. Accounting conservatism is a type of bias in finan-
                               cial reporting that decreases a company’s reported performance. Conservatism
                               directly conflicts with the characteristic of neutrality.

                           13. B is correct. Managers often have incentives to meet or beat market expectations,
                               particularly if management compensation is linked to increases in share prices or
                               to reported earnings.

                           14. C is correct. Managers may be motivated to understate earnings in a period with
                               unexpected strong performance by delaying revenue recognition or accelerating
                               expense recognition to increase the probability of exceeding expectations in a
                               subsequent period (referred to as “banking” some earnings for the next period.)

                           15. C is correct. Typically, conditions of opportunity, motivation, and rationalization
                               exist when individuals issue low-quality financial reports. Rationalization occurs
                               when an individual is concerned about a choice and needs to be able to justify
                               it to herself or himself. If the manager is concerned about a choice in a financial
                               report, the manager may ask for other opinions to convince herself or himself
                               that it is okay.

                           16. C is correct. In a period of strong financial performance, managers may pursue
                               accounting choices that increase the probability of exceeding earnings forecasts
                               for the next period. By accelerating expense recognition or delaying revenue
                               recognition, managers may reduce financial performance in the current period in
                               order to inflate earnings in the next period and increase the likelihood of exceed-
                               ing targets.

                           17. B is correct. Motivation can result from pressure to meet some criteria for
                               personal reasons, such as a bonus, or corporate reasons, such as concern about
                               future financing. Poor internal controls and an inattentive board of directors offer
                               opportunities to issue low-quality financial reports.

                           18. A is correct. The possibility of bond covenant violations may motivate managers
                               to inflate earnings in the reporting period. In so doing, the company may be able
                               to avoid the consequences associated with violating bond covenants.

                           19. A is correct. Opportunities to issue low-quality financial reports include internal
Solutions                                                                                  385


   conditions, such as an ineffective board of directors, and external conditions,
   such as accounting standards that provide scope for divergent choices. Pressure
   to achieve a certain level of performance and corporate concerns about future
   financing are examples of motivations to issue low-quality financial reports.
   Typically, three conditions exist when low-quality financial reports are issued:
   opportunity, motivation, and rationalization.

20. C is correct. An audit is intended to provide assurance that the company’s finan-
    cial reports are presented fairly, thus providing discipline regarding financial re-
    porting quality. Regulatory agencies usually require that the financial statements
    of publicly traded companies be audited by an independent auditor to provide
    assurance that the financial statements conform to accounting standards. Private-
    ly held companies may also choose to obtain audit opinions either voluntarily or
    because an outside party requires it. An audit is not typically intended to detect
    fraud. An audit is based on sampling and it is possible that the sample might not
    reveal misstatements.

21. B is correct. If a company uses a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, it
    is required to provide the most directly comparable GAAP measure with equiv-
    alent prominence in the filing. In addition, the company is required to provide a
    reconciliation between the non-GAAP measure and the equivalent GAAP mea-
    sure. Similarly, IFRS requires that any non-IFRS measures included in financial
    reports must be defined and their potential relevance explained. The non-IFRS
    measures must be reconciled with IFRS measures.

22. B is correct. If a company wants to increase reported earnings, the company’s
    managers may reduce the allowance for uncollected accounts and the related
    expense reported for the period. Decreasing the useful life of depreciable assets
    would increase depreciation expense and decrease earnings in the reporting pe-
    riod. Classifying a purchase as an expense, rather than capital expenditure, would
    decrease earnings in the reporting period. The use of accrual accounting may
    result in estimates in financial reports, because all facts associated with events
    may not be known at the time of recognition. These estimates can be grounded in
    reality or managed by the company to present a desired financial picture.

23. A is correct. Managers can temporarily show a higher cash flow from operations
    by stretching the accounts payable credit period. In other words, the managers
    delay payments until the next accounting period. Applying all non-cash discount
    amortization against interest capitalized causes reported interest expenses and
    operating cash outflow to be higher, resulting in a lower cash flow provided by
    operations. Shifting the classification of interest paid from financing to operating
    cash flows lowers the cash flow provided by operations.

24. B is correct. Bias in revenue recognition can lead to manipulation of information
    presented in financial reports. Addressing the question as to whether revenue is
    higher or lower than the previous period is insufficient to determine if there is
    bias in revenue recognition. Additional analytical procedures must be performed
    to identify warning signals of accounting malfeasance. Barter transactions are
    difficult to value properly and may result in bias in revenue recognition. Policies
    that make it easier to prematurely recognize revenue, such as before goods are
    shipped to customers, may be a warning sign of accounting malfeasance.

25. C is correct. If a company’s days sales outstanding (DSO) is increasing relative to
    competitors, this may be a signal that revenues are being recorded prematurely or
    are even fictitious. Numerous analytical procedures can be performed to provide
    evidence of manipulation of information in financial reporting. These warning
    signs are often linked to bias associated with revenue recognition and expense

                              recognition policies.

                           26. B is correct. If the ratio of cash flow to net income for a company is consistently
                               below 1 or has declined repeatedly over time, this may be a signal of manipula-
                               tion of information in financial reports through aggressive accrual accounting
                               policies. When net income is consistently higher than cash provided by oper-
                               ations, one possible explanation is that the company may be using aggressive
                               accrual accounting policies to shift current expenses to later periods.

                           27. C is correct. To extrapolate historical earnings trends, an analyst should con-
                               sider making pro forma analytical adjustments of prior years’ earnings to reflect
                               in those prior years a reasonable share of the current period’s restructuring and
                               impairment charges.

              1            INTRODUCTION
                           Analysts convert financial statement and other data into metrics that assist in decision
                           making and help answer questions such as the following: How successfully has a target
                           company performed, relative to its own past performance and relative to its competi-
                           tors? How is the company likely to perform in the future? Based on expectations about
                           future performance, what is the value of this company or the securities it issues? This
                           module describes various techniques used to answer these and other questions. These
                           financial analysis techniques are crucial to a wide range of analytical tasks, including
                           valuing equity securities, assessing credit risk, conducting due diligence related to an
                           acquisition, and evaluating business performance.

                              LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                                 ■   There is no single approach to structuring the financial analysis
                                     process, but a general framework entails the following phases:
                                     articulate the purpose of the analysis, collect input data, process the
                                     data, analyze and interpret the processed data, develop and com-
                                     municate conclusions and recommendations, follow-up periodically
                                     to determine if any changes are necessary to recommendations or
                                     holdings.
                                 ■   The purpose of analysis is not simply to compile information and
                                     do computations, but to integrate these into a cohesive result that
                                     addresses not just what happened, but why it happened and whether it
                                     created value. An analyst must be able to understand the “why” behind
                                     the numbers and ratios, not just what the numbers and ratios are.
                                 ■   Evaluations require comparisons. It is difficult to say that a company’s
                                     financial performance was “good” or “bad” without clarifying the basis
                                     for comparison. Cross-sectional analysis compares multiple companies
                                     at the same point in time or over the same range of time, and trend or
                                     time-series analysis compares measures for a single company over a
                                     period of time.
                                 ■   Ratios and common-size financial statements can remove size as a
                                     factor and enable more relevant comparisons. Financial statement
                                     ratios are helpful for valuing companies and securities, selecting
                                     investments, and predicting financial distress. The ratio is an indicator
                                     of some aspect of a company’s performance, telling what happened but
                                     not why it happened.
                                 ■   Common-size analysis involves expressing financial data, including
                                     entire financial statements, in relation to a single financial statement
                                     item, or base. A vertical common-size balance sheet divides each
                                     balance sheet item by the same period’s total assets and expresses
                                     the results as percentages. A vertical common-size income statement
                                     divides each income statement item by revenue or by total assets. A
                                     horizontal common-size balance sheet divides the quantity of each
                                     item by a base year quantity of the same item to yield a percentage
                                     change in that item from the base year. Trend data generated by a
                                     horizontal common-size analysis can be compared across financial
                                     statements.

       ■   Graphs facilitate comparison of performance and financial structure
           over time, provide a visual overview of changes and trends, and can
           be used to communicate the conclusions from financial analysis.
           Regression analysis can help identify relationships or correlation
           between variables.
       ■   Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company’s operations, such
           as a collection of receivables or management of inventory. Major
           activity ratios include inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand,
           receivables turnover, days of sales outstanding, payables turnover,
           number of days of payables, working capital turnover, fixed asset turn-
           over, and total asset turnover.
       ■   Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet short-term
           obligations. Major liquidity ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio,
           cash ratio, and defensive interval ratio. The cash conversion cycle is a
           measure of liquidity that is not a simple ratio.
       ■   Solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to meet long-term
           obligations. Major solvency ratios include debt ratios (including the
           debt-to-assets ratio, debt-to-capital ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and
           financial leverage ratio) and coverage ratios (including interest cover-
           age and fixed charge coverage).
       ■   Profitability ratios measure the ability of a company to generate profits
           from revenue and assets. Major profitability ratios include return on
           sales ratios (including gross profit margin, operating profit margin,
           pretax margin, and net profit margin) and return on investment ratios
           (including operating return on assets [ROA], ROA, return on total
           capital, return on equity [ROE], and return on common equity).
       ■   It is important to examine a variety of financial ratios—not a single
           ratio or category of ratios in isolation—to ascertain the overall posi-
           tion and performance of a company.
       ■   DuPont analysis breaks ROE into components that are indicators of
           different aspects of company performance. Many levels of decomposi-
           tion are possible.
       ■   The five-component DuPont decomposition expresses a company’s
           ROE as a function of its tax rate, interest burden, operating profitabil-
           ity, efficiency, and leverage.
       ■   Because aspects of performance that are considered important in one
           industry may be irrelevant in another, industry-specific ratios are used
           that reflect these differences.
       ■   Techniques such as sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and simula-
           tion are used to forecast future financial performance.




THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PROCESS

                                    In financial analysis, it is essential to clearly identify and understand the final objective
                                    and the steps required to reach that objective. In addition, the analyst needs to know
                                    where to find relevant data, how to process and analyze the data (in other words, know
                                    the typical questions to address when interpreting data), and how to communicate
                                    the analysis and conclusions.


                                    The Objectives of the Financial Analysis Process
                                    Because of the variety of reasons for performing financial analysis, the numerous
                                    available techniques, and the often substantial amount of data, it is important that
                                    the analytical approach be tailored to the specific situation. Prior to beginning any
                                    financial analysis, the analyst should clarify the purpose and context, and clearly
                                    understand the following:
                                           ■   What is the purpose of the analysis? What questions will this analysis
                                               answer?
                                           ■   What level of detail will be needed to accomplish this purpose?
                                           ■   What data are available for the analysis?
                                           ■   What are the factors or relationships that will influence the analysis?
                                           ■   What are the analytical limitations, and will these limitations potentially
                                               impair the analysis?
                                        Having clarified the purpose and context of the analysis, the analyst can select
                                    the set of techniques (e.g., ratios) that will best assist in making a decision. Although
                                    there is no single approach to structuring the analysis process, a general framework
                                    is set forth in Exhibit 1. The steps in this process were discussed in more detail in
                                    an earlier module; the primary focus of this module is on Phases 3 and 4, processing
                                    and analyzing data.

Distinguishing between Computations and Analysis
An effective analysis encompasses both computations and interpretations. A
well-reasoned analysis differs from a mere compilation of various pieces of infor-
mation, computations, tables, and graphs by integrating the data collected into a
cohesive whole. Analysis of past performance, for example, should address not only
what happened but also why it happened and whether it created value. Some of the
key questions to address include the following:
     ■   What aspects of performance are critical for this company to successfully
         compete in this industry?
     ■   How well did the company’s performance meet these critical aspects?
         (Established through computation and comparison with appropriate bench-
         marks, such as the company’s own historical performance or competitors’
         performance.)
     ■   What were the key causes of this performance, and how does this perfor-
         mance reflect the company’s strategy? (Established through analysis.)
     If the analysis is forward looking, additional questions include the following:
     ■   What is the likely impact of an event or trend? (Established through inter-
         pretation of analysis.)
     ■   What is the likely response of management to this trend? (Established
         through evaluation of quality of management and corporate governance.)
     ■   What is the likely impact of trends in the company, industry, and economy
         on future cash flows? (Established through assessment of corporate strategy
         and through forecasts.)
     ■   What are the recommendations of the analyst? (Established through inter-
         pretation and forecasting of results of analysis.)
     ■   What risks should be highlighted? (Established by an evaluation of major
         uncertainties in the forecast and in the environment within which the com-
         pany operates.)

                               Example 1 demonstrates how a company’s financial data can be analyzed in the
                           context of its business strategy and changes in that strategy. An analyst must be able
                           to understand the “why” behind the numbers and ratios, not just what the numbers
                           and ratios are.

                                 Apple reported a 7.7 percent decrease in net sales from FY2015 to FY2016
                             and an increase of 6.3 percent from FY2016 to FY2017 for an overall slight
                             decline over the three-year period. Gross margin decreased 10.0 percent from
                             FY2015 to FY2016 and increased 4.7 percent from FY2016 to FY2017. This also
                             represented an overall decline in gross margin over the three-year period. The

                                 Microsoft reported an 8.8 percent decrease in net sales from FY2015 to

   three-year period. Microsoft’s operating income, in contrast, exhibited growth
   each year and for the three-year period. Overall growth in operating income
   was 23 percent.
       What caused Microsoft’s growth in operating income while Apple and
   Microsoft had similar negative trends in sales and gross margin? Apple’s decline
   in sales, gross margin, and operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 was
   caused by declines in iPhone sales and weakness in foreign currencies relative
   to the US dollar. FY2017 saw a rebound in sales of iPhones, Mac computers,
   and services offset somewhat by continued weaknesses in foreign currencies.
   Microsoft similarly had declines in revenue and gross margin from sales of its
   devices and Windows software in FY2016, as well as negative impacts from
   foreign currency weakness. Microsoft’s increase in revenue and gross margin
   in FY2017 was driven by the acquisition of LinkedIn, higher sales of Microsoft
   Office software, and higher sales of cloud services. The driver in the continuous
   increase in operating income for Microsoft was a large decline over the three-
   year period in impairment, integration, and restructuring charges. Microsoft
   recorded a USD10 billion charge in FY2015 related to its phone business, and
   there were further charges of USD1.1 billion in FY2016 and USD306 million in
   FY2017. Absent these large write-offs, Microsoft would have had a trend similar
   to Apple’s in operating income over the three-year period.

   Analysts often need to communicate the findings of their analysis in a written
report. Their reports should communicate how conclusions were reached and why
recommendations were made. For example, a report might present the following:
    ■   the purpose of the report, unless it is readily apparent;
    ■   relevant aspects of the business context, including:

        ●   economic environment (country/region, macro economy, sector),
        ●   financial and other infrastructure (accounting, auditing, rating agencies),
            and
        ●   legal and regulatory environment (and any other material limitations on
            the company being analyzed);
    ■   evaluation of corporate governance and assessment of management strategy,
        including the company’s competitive advantage(s);
    ■   assessment of financial and operational data, including key assumptions in
        the analysis; and
    ■   conclusions and recommendations, including limitations of the analysis and
        risks.
    An effective narrative and well supported conclusions and recommendations
are normally enhanced by using 3–10 years of data as well as by analytic techniques
appropriate to the purpose of the report.

                           The tools and techniques presented in this lesson facilitate evaluations of company
                           data. Evaluations require comparisons. It is difficult to say that a company’s financial
                           performance was “good” or “bad” without clarifying the basis for comparison. In
                           assessing a company’s ability to generate and grow earnings and cash flow, and the
                           risks related to those earnings and cash flows, the analyst draws comparisons to other
                           companies at the same point in time or over the same range of time (cross-sectional
                           analysis) and over time (trend or time-series analysis).
                                For example, an analyst may wish to compare the profitability of companies
                           competing in a global industry. If the companies differ significantly in size or report
                           their financial data in different currencies, comparing net income as reported is not
                           useful. Ratios (which express one number in relation to another) and common-size
                           financial statements can remove size as a factor and enable a more relevant compar-
                           ison. To achieve comparability across companies reporting in different currencies,
                           one approach is to translate all reported numbers into a common currency using
                           average or period-end exchange rates. Alternatively, if the focus is primarily on ratios,
                           comparability can be achieved without translating the currencies.
                                The analyst may also want to examine comparable performance over time. Again,
                           the nominal currency amounts of sales or net income may not highlight significant
                           changes. To address this challenge, horizontal financial statements (whereby quan-
                           tities are stated in terms of a selected base year value) can make such changes more
                           apparent. Another obstacle to comparison is differences in fiscal year end. To achieve
                           comparability, one approach is to develop trailing 12 months of data. Finally, it should
                           be noted that differences in accounting standards can limit comparability.

                              Ratio Analysis
                              An analyst is examining the profitability of two international companies with
                              large shares of the global personal computer market: Acer Inc. and Lenovo Group
                              Limited. Acer has pursued a strategy of selling its products at affordable prices.
                              In contrast, Lenovo aims to achieve higher selling prices by stressing the high
                              engineering quality of its personal computers for business use. Acer reports in
                              New Taiwan dollars (TWD) and Lenovo reports in US dollars (USD). For Acer,
                              fiscal year end is 31 December. For Lenovo, fiscal year end is 31 March; thus,
                              FY2017 ended 31 March 2018.
                                  The analyst collects the data shown in Exhibit 4. Use this information to

   Note: Fiscal years for Lenovo end 31 March. Thus, FY2017 represents the fiscal year ended 31

   1. Which company is larger based on the amount of revenue, in US dollars,
      reported in fiscal year 2017? For FY2017, assume the relevant, average ex-
      change rate was 30.95 TWD/USD.
      Solution:
      Lenovo is much larger than Acer based on FY2017 revenues in US dollar
      terms. Lenovo’s FY2017 revenues of USD45.35 billion are considerably high-
      er than Acer’s USD7.67 billion (= TWD237.275 million/30.95).
      Acer: At the assumed average exchange rate of 30.95 TWD/USD, Acer’s
      FY2017 revenues are equivalent to USD7.67 billion (= TWD237.275 million
      ÷ 30.95 TWD/USD).
      Lenovo: Lenovo’s FY2017 revenues totaled USD45.35 billion.
      Note: Comparing the size of companies reporting in different currencies
      requires translating reported numbers into a common currency using
      exchange rates at some point in time. This solution converts the revenues
      of Acer to billions of US dollars using the average exchange rate of the fiscal
      period. It would be equally informative (and would yield the same conclu-
      sion) to convert the revenues of Lenovo to New Taiwan dollars.

   2. Which company had the higher revenue growth from FY2016 to FY2017?
      FY2013 to FY2017?
      Solution:
      The growth in Lenovo’s revenue was much higher than Acer’s in the most
      recent fiscal year and for the five-year period.

      The table shows two growth metrics. Calculations are illustrated using the
      revenue data for Acer:

                                 The change in Acer’s revenue for FY2016 versus FY2017 is 1.96 percent cal-
                                 culated as (237,275 – 232,724) ÷ 232,724 or equivalently (237,275 ÷ 232,724)
                                 – 1. The change in Acer’s revenue from FY2013 to FY2017 is a decline of
                                 34.11 percent.

                              3. How do the companies compare, based on profitability?
                                 Solution:
                                 Profitability can be assessed by comparing the amount of gross profit to rev-
                                 enue and the amount of net income to revenue. The following table presents
                                 these two profitability ratios—gross profit margin (gross profit divided by
                                 revenue) and net profit margin (net income divided by revenue)—for each
                                 year.

                                 years. Acer’s gross profit margin increased each year but remains signifi-
                                 cantly below that of Lenovo. Lenovo’s gross profit margin grew from FY2013
                                 to FY2015 and then declined in FY2016 and FY2017. Overall, Lenovo is the
                                 more profitable company, likely attributable to its larger size and commen-
                                 surate economies of scale. (Lenovo has the largest share of the personal

                                            describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including
                                            their uses and limitations

                           There are many relationships among financial accounts and various expected relation-
                           ships from one point in time to another. Ratios are a useful way of expressing these
                           relationships. Ratios express one quantity in relation to another, usually as a quotient.
                               Extensive academic research has examined the importance of ratios in predicting
                           stock returns (Ou and Penman, 1989; Abarbanell and Bushee, 1998) or credit failure
                           (Altman, 1968; Ohlson, 1980; Hopwood et al., 1994). This research has found that

financial statement ratios are effective in selecting investments and in predicting
financial distress. Practitioners routinely use ratios to derive and communicate the
value of companies and securities.
    Several aspects of ratio analysis are important to understand. First, the computed
ratio is not “the answer.” The ratio is an indicator of some aspect of a company’s per-
formance, telling what happened but not why it happened. For example, an analyst
might want to answer the question: Which of two companies was more profitable?
As demonstrated in the previous example, the net profit margin, which expresses
profit relative to revenue, can provide insight into this question. Net profit margin is
calculated by dividing net income by revenue:
   _ Net income
   	​ Revenue ​.​

Assume Company A has EUR100,000 of net income and Company B has EUR200,000
of net income. Company B generated twice as much income as Company A, but was it
more profitable? Assume further that Company A has EUR2,000,000 of revenue, and
thus a net profit margin of 5 percent, and Company B has EUR6,000,000 of revenue,
and thus a net profit margin of 3.33 percent. Expressing net income as a percentage
of revenue clarifies the relationship: For each EUR100 of revenue, Company A earns
EUR5 in net income, whereas Company B earns only EUR3.33 for each EUR100 of
revenue. So, we can now answer the question of which company was more profitable
in percentage terms: Company A was more profitable, as indicated by its higher net
profit margin of 5 percent. Note that Company A was more profitable despite the
fact that Company B reported higher absolute amounts of net income and revenue.
However, this ratio by itself does not tell us why Company A has a higher profit mar-
gin. Further analysis is required to determine the reason (perhaps higher relative sales
prices or better cost control or lower effective tax rates).
    Company size sometimes confers economies of scale, so the absolute amounts of
net income and revenue are useful in financial analysis. However, ratios control for
the effect of size, which enhances comparisons between companies and over time.
    A second important aspect of ratio analysis is that differences in accounting policies
(across companies and across time) can distort ratios, and a meaningful comparison,
therefore, may involve adjustments to the financial data. Third, not all ratios are nec-
essarily relevant to a particular analysis. The ability to select a relevant ratio or ratios
to answer the research question is an analytical skill. Finally, as with financial analysis
in general, ratio analysis does not stop with computation; interpretation of the result
is essential. In practice, differences in ratios across time and across companies can be
subtle, and interpretation is situation specific.


The Universe of Ratios
No authoritative bodies specify the exact formulas for computing ratios or provide a
standard, comprehensive list of ratios. Formulas and even names of ratios often differ
from analyst to analyst or from database to database. The number of different ratios
that can be created is practically limitless. Several widely accepted ratios, however,
have been found to be useful, which are the focus of this module. The analyst should
be aware that different ratios may be used in practice and that certain industries
have unique ratios tailored to the characteristics of that industry. When faced with
an unfamiliar ratio, the analyst can examine the underlying formula to gain insight
into what the ratio is measuring. For example, consider the following ratio formula:
    Operating income
   ______________
   	​ Average
              total assets ​.
398   Learning Module 11                                                                 Financial Analysis Techniques


                           Never having seen this ratio, an analyst might question whether a result of 12 percent
                           is better than 8 percent. The answer can be found in the ratio itself. The numerator
                           is operating income and the denominator is average total assets, so the ratio can be
                           interpreted as the amount of operating income generated per unit of assets. For every
                           EUR100 of average total assets, generating EUR12 of operating income is better than
                           generating EUR8 of operating income. Furthermore, it is apparent that this particular
                           ratio is an indicator of profitability (as well as efficiency in use of assets in generating
                           operating profits). When encountering a ratio for the first time, the analyst should
                           evaluate the numerator and denominator to assess what the ratio is attempting to
                           measure and how it should be interpreted. This is demonstrated in Example 3.

                           EXAMPLE 3

                              Interpreting a Financial Ratio
                              A US insurance company reports that its “combined ratio” is determined by
                              dividing losses and expenses incurred by net premiums earned. It reports the
                              following combined ratios:
                                                                        ​

                              1. Explain what this ratio is measuring and compare the results reported for
                                 each of the years shown in the chart. What other information might an ana-
                                 lyst want to review before making any conclusions on this information?
                                 Solution:
                                 The combined ratio is a profitability measure. The ratio is explaining how
                                 much costs (losses and expenses) were incurred for every dollar of revenue
                                 (net premiums earned). The underlying formula indicates that a lower value
                                 for this ratio is better. The year 5 ratio of 90.1 percent means that for every
                                 dollar of net premiums earned, the costs were USD0.901, yielding a gross
                                 profit of $0.099. Ratios greater than 100 percent indicate an overall loss. A
                                 review of the data indicates that there does not seem to be a consistent trend
                                 in this ratio. Profits were achieved in years 5 and 3. The results for years 4
                                 and 2 show the most significant costs at approximately 104 percent.
                                 The analyst would want to discuss this data further with management and
                                 understand the characteristics of the underlying business. He or she would
                                 want to understand why the results are so volatile. The analyst would also
                                 want to determine what should be used as a benchmark for this ratio.

                               The Operating income/Average total assets ratio is one of many versions of the
                           return on assets (ROA) ratio. Note that there are other ways of specifying this formula
                           based on how assets are defined. Some financial ratio databases compute ROA using
                           the ending value of assets rather than average assets. In limited cases, one may also
                           see beginning assets in the denominator. Which one is right? It depends on what you
                           are trying to measure and the underlying company trends. If the company has a stable
                           level of assets, the answer will not differ greatly under the three measures of assets
                           (beginning, average, and ending). However, if the assets are growing (or shrinking),
                           the results will differ among the three measures. When assets are growing, operating

income divided by ending assets may not make sense because some of the income would
have been generated before some assets were purchased, and this would understate
the company’s performance. Similarly, if beginning assets are used, some of the oper-
ating income later in the year may have been generated only because of the addition
of assets; therefore, the ratio would overstate the company’s performance. Because
operating income occurs throughout the period, it generally makes sense to use some
average measure of assets. A good general rule is that when an income statement or
cash flow statement number is in the numerator of a ratio and a balance sheet num-
ber is in the denominator, then an average should be used for the denominator. It is
generally not necessary to use averages when only balance sheet numbers are used
in both the numerator and denominator because both are determined as of the same
date. However, in some instances, even ratios that only use balance sheet data may
use averages. For example, return on equity (ROE), which is defined as net income
divided by average shareholders’ equity, can be decomposed into other ratios, some
of which only use balance sheet data. In decomposing ROE into component ratios, if
an average is used in one of the component ratios, then it should be used in the other
component ratios. The decomposition of ROE is discussed further in a later lesson.
    If an average is used, judgment is also required about what average should be
used. For simplicity, most ratio databases use a simple average of the beginning and
end-of-year balance sheet amounts. If the company’s business is seasonal so that levels
of assets vary by interim period (semiannual or quarterly), then it may be beneficial to
take an average over all interim periods, if available. (If the analyst is working within
a company and has access to monthly data, this can also be used.)


Value, Purposes, and Limitations of Ratio Analysis
The value of ratio analysis is that it enables a financial analyst to evaluate past perfor-
mance, assess the current financial position of the company, and gain insights useful
for projecting future results. As noted previously, the ratio itself is not “the answer”
but is an indicator of some aspect of a company’s performance. Financial ratios provide
insights into the following:
    ■   economic relationships within a company that help analysts project earnings
        and free cash flow;
    ■   a company’s financial flexibility, or ability to obtain the cash required to
        grow and meet its obligations, even if unexpected circumstances develop;
    ■   management’s ability;
    ■   changes in the company or industry over time; and
    ■   comparability with peer companies or the relevant industry(ies).
   Ratio analysis also has limitations. Factors to consider include the following:
    ■   The heterogeneity or homogeneity of a company’s operating activities.
        Companies may have divisions operating in many different industries. This
        can make it difficult to find comparable industry ratios to use for compari-
        son purposes.
    ■   The need to determine whether the results of the ratio analysis are consistent.
        One set of ratios may indicate a problem, whereas another set may indicate
        that the potential problem is only short term in nature.
    ■   The need to use judgment. A key issue is whether a ratio for a company
        is within a reasonable range. Although financial ratios are used to help
        assess the growth potential and risk of a company, they cannot be used
        alone to directly value a company or its securities, or to determine its

                                   creditworthiness. The entire operation of the company must be examined,
                                   and the external economic and industry setting in which it is operating must
                                   be considered when interpreting financial ratios.
                              ■    The use of alternative accounting methods. Companies frequently have
                                   latitude when choosing certain accounting methods. Ratios taken from
                                   financial statements that employ different accounting choices may not be
                                   comparable unless adjustments are made. Some important accounting con-
                                   siderations include the following:

                                   ●   FIFO (first in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out), or average cost inven-
                                       tory valuation methods (International Financial Reporting Standards
                                       [IFRS] does not allow LIFO);
                                   ●   Cost or equity methods of accounting for unconsolidated affiliates;
                                   ●   Straight-line or accelerated methods of depreciation; and
                                   ●   Operating or finance lease treatment for lessors (under US GAAP, the
                                       type of lease affects classifications of expenses; under IFRS, operating
                                       lease treatment for lessors is not applicable).
                               Convergence efforts between IFRS and US GAAP make the financial statements
                           of different companies more comparable and may overcome some of these difficulties.
                           Nonetheless, there will remain accounting choices that the analyst must consider.


                           Sources of Ratios
                           Ratios may be computed using data obtained directly from companies’ financial state-
                           ments or from a database such as Bloomberg, Compustat, FactSet, or Thomson Reuters.
                           The information provided by the database may include information as reported in
                           companies’ financial statements and ratios calculated based on the information. These
                           databases are popular because they provide easy access to many years of historical data
                           so that trends over time can be examined. They also allow for ratio calculations based
                           on periods other than the company’s fiscal year, such as for the trailing 12 months
                           (TTM) or most recent quarter (MRQ).

                           EXAMPLE 4

                             Trailing 12 Months

                             1. On 15 July, an analyst is examining a company with a fiscal year ending on
                                31 December. Use the following data to calculate the company’s TTM earn-
                                ings (for the period ended 30 June 2018):

                                  ■    Earnings for the year ended 31 December 2017: USD1,200;
                                  ■    Earnings for the six months ended 30 June 2017: USD550; and
                                  ■    Earnings for the six months ended 30 June 2018: USD750.
                                  Solution:
                                  The company’s TTM earnings is USD1,400, calculated as USD1,200 –
                                  USD550 + USD750.

                               Analysts should be aware that the underlying formulas for ratios may differ by
                           vendor. The formula used should be obtained from the vendor, and the analyst should
                           determine whether any adjustments are necessary. Furthermore, database providers
                           often exercise judgment when classifying items. For example, operating income may
Common Size Balance Sheets and Income Statements                                                 401


not appear directly on a company’s income statement, and the vendor may use judg-
ment to classify income statement items as “operating” or “non-operating.” Variation
in such judgments would affect any computation involving operating income. It is
therefore a good practice to use the same source for data when comparing different
companies or when evaluating the historical record of a single company. Analysts
should verify the consistency of formulas and data classifications by the data source.
Analysts should also be mindful of the judgments made by a vendor in data classifi-
cations and refer to the source financial statements until they are comfortable that
the classifications are appropriate.
    Collection of financial data from regulatory filings and calculation of ratios can
be automated. The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a mechanism
that attaches “smart tags” to financial information (e.g., total assets), so that software
can automatically collect the data and perform desired computations. The organi-
zation developing XBRL (www​.xbrl​.org) is an international nonprofit consortium of
more than 600 members from companies, associations, and agencies, including the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Many stock exchanges and regu-
latory agencies around the world now use XBRL for receiving and distributing public
financial reports from listed companies.
    Analysts can compare a subject company to similar (peer) companies in vendor
databases or use aggregate industry data. For non-public companies, aggregate
industry data can be obtained from such sources as Annual Statement Studies by
the Risk Management Association or Dun & Bradstreet. These publications typically
provide industry data with companies sorted into quartiles. By definition, 25 percent
of companies’ ratios fall within the lowest quartile, 25 percent have ratios between the
lower quartile and median value, and so on. Analysts can then determine a company’s
relative standing in the industry.

Common-size analysis involves expressing financial data, including entire financial
statements, in relation to a single financial statement item, or base. Items used most
frequently as the bases are total assets or revenue. In essence, common-size analysis
creates a ratio between every financial statement item and the base item. Common-size
analysis was demonstrated in earlier modules for the income statement, balance sheet,
and cash flow statement. In this lesson, we present common-size analysis of financial
statements in greater detail and include further discussion of their interpretation.
    Common-Size Analysis of the Balance Sheet A vertical common-size balance
sheet, prepared by dividing each item on the balance sheet by the same period’s total
assets and expressing the results as percentages, highlights the composition of the
balance sheet. What is the mix of assets being used? How is the company financing
itself? How does one company’s balance sheet composition compare with that of peer
companies, and what are the reasons for any differences? A horizontal common-size
balance sheet, prepared by computing the increase or decrease in percentage terms
of each balance sheet item from the prior year or prepared by dividing the quantity
of each item by a base year quantity of the item, highlights changes in items. These
changes can be compared to expectations.

                               Exhibit 6 presents a vertical common-size (partial) balance sheet for a hypothetical
                           company in two time periods. In this example, receivables have increased from 35
                           percent to 57 percent of total assets and the ratio has increased by 63 percent from
                           Period 1 to Period 2. What are possible reasons for such an increase? The increase might
                           indicate that the company is making more of its sales on a credit basis rather than a
                           cash basis, perhaps in response to some action taken by a competitor. Alternatively,
                           the increase in receivables as a percentage of assets may have occurred because of a
                           change in another current asset category, for example, a decrease in the level of inven-
                           tory; the analyst would then need to investigate why that asset category has changed.
                           Another possible reason for the increase in receivables as a percentage of assets is that
                           the company has lowered its credit standards, relaxed its collection procedures, or
                           adopted more aggressive revenue recognition policies. The analyst can turn to other
                           comparisons and ratios (e.g., comparing the rate of growth in accounts receivable
                           with the rate of growth in sales) to help determine which explanation is most likely.

                           Common-Size Analysis of the Income Statement
                           A vertical common-size income statement divides each income statement item by
                           revenue, or sometimes by total assets (especially in the case of financial institutions).
                           If there are multiple revenue sources, a decomposition of revenue in percentage terms
                           is useful. Exhibit 7 presents a hypothetical company’s vertical common-size income
                           statement in two time periods. Revenue is separated into the company’s four services,
                           each shown as a percentage of total revenue.
                                In this example, revenues from Service A have become a far greater percentage
                           of the company’s total revenue (30 percent in Period 1 and 45 percent in Period 2).
                           What are possible reasons for and implications of this change in business mix? Did
                           the company make a strategic decision to sell more of Service A, perhaps because it
                           is more profitable? Apparently not, because the company’s earnings before interest,
                           taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined from 53 percent of sales to
                           45 percent, so other possible explanations should be examined. In addition, we note
                           from the composition of operating expenses that the main reason for this decline in
                           profitability is that salaries and employee benefits have increased from 15 percent to
                           25 percent of total revenue. Are more highly compensated employees required for
                           Service A? Were higher training costs incurred to increase revenues from Service A?
                           If the analyst wants to predict future performance, the causes of these changes must
                           be understood.
                                In addition, Exhibit 7 shows that the company’s income tax as a percentage of
                           sales has declined dramatically (from 15 percent to 8 percent). Furthermore, taxes as
                           a percentage of earnings before tax (EBT) (the effective tax rate, which is usually the
Cross-Sectional, Trend Analysis, and Relationships in Financial Statements                     403


more relevant comparison), have decreased from 36 percent (= 15/42) to 24 percent
(= 8/34). Is Service A, which in Period 2 is a greater percentage of total revenue,
provided in a jurisdiction with lower tax rates? If not, what is the explanation for the
change in effective tax rate?
   The observations based on Exhibit 7 summarize the issues that can be raised
through analysis of the vertical common-size income statement.

                 their uses and limitations

As noted previously, ratios and common-size statements derive their utility through
comparison. Cross-sectional analysis (sometimes called “relative analysis”) compares
a specific metric for one company with the same metric for another company or group
of companies measured at the same point in time or over the same range of time,
allowing comparisons even though the companies might be of significantly different
sizes or operate in different currencies. This is illustrated in Exhibit 8.

                           Exhibit 8 presents a vertical common-size (partial) balance sheet for two hypothetical
                           companies at the same point in time. Company 1 is clearly more liquid (liquidity is a
                           function of how quickly assets can be converted into cash) than Company 2, which has
                           only 12 percent of assets available as cash, compared with the highly liquid Company 1,
                           which has 38 percent of assets available as cash. Given that cash is generally a relatively
                           low-yielding asset and thus not a particularly efficient use of excess funds, why does
                           Company 1 hold such a large percentage of total assets in cash? Perhaps the company
                           is preparing for an acquisition, or maintains a large cash position as insulation from
                           a particularly volatile operating environment. Another issue highlighted by the com-
                           parison in this example is the relatively high percentage of receivables in Company 2’s
                           assets, which may indicate a greater proportion of credit sales, overall changes in asset
                           composition, lower credit or collection standards, or aggressive accounting policies.


                           Trend Analysis
                           When looking at financial statements and ratios, trends in the data, whether they are
                           improving or deteriorating, are as important as the current absolute or relative levels.
                           Trend analysis provides important information regarding historical performance and
                           growth and, given a sufficiently long history of accurate seasonal information, can be
                           of great assistance as a planning and forecasting tool for management and analysts.
                               Exhibit 9 presents a partial balance sheet for a hypothetical company over five
                           periods. The last two columns of the table show the changes for Period 5 compared
                           with Period 4, expressed both in absolute currency (in this case, dollars) and in per-
                           centages. A small percentage change could hide a significant currency change and vice
                           versa, prompting the analyst to investigate the reasons despite one of the changes being
                           relatively small. In this example, the largest percentage change was in investments,
                           which decreased by 33.3 percent. However, an examination of the absolute currency
                           amount of changes shows that investments changed by only USD2 million, and the
                           more significant change was the USD12 million increase in receivables.
                               Another way to present data covering a period of time is to show each item in
                           relation to the same item in a base year (i.e., a horizontal common-size balance sheet).
                           Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 11 illustrate alternative presentations of horizontal common-size
                           balance sheets. Exhibit 10 presents the information from the same partial balance
                           sheet as in Exhibit 9, but indexes each item relative to the same item in Period 1. For
                           example, in Period 2, the company had USD29 million cash, which is 74 percent or
                           0.74 of the amount of cash it had in Period 1. Expressed as an index relative to Period
                           1, where each item in Period 1 is given a value of 1.00, the value in Period 2 would
                           be 0.74 (USD29/USD39 = 0.74). In Period 3, the company had USD27 million cash,
                           which is 69 percent of the amount of cash it had in Period 1 (USD27/USD39 = 0.69).
Cross-Sectional, Trend Analysis, and Relationships in Financial Statements                   405


    Exhibit 11 presents the percentage change in each item, relative to the previous year.
For example, the change in cash from Period 1 to Period 2 was –25.6 percent (USD29/
USD39 – 1 = –0.256), and the change in cash from Period 2 to Period 3 was –6.9 per-
cent (USD27/USD29 – 1 = –0.069). An analyst will select the horizontal common-size
balance that addresses the particular period of interest. Exhibit 10 clearly highlights
that in Period 5 compared to Period 1, the company has less than half the amount of
cash, four times the amount of investments, and eight times the amount of property,
plant, and equipment. Exhibit 11 highlights year-to-year changes: For example, cash
has declined in each period. Presenting data this way highlights significant changes.
Again, note that a mathematically big change is not necessarily an important change.
For example, fixed assets increased 100 percent (i.e., doubled between Period 1 and 2);
however, as a proportion of total assets, fixed assets increased from 1 percent of total
assets to 2 percent of total assets. The company’s working capital assets (receivables
and inventory) are a far higher proportion of total assets and would likely warrant
more attention from an analyst.
    An analysis of horizontal common-size balance sheets highlights structural changes
that have occurred in a business. Past trends are obviously not necessarily an accurate
predictor of the future, especially when the economic or competitive environment
changes. An examination of past trends is more valuable when the macroeconomic
and competitive environments are relatively stable and when the analyst is reviewing
a stable or mature business. However, even in less stable contexts, historical analysis
can serve as a basis for developing expectations. Understanding of past trends is
helpful in assessing whether these trends are likely to continue or if the trend is likely
to change direction.

                           One measure of success is for a company to grow at a rate greater than the rate of the
                           overall market in which it operates. Companies that grow slowly may find themselves
                           unable to attract equity capital. Conversely, companies that grow too quickly may find
                           that their administrative and management information systems cannot keep up with
                           the rate of expansion.


                           Relationships Among Financial Statements
                           Trend data generated by a horizontal common-size analysis can be compared across
                           financial statements. For example, the growth rate of assets for the hypothetical
                           company in Exhibit 12 can be compared with the company’s growth in revenue over
                           the same period of time. If revenue is growing more quickly than assets, the com-
                           pany may be increasing its efficiency (i.e., generating more revenue for every dollar
                           invested in assets).
                               As another example, consider the following year-over-year percentage changes
                           for a hypothetical company:



                             Exhibit 12: Year-over-Year Percentage Changes

                           Revenue                                                                    +20%

                           Net income                                                                  +25%
                           Operating cash flow                                                         –10%
                           Total assets                                                                +30%

Net income is growing faster than revenue, which indicates increasing profitability.
However, the analyst would need to determine whether the faster growth in net income
resulted from continuing operations or from non-operating, non-recurring items. In
addition, the 10 percent decline in operating cash flow despite increasing revenue and
net income clearly warrants further investigation because it could indicate a problem
with earnings quality (perhaps aggressive reporting of revenue). Lastly, the fact that
assets have grown faster than revenue indicates the company’s efficiency may be
declining. The analyst should examine the composition of the increase in assets and
the reasons for the changes. Example 5 illustrates a historical example of a company
for which comparisons of trend data from different financial statements were actually
indicative of aggressive accounting policies.

EXAMPLE 5

   Use of Comparative Growth Information1
   In July 1996, Sunbeam, a US company, brought in new management to turn
   the company around. In the following year, 1997, using 1996 as the base, the
   following was observed based on reported numbers:
                                                ​




            Exhibit 13: Sunbeam Revenue
                                                ​




                                                ​




          Revenue                                      +19 percent

          Inventory                                    +58 percent
          Receivables                                  +38 percent
                                                ​




        It is generally more desirable to observe inventory and receivables growing
   at a slower (or similar) rate than revenue growth. Receivables growing faster
   than revenue can indicate operational issues, such as lower credit standards
   or aggressive accounting policies for revenue recognition. Similarly, inventory
   growing faster than revenue can indicate an operational problem with obsoles-
   cence or aggressive accounting policies, such as an improper overstatement of
   inventory to increase profits.
        In this case, the explanation lay in aggressive accounting policies. Sunbeam
   was later charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission with improperly
   accelerating the recognition of revenue and engaging in other practices, such as
   billing customers for inventory prior to shipment.

                           Graphs facilitate comparison of performance and financial structure over time, high-
                           lighting changes in significant aspects of business operations. In addition, graphs
                           provide the analyst (and management) with a visual overview of risk trends in a busi-
                           ness. Graphs may also be used effectively to communicate the analyst’s conclusions
                           regarding financial condition and risk management aspects.
                               Exhibit 14 presents the information from Exhibit 9 in a stacked column format. The
                           graph makes the significant decline in cash and growth in receivables (both in absolute
                           terms and as a percentage of assets) readily apparent. In Exhibit 14, the vertical axis
                           shows US dollar millions and the horizontal axis denotes the period.
                               Choosing the appropriate graph to communicate the most significant conclusions
                           of a financial analysis is a skill. In general, pie graphs are most useful to communicate
                           the composition of a total value (e.g., assets over a limited amount of time, say one or
                           two periods). Line graphs are useful when the focus is on the change in amount for a
                           limited number of items over a relatively longer time period. When the composition
                           and amounts, as well as their change over time, are all important, a stacked column
                           graph can be useful.

                           When comparing Period 5 with Period 4, the growth in receivables appears to be
                           within normal bounds; but when comparing Period 5 with earlier periods, the dramatic
                           growth becomes apparent. In the same manner, a simple line graph will also illustrate
                           the growth trends in key financial variables. Exhibit 15 presents the information from
                           Exhibit 9A as a line graph, illustrating the growth of assets of a hypothetical company
                           over five periods. The steady decline in cash, volatile movements of inventory, and
                           dramatic growth of receivables is clearly illustrated. Again, the vertical axis is shown
                           in US dollar millions and the horizontal axis denotes periods.

Regression Analysis
When analyzing the trend in a specific line item or ratio, frequently it is possible simply
to visually evaluate the changes. For more complex situations, regression analysis can
help identify relationships (or correlation) between variables. For example, a regres-
sion analysis could relate a company’s sales to GDP over time, providing insight into
whether the company is cyclical. In addition, the statistical relationship between sales
and GDP could be used as a basis for forecasting sales.
    Other examples in which regression analysis may be useful include the relation-
ship between a company’s sales and inventory over time, or the relationship between
hotel occupancy and a company’s hotel revenues. In addition to providing a basis for
forecasting, regression analysis facilitates identification of items or ratios that are not
behaving as expected, given historical statistical relationships.

In the previous lesson, we focused on ratios resulting from common-size analysis.
In this lesson, we expand the discussion to include other commonly used financial
ratios and the broad classes into which they are categorized. There is some overlap
410   Learning Module 11                                                                  Financial Analysis Techniques


                           with common-size financial statement ratios. For example, a common indicator of
                           profitability is the net profit margin, which is calculated as net income divided by
                           sales. This ratio appears on a vertical common-size income statement. Other ratios
                           involve information from multiple financial statements or even data from outside the
                           financial statements.
                               Because of the large number of ratios, it is helpful to think about ratios in terms of
                           broad categories based on what aspects of performance a ratio is intended to detect.
                           Financial analysts and data vendors use a variety of categories to classify ratios. The
                           category names and the ratios included in each category can differ. Common ratio
                           categories include activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability, which were introduced
                           in earlier modules in Corporate Issuers. These categories are summarized in Exhibit
                           16. Each category measures a different aspect of the company’s business, but all are
                           useful in evaluating a company’s overall ability to generate cash flows from operating
                           its business and the associated risks.

                           Activity        Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company’s operations, such as
                                           the collection of receivables and management of inventory.
                           Liquidity       Liquidity ratios measure the company’s ability to meet its short-term
                                           obligations.
                           Solvency        Solvency ratios measure a company’s ability to meet long-term obligations.
                                           Subsets of these ratios are also known as “leverage” and “long-term debt”
                                           ratios.
                           Profitability   Profitability ratios measure the company’s ability to generate profits from
                                           its resources (assets) or sales.




                           Interpretation and Context
                           Financial ratios can be interpreted only in the context of other information. In general,
                           the financial ratios of a company are compared with those of its major competitors
                           (cross-sectional and trend analysis) and to the company’s prior periods (trend analysis).
                           The goal is to understand the underlying causes of divergence between a company’s
                           ratios and those of the industry. Even ratios that remain consistent require understand-
                           ing because consistency can sometimes indicate accounting policies selected to smooth
                           earnings. An analyst should evaluate financial ratios in the context of the following:
                               1. Prior period results. Trend analysis can reveal whether a company’s perfor-
                                  mance and position are weakening or strengthening.
                               2. Expectations. These are point or range estimates for key values, such as sales
                                  growth, profit margins, and leverage ratios, that are specified by the analyst
                                  or external analysts before results are published. Differences from expecta-
                                  tions should be scrutinized for setting expectations in subsequent periods.
                               3. Industry peers and competitors (cross-sectional analysis). A company can be
                                  compared with others in its industry by relating its financial ratios to indus-
                                  try norms or to a subset of the companies in an industry. When industry
                                  norms are used to make judgments, care must be taken for the following
                                  reasons:
Activity Ratios                                                                                    411


        ●   Companies may have several different lines of business. This will cause
            aggregate financial ratios to be distorted. It is better to examine indus-
            try-specific ratios by lines of business.
        ●   Differences in business model and corporate strategies can affect certain
            financial ratios.
        ●   Some ratios are industry specific, and not all ratios are important to all
            industries.
        ●   Differences in accounting methods used by companies can distort finan-
            cial ratios.

    4. Company goals and strategy. Actual ratios can be compared with company
       objectives to determine whether objectives are being attained and whether
       the results are consistent with the company’s strategy.
    5. Economic conditions. For cyclical companies, financial ratios tend to
       improve when the economy is strong and weaken during recessions.
       Therefore, financial ratios should be examined in light of the current phase
       of the business cycle.
    The following lessons discuss the calculation and interpretation of activity, liquidity,
solvency, and profitability ratios using a company’s financial statements.

                  calculate and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability
                  ratios

Activity ratios, also known as asset utilization ratios or operating efficiency ratios,
are measures of operational performance—how effectively the company is using
working capital and longer term assets. Since working capital efficiency has a direct
impact on liquidity, some activity ratios are also useful in assessing liquidity.

                           Activity ratios generally combine information from the income statement in the
                           numerator with balance sheet items in the denominator. Because the income state-
                           ment measures what happened during a period, whereas the balance sheet shows the
                           condition only at the end of the period, average balance sheet figures are normally
                           used for consistency.
                               Activity ratios can be computed for any annual or interim period, but care must be
                           taken in the interpretation and comparison across periods. For example, if the same
                           company had cost of goods sold for the first quarter (90 days) of the following year
                           of EUR35,000 and average inventory of EUR11,000, the inventory turnover would be
                           3.18 times. However, this turnover rate is 3.18 times per quarter, which is not directly
                           comparable to the 12 times per year in the preceding year. In this case, we can annualize
                           the quarterly inventory turnover rate by multiplying the quarterly turnover by 4 (12
                           months/3 months; or by 4.06, using 365 days/90 days) for comparison to the annual
                           turnover rate. So, the quarterly inventory turnover is equivalent to a 12.72 annual
                           inventory turnover (or 12.90 if we annualize the ratio using a 90-day quarter and a
                           365-day year). To compute the DOH using quarterly data, we can use the quarterly
                           turnover rate and the number of days in the quarter for the numerator—or, we can use
                           the annualized turnover rate and 365 days; either results in DOH of around 28.3, with
                           slight differences due to rounding (90/3.18 = 28.30 and 365/12.90 = 28.29). Another
                           time-related computational detail is that for companies using a 52/53-week annual
                           period and for leap years, the actual days in the year should be used rather than 365.
                               In some cases, an analyst may want to know how many days of inventory are on
                           hand at the end of the year rather than the average for the year. In this case, it would
                           be appropriate to use the year-end inventory balance in the computation rather
                           than the average. If the company is growing rapidly or if costs are increasing rapidly,
                           analysts should consider using cost of goods sold just for the fourth quarter in this
                           computation because the cost of goods sold of earlier quarters may not be relevant.
                           Example 6 further demonstrates computation of activity ratios using Hong Kong Stock
                           Exchange (HKEX)–listed Lenovo Group Limited.

      year ended 31 March 2018.



Interpretation of Activity Ratios

Inventory Turnover and DOH
Inventory turnover indicates the resources tied up in inventory (i.e., the carrying costs)
and, therefore, can be used to indicate inventory management effectiveness. In general,
inventory turnover and DOH (days of inventory on hand) should be benchmarked
against industry norms.
    A high inventory turnover ratio relative to industry norms might indicate highly
effective inventory management. Alternatively, a high inventory turnover ratio (and
commensurately low DOH) could possibly indicate the company does not carry
adequate inventory, so shortages could potentially hurt revenue. To assess which
explanation is more likely, the analyst can compare the company’s revenue growth
with that of the industry. Slower growth combined with higher inventory turnover
could indicate inadequate inventory levels. Revenue growth at or above the industry’s
growth supports the interpretation that the higher turnover reflects greater inventory
management efficiency.

                                      A low inventory turnover ratio (and commensurately high DOH) relative to the
                                  rest of the industry could be an indicator of slow-moving inventory, perhaps because
                                  of technological obsolescence or a change in fashion. Again, comparing the company’s
                                  sales growth with the industry can offer insight.

                                  Receivables Turnover and DSO
                                  The number of DSO (days of sales outstanding) reflects how fast the company collects
                                  cash from customers to whom it offers credit. Although limiting the numerator to
                                  sales made on credit in the receivables turnover would be more appropriate, credit
                                  sales information is usually not available to analysts; therefore, revenue as reported
                                  in the income statement is generally used.
                                      As with inventory management, comparison of the company’s sales growth rel-
                                  ative to the industry can help the analyst assess whether sales are being lost due to
                                  stringent credit policies. In addition, comparing the company’s estimates of uncollect-
                                  ible accounts receivable and actual credit losses with past experience and with peer
                                  companies can help assess whether low turnover reflects credit management issues.
                                  Companies often provide details of receivables aging (how much receivables have
                                  been outstanding by age). This can be used along with DSO to understand trends in
                                  collection, as demonstrated in Example 7.

    Note: Lenovo’s footnotes disclose that general trade customers are provided with credit terms
    ranging from 0 to 120 days.

        These data indicate that total accounts receivable increased by 11 percent
    (net, after impairment) in FY2017 versus FY2016, while total sales increased by
    only 5.4 percent. Further, the percentage of receivables in all categories older
    than 30 days has increased over the three-year period, indicating that customers
    are indeed taking longer to pay. Conversely, the provision for impairment (esti-
    mate of uncollectible accounts) has declined as a percent of total receivables.
    Considering all this information, the company may be increasing customer
    financing purposely to drive its sales growth. They also may be underestimating
    the impairment. This should be investigated further by the analyst.


Payables Turnover and the Number of Days of Payables
The number of days of payables reflects the average number of days the company
takes to pay its suppliers, and the payables turnover ratio measures how many times
per year the company theoretically pays off all its creditors. A payables turnover
ratio that is high (low days payable) relative to the industry could indicate that the
company is not making full use of available credit facilities; alternatively, it could
result from a company taking advantage of early payment discounts. An excessively
low turnover ratio (high days payable) could indicate trouble making payments on
time, or alternatively, exploitation of lenient supplier terms. This is another example
in which it is useful to look simultaneously at other ratios. If liquidity ratios indicate
that the company has sufficient cash and other short-term assets to pay obligations
and yet the days payable ratio is relatively high, the analyst would favor the lenient
supplier credit and collection policies as an explanation.

Working Capital Turnover
Working capital turnover indicates how efficiently the company generates revenue
with its working capital. For example, a working capital turnover ratio of 4.0 indicates
that the company generates EUR4 of revenue for every EUR1 of working capital. A
high working capital turnover ratio indicates greater efficiency (i.e., the company is
generating a high level of revenues relative to working capital). For some companies,
working capital can be near zero or negative, rendering this ratio incapable of being
interpreted. The following two ratios are more useful in those circumstances.

Fixed Asset Turnover
This ratio measures how efficiently the company generates revenues from its invest-
ments in fixed assets. Generally, a higher fixed asset turnover ratio indicates more
efficient use of fixed assets in generating revenue. A low ratio can indicate inefficiency,
a capital-intensive business environment, or a new business not yet operating at full
capacity—in which case the analyst will not be able to link the ratio directly to effi-
ciency. In addition, asset turnover can be affected by factors other than a company’s
efficiency. The fixed asset turnover ratio would be lower for a company whose assets
are newer (and, therefore, less depreciated and so reflected in the financial statements
416   Learning Module 11                                                               Financial Analysis Techniques


                           at a higher carrying value) than the ratio for a company with older assets (that are
                           thus more depreciated and so reflected at a lower carrying value). The fixed asset ratio
                           can be erratic because, although revenue may have a steady growth rate, increases
                           in fixed assets may not follow a smooth pattern; so, every year-to-year change in the
                           ratio does not necessarily indicate important changes in the company’s efficiency.

                           Total Asset Turnover
                           The total asset turnover ratio measures the company’s overall ability to generate
                           revenues with a given level of assets. A ratio of 1.20 would indicate that the company
                           is generating EUR1.20 of revenues for every EUR1 of average assets. A higher ratio
                           indicates greater efficiency. Because this ratio includes both fixed and current assets,
                           inefficient working capital management can distort overall interpretations. It is
                           therefore helpful to analyze working capital and fixed asset turnover ratios separately.
                               A low asset turnover ratio can be an indicator of inefficiency or of relative capital
                           intensity of the business. The ratio also reflects strategic decisions by management—for
                           example, the decision whether to use a more labor-intensive (and less capital-intensive)
                           approach to its business or a more capital-intensive (and less labor-intensive) approach.
                               When interpreting activity ratios, the analysts should examine not only the
                           individual ratios but also the collection of relevant ratios to determine the overall
                           efficiency of a company. Example 8 demonstrates the evaluation of activity ratios,
                           both narrow (e.g., days of inventory on hand) and broad (e.g., total asset turnover)
                           for a hypothetical manufacturer.

                                  These ratios indicate that the company has improved on all three measures
                              of activity over the four-year period. The company appears to be managing its
                              inventory more efficiently, is collecting receivables faster, and is generating a
                              higher level of revenues relative to total assets. The overall trend appears good,
                              but thus far, the analyst has only determined what happened. A more important
                              question is why the ratios improved, because understanding good changes as well
                              as bad ones facilitates judgments about the company’s future performance. To
                              answer this question, the analyst examines company financial reports as well as
                              external information about the industry and economy. In examining the annual
                              report, the analyst notes that in the fourth quarter of 2018, the company experi-
                              enced an “inventory correction” and that the company recorded an allowance for
                              the decline in market value and obsolescence of inventory of about 15 percent
                              of year-end inventory value (compared with about a 6 percent allowance in the
                              prior year). This reduction in the value of inventory accounts for a large portion
                              of the decline in DOH from 40.70 in 2017 to 35.68 in 2018. Management claims

   that this inventory obsolescence is a short-term issue; analysts can watch DOH
   in future interim periods to confirm this assertion. In any event, all else being
   equal, the analyst would likely expect DOH to return to a level closer to 40 days
   going forward.
        More positive interpretations can be drawn from the total asset turnover.
   The analyst finds that the company’s revenues increased more than 35 percent,
   whereas total assets increased only by about 6 percent. Based on external infor-
   mation about the industry and economy, the analyst attributes the increased
   revenues both to overall growth in the industry and to the company’s increased
   market share. Management was able to achieve growth in revenues with a com-
   paratively modest increase in assets, leading to an improvement in total asset
   turnover. Note further that part of the reason for the increase in asset turnover
   is lower DOH and DSO.




LIQUIDITY RATIOS

               calculate and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability
               ratios

Liquidity analysis measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. In
the short run, a company’s sources of liquidity typically include cash and marketable
securities on hand and debt issuance. In the longer run, for non-financial companies,
liquidity is addressed by cash flows from operations and managing the structure of
liabilities, such as the timing of debt maturities (see the following discussion on the
financial sector).
    The level of liquidity needed differs from one industry to another. A particular
company’s liquidity position may vary according to the anticipated need for funds at
any given time. Judging whether a company has adequate liquidity requires analysis
of its historical funding requirements, current liquidity position, anticipated future
funding needs, and options for reducing funding needs or attracting additional funds
(including actual and potential sources of such funding).
    Larger companies are usually better able to control the level and composition
of their liabilities than smaller companies. Therefore, they may have more potential
funding sources, including public capital and money markets. Greater discretionary
access to capital markets also reduces the size of the liquidity buffer needed relative
to companies without such access.
    Contingent liabilities, such as letters of credit or financial guarantees, can also be
relevant when assessing liquidity. The importance of contingent liabilities varies for
the non-banking and banking sector. In the non-banking sector, contingent liabilities
(usually disclosed in the footnotes to the company’s financial statements) represent
potential cash outflows, and when appropriate, should be included in an assessment of
a company’s liquidity. In the banking sector, contingent liabilities represent potentially
significant cash outflows that are not dependent on the bank’s financial condition.
Although outflows in normal market circumstances typically may be low, a general
macroeconomic or market crisis can trigger a substantial increase in cash outflows
related to contingent liabilities because of the increase in defaults and business
bankruptcies that often accompany such events. In addition, such crises are usually
418   Learning Module 11                                                                Financial Analysis Techniques


                           characterized by diminished levels of overall liquidity, which can further exacerbate
                           funding shortfalls. Therefore, for the banking sector, the effect of contingent liabilities
                           on liquidity warrants particular attention.


                           Calculation of Liquidity Ratios
                           Common liquidity ratios, introduced in earlier modules in Corporate Issuers, are
                           presented in Exhibit 22. These liquidity ratios reflect a company’s position at a point
                           in time and, therefore, typically use data from the ending balance sheet rather than
                           averages.

                           The defensive interval ratio measures how long a company can pay its daily cash
                           expenditures using only its existing liquid assets, without additional cash flow coming
                           in. This ratio is similar to the “burn rate” often computed for early-stage companies
                           that are funded by venture capital funds and company insiders. The numerator of this
                           ratio includes the same liquid assets used in the quick ratio, and the denominator is
                           an estimate of daily cash expenditures. To obtain daily cash expenditures, the total of
                           cash expenditures for the period is divided by the number of days in the period. Total
                           cash expenditures for a period can be approximated by summing all expenses on the
                           income statement—such as cost of goods sold; selling, general, and administrative
                           expenses; and research and development expenses—and then subtracting any non-cash
                           expenses, such as depreciation and amortization (typically, taxes are not included).


                           Interpretation of Liquidity Ratios
                           In the following, we discuss the interpretation of the five basic liquidity measures
                           presented in Exhibit 22.

                           Current Ratio
                           A higher current ratio indicates a higher level of liquidity (i.e., a greater ability to
                           meet short-term obligations). A lower ratio indicates less liquidity, implying a greater
                           reliance on operating cash flow and outside financing to meet short-term obligations.
                           The current ratio implicitly assumes that inventories and accounts receivable are
                           indeed liquid (which is presumably not the case when related turnover ratios are low).
Liquidity Ratios                                                                                 419


Quick Ratio
The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio because it includes only
the more liquid current assets (sometimes referred to as “quick assets”) in relation to
current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a higher quick ratio indicates greater liquidity.
    The quick ratio reflects the fact that certain current assets—such as prepaid
expenses, some taxes, and employee-related prepayments—represent costs of the
current period that have been paid in advance and cannot usually be converted back
into cash. This ratio also reflects the fact that inventory might not be easily and quickly
converted into cash, and furthermore, that a company probably would not be able to
sell all of its inventory for an amount equal to its carrying value, especially if it were
required to sell the inventory quickly. In situations in which inventories are illiquid
(as indicated, for example, by low inventory turnover ratios), the quick ratio may be
a better indicator of liquidity than the current ratio.

Cash Ratio
The cash ratio normally represents a reliable measure of an entity’s liquidity in a crisis
situation. Only highly marketable short-term investments and cash are included. In
a general market crisis, the fair value of marketable securities could decrease signifi-
cantly as a result of market factors, in which case even this ratio might not provide
reliable information.

Defensive Interval Ratio
The defensive interval ratio measures how long the company can continue to pay its
expenses from its existing liquid assets without receiving any additional cash inflow.
A defensive interval ratio of 50 would indicate that the company can continue to pay
its operating expenses for 50 days before running out of quick assets, assuming no
additional cash inflows. A higher defensive interval ratio indicates greater liquidity. If
a company’s defensive interval ratio is very low relative to peer companies or to the
company’s own history, the analyst would want to ascertain whether there is sufficient
cash inflow expected to mitigate the low defensive interval ratio.

Cash Conversion Cycle (Net Operating Cycle)
This cash conversion cycle metric indicates the amount of time that elapses from the
point when a company invests in working capital until the point at which the company
collects cash. A shorter cash conversion cycle indicates greater liquidity. A short cash
conversion cycle implies that the company only needs to finance its inventory and
accounts receivable for a short period of time. A longer cash conversion cycle indicates
lower liquidity; it implies that the company must finance its inventory and accounts
receivable for a longer period of time, possibly indicating a need for a higher level
of capital to fund current assets. Example 9 demonstrates the advantages of a short
cash conversion cycle as well as how a company’s business strategies are reflected in
financial ratios.

   Evaluation of Liquidity Measures

   days of receivables, inventory, and accounts payable, as well as the overall cash

                                The minimal DOH indicates that Apple maintains lean inventories, which is
                            attributable to key aspects of the company’s business model where manufacturing
                            is outsourced. In isolation, the increase in number of days payable (from 86 days
                            in FY2015 to 112 days in FY2017) might suggest an inability to pay suppliers;
                            however, in Apple’s case, the balance sheet (not shown here) indicates that the
                            company has more than USD70 billion of cash and short-term investments,
                            which would be more than enough to pay suppliers sooner if Apple chose to do
                            so. Instead, Apple takes advantage of the favorable credit terms granted by its
                            suppliers. The overall effect is a negative cash cycle, a somewhat unusual result.
                            Instead of requiring additional capital to fund working capital as is the case for
                            most companies, Apple has excess cash to invest for over 50 days during that
                            three-year period (reflected on the balance sheet as short-term investments) on
                            which it is earning, rather than paying, interest.

                            Bounds and Context of Financial Measures
                            The previous example focused on the cash conversion cycle, which many com-
                            panies identify as a key performance metric. The less positive the number of
                            days in the cash conversion cycle, typically, the better it is considered to be.
                            However, is this always true?
                                This example considers the following question: If a larger negative number
                            of days in a cash conversion cycle is considered to be a desirable performance
                            metric, does identifying a company with a large negative cash conversion cycle
                            necessarily imply good performance?
                                Using a historical example, National Datacomputer, a technology company,
                            had large negative number of days in its cash conversion cycle during the 2005
                            to 2009 period. In 2008, its cash conversion cycle was –275.5 days.

       National Datacomputer had a negative cash conversion cycle because the
   company’s accounts payable increased substantially over the period. An increase
   from approximately 66 days in 2005 to 295 days in 2008 to pay trade creditors
   is clearly a negative signal. In addition, the company’s inventories disappeared,
   most likely because the company did not have enough cash to purchase new
   inventory and was unable to get additional credit from its suppliers.
       Of course, an analyst would have immediately noted the negative trends
   in these data, as well as additional data throughout the company’s financial
   statements. In its management discussion and analysis (MD&A), the company
   clearly reports the risks as follows:

        Because we have historically had losses and only a limited amount of cash
        has been generated from operations, we have funded our operating activ-
        ities to date primarily from the sale of securities and from the sale of a
        product line in 2009. In order to continue to fund our operations, we may
        need to raise additional capital, through the sale of securities. We cannot
        be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or
        at all. Moreover, additional equity financing, if available, would likely be
        dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available,
        would likely involve restrictive covenants and a security interest in all or
        substantially all of our assets. If we fail to obtain acceptable financing when
        needed, we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations
        which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
            IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE ADEQUATE WORKING
        CAPITAL FROM OPERATIONS OR RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
        THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY
        TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. (emphasis added by company)
       Subsequently, the company’s 2010 Form 10-K reported:

        In January 2011, due to our inability to meet our financial obligations and
        the impending loss of a critical distribution agreement granting us the right
        to distribute certain products, our secured lenders (“Secured Parties”) acting
        upon an event of default, sold certain of our assets (other than cash and
        accounts receivable) to Micronet, Ltd. (“Micronet”), an unaffiliated corpo-
        ration pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement between the
        Secured Parties and Micronet dated January 10, 2010 (the “Asset Purchase
        Agreement”). In order to induce Micronet to enter into the agreement, the
        Company also provided certain representations and warranties regarding
        certain business matters.

                              must not only be calculated but also must be interpreted by an analyst.

            11             SOLVENCY RATIOS

                                           calculate and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitability
                                           ratios

                           Solvency refers to a company’s ability to fulfill its long-term debt obligations.
                           Assessment of a company’s ability to pay its long-term obligations (i.e., to make interest
                           and principal payments) generally includes an in-depth analysis of the components
                           of its financial structure. Solvency ratios, introduced in earlier modules in Corporate
                           Issuers, provide information regarding the relative amount of debt in the company’s
                           capital structure and the adequacy of earnings and cash flow to cover interest expenses
                           and other fixed charges (such as lease payments) as they come due.
                                By analyzing financial statements, an analyst aims to understand levels and trends
                           in a company’s use of financial leverage in relation to past practices and the prac-
                           tices of peer companies. Analysts also need to be aware that the greater a company’s
                           operating leverage, the greater the risk of the operating income stream available to
                           cover debt payments; operating leverage can thus limit a company’s capacity to use
                           financial leverage.
                                A company’s relative solvency is fundamental to valuation of its debt securities and
                           its creditworthiness. Understanding a company’s use of debt can provide analysts with
                           insight into the company’s future business prospects because management’s decisions
                           about financing may signal their beliefs about a company’s future. For example, the
                           issuance of long-term debt to repurchase common shares may indicate that manage-
                           ment believes the market is underestimating the company’s prospects and that the
                           shares are undervalued.


                           Calculation of Solvency Ratios
                           The two primary types of solvency ratios are debt ratios and coverage ratios. Debt
                           ratios focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt capital relative
                           to equity capital. Coverage ratios focus on the income statement and measure the
                           ability of a company to cover its debt payments. These ratios are useful in assessing
                           a company’s solvency and, therefore, in evaluating the quality of a company’s bonds
                           and other debt obligations.
                               Exhibit 25 describes commonly used solvency ratios. The first three of the debt
                           ratios presented use total debt in the numerator. The definition of total debt used in
                           these ratios varies, with some market participants using the sum of interest-bearing
                           short-term and long-term debt, excluding liabilities such as accrued expenses, accounts
                           payable, and leases. (For calculations in this module, we use this definition.) Other
                           market participants use definitions that are more inclusive (e.g., all liabilities) or
                           restrictive (e.g., long-term debt only, in which case the ratio is sometimes qualified

marketable securities could be used to pay debt obligations, so it is only debt in excess
of this amount that must be covered by future operating cash flows. Analysts should
be transparent about their calculation methodologies and closely scrutinize ratios
reported by issuers.

Interpretation of Solvency Ratios
In the following, we discuss the interpretation of the basic solvency ratios presented
in Exhibit 25.

Debt-to-Assets Ratio
This ratio measures the percentage of total assets financed with debt. For example, a
debt-to-assets ratio of 0.40 or 40 percent indicates that 40 percent of the company’s
assets are financed with debt. Generally, higher debt means higher financial risk and
thus weaker solvency.

Debt-to-Capital Ratio
The debt-to-capital ratio measures the percentage of a company’s capital (debt plus
equity) represented by debt. As with the previous ratio, a higher ratio generally means
higher financial risk and thus indicates weaker solvency.

Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The debt-to-equity ratio measures the amount of debt capital relative to equity cap-
ital. Interpretation is similar to the preceding two ratios (i.e., a higher ratio indicates
weaker solvency). A ratio of 1.0 would indicate equal amounts of debt and equity,
which is equivalent to a debt-to-capital ratio of 50 percent. Alternative definitions of
this ratio use the market value of stockholders’ equity rather than its book value (or
use the market values of both stockholders’ equity and debt).

                           Financial Leverage Ratio
                           The financial leverage ratio (often called simply the “leverage ratio”) measures the
                           amount of total assets supported for each one money unit of equity. For example, a
                           value of 3 for this ratio means that each EUR1 of equity supports EUR3 of total assets.
                           The higher the financial leverage ratio, the more leveraged the company is in the sense
                           of using debt and other liabilities to finance assets. This ratio is often defined in terms
                           of average total assets and average total equity.

                           Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio
                           The debt-to-EBITDA ratio estimates how many years it would take to repay total debt
                           based on earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (an approxima-
                           tion of operating cash flow). This ratio is commonly used in debt covenants between
                           issuers and debt investors.

                           Interest Coverage
                           The interest coverage ratio measures the number of times a company’s EBIT could
                           cover its interest payments. Thus, it is sometimes referred to as “times interest earned.”
                           A higher interest coverage ratio indicates stronger solvency, offering greater assurance
                           that the company can service its debt (i.e., bank debt, bonds, notes) from operating
                           earnings. This ratio is commonly used in debt covenants between issuers and lenders
                           or fixed income investors.

                           Fixed Charge Coverage
                           The fixed charge coverage ratio relates fixed charges, or obligations, to the cash flow
                           generated by the company. It measures the number of times a company’s earnings
                           (before interest, taxes, and lease payments) can cover the company’s interest and lease
                           payments. Similar to the interest coverage ratio, a higher fixed charge coverage ratio
                           implies stronger solvency, offering greater assurance that the company can service
                           its debt (i.e., bank debt, bonds, notes, and leases) from normal earnings. The ratio is
                           sometimes used as an indication of the quality of the preferred dividend, with a higher
                           ratio indicating a more secure preferred dividend.
                               Example 11 demonstrates the use of solvency ratios in evaluating the creditwor-
                           thiness of a company.

   1. Calculate the company’s financial leverage ratios for 2016 and 2017.
      Solution:
      (Amounts are millions of Rand.)
      For 2017, average total assets were (710,009 + 663,170)/2 = 686,590, and
      average total equity was (175,942 + 182,352)/2 = 179,147. Thus, financial
      leverage was 686,590/179,942 = 3.83. For 2016, financial leverage was 4.07.
                                              ​

   2. Interpret the financial leverage ratio calculated in question 1.
      Solution:
      For 2017, every South African rand in total equity supported ZAR3.83 in
      total assets, on average. Financial leverage decreased from 2016 to 2017 on
      this measure.

   3. What are the company’s debt-to-assets, debt-to-capital, and debt-to-equity
      ratios for the three years?
      Solution:
      (Amounts are millions of South African rand other than ratios.)

                                              ​




   4. What is the discernable trend over the three years?
      Solution:
      On all three metrics, the company’s leverage decreased from 2015 to 2016
      and increased from 2016 to 2017. For 2016 the decrease in leverage result-
      ed from a conversion of subordinated debt into equity as well as additional
      issuance of equity. However, in 2017 debt levels increased again relative to
      assets, capital, and equity indicating that the company’s solvency has weak-
      ened. From a creditor’s perspective, lower solvency (higher debt) indicates
      higher risk of default on obligations.

    As with all ratio analysis, it is important to consider leverage ratios in a broader
context. In general, companies with lower business risk and operations that generate
steady cash flows are better positioned to take on more leverage without a commen-
surate increase in the risk of insolvency. In other words, a higher proportion of debt
financing poses less risk of non-payment of interest and debt principal to a company
with steady cash flows than to a company with volatile cash flows.

                                            ratios

                           The ability to generate profit on capital invested is a key determinant of a company’s
                           overall value and the value of the securities it issues. Consequently, many equity ana-
                           lysts consider profitability to be a key focus of their analytical efforts.
                               Profitability reflects a company’s competitive position in the market, and by
                           extension, the quality of its management. The income statement reveals the sources
                           of earnings and the components of revenue and expenses. Earnings can be distributed
                           to shareholders or reinvested in the company.


                           Calculation of Profitability Ratios
                           Profitability ratios measure the return earned by the company during a period. Exhibit
                           27 provides the definitions of a selection of commonly used profitability ratios, some
                           of which were introduced in earlier modules in Corporate Issuers. Return-on-sales
                           profitability ratios express various subtotals on the income statement (e.g., gross profit,
                           operating profit, net profit) as a percentage of revenue. Essentially, these ratios consti-
                           tute part of a common-size income statement discussed earlier. Return on investment
                           profitability ratios measure income relative to assets, equity, or total capital employed
                           by the company. For operating ROA, returns are measured as operating income, that
                           is, prior to deducting interest on debt capital. For ROA and ROE, returns are mea-
                           sured as net income, that is, after deducting interest paid on debt capital. For return
                           on common equity, returns are measured as net income minus preferred dividends
                           (because preferred dividends are a return to preferred equity).

Interpretation of Profitability Ratios
In the following, we discuss the interpretation of the profitability ratios presented
in Exhibit 27. For each of the profitability ratios, a higher ratio indicates greater
profitability.

Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin indicates the percentage of revenue available to cover operating
and other expenses and to generate profit. Higher gross profit margin indicates some
combination of higher product pricing and lower product costs. The ability to charge
a higher price is constrained by competition, so gross profits are affected by (and usu-
ally inversely related to) competition. If a product has a competitive advantage (e.g.,
superior branding, better quality, or exclusive technology), the company is better able
to charge more for it. On the cost side, higher gross profit margin can also indicate
that a company has a competitive advantage in product costs.

Operating Profit Margin
Operating profit is calculated as gross profit minus operating costs. So, an operating
profit margin increasing faster than the gross profit margin can indicate improve-
ments in controlling operating costs, such as administrative overheads. In contrast, a
declining operating profit margin could be an indicator of deteriorating control over
operating costs.

Pretax Margin
Pretax income (also called “earnings before tax” or EBT) is calculated as operating profit
minus interest, and the pretax margin is the ratio of pretax income to revenue. The
pretax margin reflects the effects on profitability of leverage and other (non-operating)
income and expenses. If a company’s pretax margin is increasing primarily as a result
of increasing amounts of non-operating income, the analyst should evaluate whether
this increase reflects a deliberate change in a company’s business focus and, therefore,
the likelihood that the increase will continue.

Net Profit Margin
Net profit, or net income, is calculated as revenue minus all expenses. Net income
includes both recurring and non-recurring components. Generally, the net income
used in calculating the net profit margin is adjusted for non-recurring items to offer
a better view of a company’s potential future profitability.

ROA
ROA measures the return earned by a company on its assets. The higher the ratio,
the more income is generated by a given level of assets. Most databases compute this
ratio as follows:
         Net income
    ______________
      
    	​   
       Average total assets ​.

An issue with this computation is that net income is the return to equity holders,
whereas assets are financed by both equity holders and creditors. Interest expense
(the return to creditors) has already been subtracted in the numerator. Some analysts,
428   Learning Module 11                                                                            Financial Analysis Techniques


                           therefore, prefer to add back interest expense in the numerator. In such cases, interest
                           must be adjusted for income taxes because net income is determined after taxes. With
                           this adjustment, the ratio would be computed as follows:
                                 Net income + Interest expense​(1 − Tax rate)​
                              _______________________________
                              	​
                                               
                                            Average total assets             ​.

                           Alternatively, some analysts elect to compute ROA on a pre-interest and pre-tax basis
                           (operating ROA in Exhibit 27) as follows:
                              Operating income or EBIT
                              ___________________
                              	​   
                                 Average total assets ​.

                           In this ROA calculation, returns are measured prior to deducting interest on debt
                           capital (i.e., as operating income or EBIT). This measure reflects the return on all assets
                           invested in the company, whether financed with liabilities, debt, or equity. Whichever
                           form of ROA is chosen, the analyst must use it consistently in comparisons to other
                           companies or time periods.

                           Return on Invested Capital
                           Return on invested capital measures the after-tax profitability a company earns on
                           all of the capital that it employs (short-term debt, long-term debt, and equity). As
                           with operating ROA, returns are measured prior to deducting interest on debt capital
                           (i.e., as operating income or EBIT).

                           ROE
                           ROE measures the return earned by a company on its equity capital, including minority
                           equity, preferred equity, and common equity. As noted, return is measured as net
                           income (i.e., interest on debt capital is not included in the return on equity capital).
                           A variation of ROE is return on common equity, which measures the return earned
                           by a company only on its common equity.
                               Both ROA and ROE are important measures of profitability and will be explored
                           in more detail later. As with other ratios, profitability ratios should be evaluated
                           individually and as a group to gain an understanding of what is driving profitability
                           (operating versus non-operating activities). Example 12 demonstrates the evaluation
                           of profitability ratios and the use of the management report (sometimes called man-
                           agement discussion and analysis or management commentary) that accompanies
                           financial statements to explain the trend in ratios.

                              Recall from Example 1 that an analysis found that Apple’s gross margin declined
                              over the three-year period FY2015 to FY2017. An analyst would like to further
                              explore Apple’s profitability using a five-year period. He gathers the following
                              revenue data and calculates the following profitability ratios from information
                              in Apple’s annual reports, as shown in Exhibit 28:

   1. Evaluate the overall trend in Apple’s profitability ratios for the five-year
      period.
      Solution:
      Sales had increased steadily through 2015, dropped in 2016, and rebounded
      somewhat in 2017. As noted in Example 1, the sales decline in 2016 was
      related to a decline in iPhone sales and weakness in foreign currencies.
      Margins also rose from 2013 to 2015 and declined in 2016. However, in spite
      of the increase in sales in 2017, all margins declined slightly indicating costs
      were rising faster than sales. In spite of the fluctuations, Apple’s bottom line
      net profit margin was relatively stable over the five-year period.



QUESTION SET


   1. Which ratio would a company most likely use to measure its ability
      to meet short-term obligations?
       A. Current ratio
       B. Payables turnover
       C. Gross profit margin
      Solution:
      A is correct. The current ratio is a liquidity ratio. It compares the net
      amount of current assets expected to be converted into cash within the year
      with liabilities falling due in the same period. A current ratio of 1.0 would
      indicate that the company would have just enough current assets to pay
      current liabilities.

   2. Which of the following ratios would be most useful in determining a compa-
      ny’s ability to cover its lease and interest payments?
       A. ROA
       B. Total asset turnover
       C. Fixed charge coverage
      Solution:
      C is correct. The fixed charge coverage ratio is a coverage ratio that relates
      known fixed charges or obligations to a measure of operating profit or cash
      flow generated by the company. Coverage ratios, a category of solvency ra-
      tios, measure the ability of a company to cover its payments related to debt
      and leases.

                              3. Assuming no changes in other variables, which of the following would de-
                                 crease ROA?
                                  A. An increase in average assets
                                  B. A decrease in interest expense
                                  C. A decrease in the effective tax rate
                                 Solution:
                                 A is correct. Assuming no changes in other variables, an increase in average
                                 assets (an increase in the denominator) would decrease ROA. A decrease
                                 in either the effective tax rate or interest expense, assuming no changes in
                                 other variables, would increase ROA.

                                          ratio analysis

                           In prior lessons, the text presented separately activity, liquidity, solvency, and profitabil-
                           ity ratios. Before discussing valuation ratios, this lesson demonstrates the importance
                           of examining a variety of financial ratios—not a single ratio or category of ratios in
                           isolation—to ascertain the overall position and performance of a company. Experience
                           shows that the information from one ratio category can be helpful in answering ques-
                           tions raised by another category and that the most accurate overall picture comes
                           from integrating information from all sources.


                           The Overall Ratio Picture: Examples
                           We present two simple examples to introduce the use of a variety of ratios to address
                           an analytical task. Example 13 shows how the analysis of a pair of activity ratios
                           resolves an issue concerning a company’s liquidity. Example 14 shows that examining
                           the overall ratios of multiple companies can assist an analyst in drawing conclusions
                           about their relative performances.

       The ratios present a contradictory picture of the company’s liquidity. Based
   on the increase in its current ratio from 1.6 to 2.1, the company appears to have
   strong and improving liquidity; however, based on the decline of the quick ratio
   from 1.0 to 0.8, its liquidity appears to be deteriorating. Because both ratios
   have exactly the same denominator, current liabilities, the difference must be
   the result of changes in some asset that is included in the current ratio but not
   in the quick ratio (e.g., inventories). The analyst collects the activity ratios in
   Exhibit 30:
                                             ​




       Exhibit 30: Activity Ratios
                                             ​




                                             ​




    DOH                    55                    45                30
    DSO                    24                    28                30
                                             ​




       The company’s DOH has deteriorated from 30 days to 55 days, meaning
   that the company is holding increasingly larger amounts of inventory relative
   to sales. The decrease in DSO implies that the company is collecting receivables
   faster. If the proceeds from these collections were held as cash, there would be
   no effect on either the current ratio or the quick ratio. However, if the proceeds
   from the collections were used to purchase inventory, there would be no effect
   on the current ratio and a decline in the quick ratio (i.e., the pattern shown in
   this example). Collectively, the ratios suggest that liquidity is declining and that
   the company may have an inventory problem that needs to be addressed.

                            1. Which of the following choices best describes reasonable conclusions an
                               analyst might make about the companies’ efficiency?
                                A. In FY5, Anson’s DOH of only 4.76 indicated that it was less efficient at
                                   inventory management than Clarence, which had DOH of 39.73.
                                B. Over the past four years, Anson has shown greater improvement in
                                   efficiency than Clarence, as indicated by its total asset turnover ratio
                                   increasing from 0.84 to 1.11.
                                C. In FY5, Clarence’s receivables turnover of 8.35 times indicated that it
                                   was more efficient at receivables management than Anson, which had
                                   receivables turnover of 10.75.
                               Solution:
                               B is correct. Over the past four years, Anson has shown greater improve-
                               ment in efficiency than Clarence, as indicated by its total asset turnover
                               ratio increasing from 0.84 to 1.11. Over the same period of time, Clarence’s
                               total asset turnover ratio has declined from 1.38 to 1.06. Choices B and C
                               are incorrect because DOH and receivables turnover are misinterpreted.

DuPont Analysis—The Decomposition of ROE                                                   433


As noted earlier, ROE measures the return a company generates on its equity capital.
To understand what drives a company’s ROE, a useful technique is to decompose ROE
into its component parts. (Decomposition of ROE is sometimes referred to as DuPont
analysis because it was developed originally at that company.) Decomposing ROE
involves expressing the basic ratio (i.e., net income divided by average shareholders’
equity) as the product of component ratios. Because each of these component ratios
is an indicator of a distinct aspect of a company’s performance that affects ROE,
the decomposition allows us to evaluate how these different aspects of performance
affected the company’s profitability as measured by ROE.
    Decomposing ROE is useful in determining the reasons for changes in ROE over
time for a given company and for differences in ROE for different companies in a given
time period. The information gained can also be used by management to determine
which areas they should focus on to improve ROE. This decomposition will also show
why a company’s overall profitability, measured by ROE, is a function of its efficiency,
operating profitability, taxes, and use of financial leverage. DuPont analysis shows the
relationship between the various categories of ratios discussed in this module and
how they all influence the return to the investment of the owners.
    Analysts have developed several different methods of decomposing ROE. The
decomposition presented here is one of the most commonly used and the one found
in popular research databases, such as Bloomberg. Return on equity is calculated as
follows:
   ROE = Net income/Average shareholders’ equity.
The decomposition of ROE makes use of simple algebra and illustrates the relationship
between ROE and ROA. Expressing ROE as a product of only two of its components,
we can write:
                        Net income
   ROE = ____________________
                
                 
              ​Average  shareholders' equity ​
   	​
                                             ​ assets
                                    Average total            ​	                   (1)
          Net income
      ______________           ____________________
   =   
      ​  
       Average total assets ​×   
                               ​Average
                                        shareholders' equity ​

which can be interpreted as follows:
   ROE = ROA × Leverage.
In other words, ROE is a function of a company’s ROA and its use of financial lever-
age (“leverage” for short, in this discussion). A company can improve its ROE by
improving ROA or by increasing leverage. Consistent with the definition given earlier,
leverage is measured as average total assets divided by average shareholders’ equity. If
a company had no leverage (no liabilities), its leverage ratio would equal 1.0 and ROE
would exactly equal ROA. As a company takes on liabilities, its leverage increases. As
long as a company is able to borrow at a rate lower than the marginal rate it can earn
investing the borrowed money, the company is making an effective use of leverage and
ROE would increase as leverage increases. If a company’s borrowing cost exceeds the
marginal rate it can earn on investing in the business, ROE would decline as leverage
increased because the effect of borrowing would be to depress ROA.
    Using the data from Example 14 for Anson Industries, an analyst can examine the
trend in ROE and determine whether the increase from an ROE of –0.625 percent in
FY2 to 5.925 percent in FY5 is a function of ROA or the use of leverage:

                           FY2                       –0.62%                        –0.39%                          1.60

                           Over the four-year period, the company’s leverage factor was relatively stable. The pri-
                           mary reason for the increase in ROE is the increase in profitability measured by ROA.
                              Just as ROE can be decomposed, the individual components such as ROA can be
                           decomposed. Further decomposing ROA, we can express ROE as a product of three
                           component ratios:
                                        Net income

                                  ____________________

                                  ​Average
                                           shareholders' equity ​

                              which can be interpreted as follows:
                              ROE = Net profit margin × Total asset turnover × Leverage.
                           The first term on the right-hand side of this equation is the net profit margin, an indi-
                           cator of profitability: how much income a company derives per one monetary unit (e.g.,
                           euro or US dollar) of sales. The second term on the right is the asset turnover ratio,
                           an indicator of efficiency: how much revenue a company generates per one money
                           unit of assets. Note that ROA is decomposed into these two components: net profit
                           margin and total asset turnover. A company’s ROA is a function of profitability (net
                           profit margin) and efficiency (total asset turnover). The third term on the right-hand
                           side of the equation is a measure of financial leverage, an indicator of solvency: the
                           total amount of a company’s assets relative to its equity capital. This decomposition
                           illustrates that a company’s ROE is a function of its net profit margin, its efficiency,
                           and its leverage. Again, using the data from Example 14 for Anson Industries, the
                           analyst can evaluate in more detail the reasons behind the trend in ROE:



                             Exhibit 33: Anson Industries

                                                               Net profit               Total asset

                           FY5          5.92%                    3.33%                      1.11                      1.60
                           FY4          1.66%                    1.11%                      0.95                      1.58
                           FY3          1.62%                    1.13%                      0.93                      1.54
                           FY2         –0.62%                   –0.47%                      0.84                      1.60

                           This further decomposition confirms that increases in profitability (measured here as
                           net profit margin) are indeed an important contributor to the increase in ROE over
                           the four-year period. However, Anson’s asset turnover has also increased steadily.
                           The increase in ROE is, therefore, a function of improving profitability and improving
                           efficiency. As noted earlier, ROE decomposition can also be used to compare the ROEs
                           of peer companies, as demonstrated in Example 15.

EXAMPLE 15

   A Comparison of Two Companies (2)

   1. Referring to the data for Anson Industries and Clarence Corporation in Ex-
      ample 14, which of the following choices best describes reasonable conclu-
      sions an analyst might make about the companies’ ROE?
      A. Anson’s inventory turnover of 76.69 indicates it is more profitable than
         Clarence.
      B. The main driver of Clarence’s superior ROE in FY5 is its more efficient
         use of assets.
       C. The main drivers of Clarence’s superior ROE in FY5 are its greater use
          of debt financing and higher net profit margin.
      Solution:
      C is correct. The main driver of Clarence’s superior ROE (9.28 percent
      compared with only 5.92 percent for Anson) in FY5 is its greater use of debt
      financing (leverage of 2.00 compared with Anson’s leverage of 1.60) and
      higher net profit margin (4.38 percent compared with only 3.33 percent for
      Anson).
      A is incorrect because inventory turnover is not a direct indicator of prof-
      itability. An increase in inventory turnover may indicate more efficient use
      of inventory which in turn could affect profitability; however, an increase in
      inventory turnover would also be observed if a company was selling more
      goods even if it was not selling those goods at a profit. B is incorrect because
      Clarence has less efficient use of assets than Anson, indicated by turnover of
      1.06 for Clarence compared with Anson’s turnover of 1.11.

   To separate the effects of taxes and interest, we can further decompose the net
profit margin and write:
           Net income
  ____________________              Net income _
                                    _              EBT _    EBIT
       
  ​Average shareholders' equity ​ = ​ EBT ​× ​EBIT ​× ​Revenue ​
  	​
                                   Average total assets          ​	 ​                (3)
             Revenue
     × ______________
       ​                    ​ × ____________________
                                  
                                ​
                                  
        Average total assets Average shareholders' equity ​

   which can be interpreted as follows:
   ROE = Tax burden × Interest burden × EBIT margin × Total asset turnover ×
   Leverage.
This five-way decomposition is the one found in financial databases such as Bloomberg.
The first term on the right-hand side of this equation measures the effect of taxes on
ROE. Essentially, it reflects one minus the average tax rate, or how much of a com-
pany’s pretax profits it gets to keep. This can be expressed in decimal or percentage
form. So, a 30 percent tax rate would yield a factor of 0.70 or 70 percent. A higher
value for the tax burden implies that the company can keep a higher percentage of its
pretax profits, indicating a lower tax rate. A decrease in the tax burden ratio implies
the opposite (i.e., a higher tax rate leaving the company with less of its pretax profits).
    The second term on the right-hand side captures the effect of interest on ROE.
Higher borrowing costs reduce ROE. Some analysts prefer to use operating income
instead of EBIT for this term and the following term. Either operating income or
EBIT is acceptable as long as it is applied consistently. In such a case, the second term
would measure both the effect of interest expense and non-operating income on ROE.
    The third term on the right-hand side captures the effect of operating margin (if
operating income is used in the numerator) or EBIT margin (if EBIT is used) on ROE.
In either case, this term primarily measures the effect of operating profitability on ROE.

                               The fourth term on the right-hand side is again the total asset turnover ratio, an
                           indicator of the overall efficiency of the company (i.e., how much revenue it generates
                           per unit of total assets). The fifth term on the right-hand side is the financial leverage
                           ratio described above—the total amount of a company’s assets relative to its equity
                           capital.
                               This decomposition expresses a company’s ROE as a function of its tax rate, interest
                           burden, operating profitability, efficiency, and leverage. An analyst can use this frame-
                           work to determine what factors are driving a company’s ROE. The decomposition of
                           ROE can also be useful in forecasting ROE based upon expected efficiency, profitability,
                           financing activities, and tax rates. The relationship of the individual factors, such as
                           ROA to the overall ROE, can also be expressed in the form of an ROE tree to study the
                           contribution of each of the five factors, as shown in Exhibit 34 for Anson Industries.
                               Exhibit 34 shows that Anson’s ROE of 5.92 percent in FY5 can be decomposed
                           into ROA of 3.70 percent and leverage of 1.60. ROA can further be decomposed into
                           a net profit margin of 3.33 percent and total asset turnover of 1.11. Net profit margin
                           can be decomposed into a tax burden of 0.70 (an average tax rate of 30 percent), an
                           interest burden of 0.90, and an EBIT margin of 5.29 percent. Overall ROE is decom-
                           posed into five components.

  stand the factors driving the trend in ROE over a four-year period. The analyst

  1. What might the analyst conclude?
     Solution:
     The tax burden measure has varied, with no obvious trend. In the most
     recent year, 2017, taxes declined as a percentage of pretax profit. (Because
     the tax burden reflects the relation of after-tax profits to pretax profits, the
     increase from 52.10 percent in 2016 to 60.50 percent in 2017 indicates that
     taxes declined as a percentage of pretax profits.) This decline in average tax
     rates could be a result of lower tax rates from new legislation or revenue in a
     lower tax jurisdiction. The interest burden has remained fairly constant over
     the four-year period indicating that the company maintains a fairly constant
     capital structure. Operating margin (EBIT margin) declined over the period,
     indicating the company’s operations were less profitable. This decline is gen-
     erally consistent with declines in oil prices in 2017 and declines in refining
     industry gross margins in 2016 and 2017. The company’s efficiency (asset
     turnover) decreased in 2017. The company’s leverage remained constant,
     consistent with the constant interest burden. Overall, the trend in ROE
     (declining substantially over the recent years) resulted from decreases in op-
     erating profits and a lower asset turnover. Additional research on the causes
     of these changes is required to develop expectations about the company’s
     future performance.

    The most detailed decomposition of ROE that we have presented is a five-way
decomposition. Nevertheless, an analyst could further decompose individual com-
ponents of a five-way analysis. For example, EBIT margin (EBIT/Revenue) could be
further decomposed into a non-operating component (EBIT/Operating income) and
an operating component (Operating income/Revenue). The analyst can also examine
which other factors contributed to these five components. For example, an improve-
ment in efficiency (total asset turnover) may have resulted from better management
of inventory (DOH) or better collection of receivables (DSO).

                    15                  INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC FINANCIAL RATIOS

                                                      describe the uses of industry-specific ratios used in financial analysis

                                        As stated earlier, a universally accepted definition and classification of ratios does not
                                        exist. The purpose of ratios is to serve as indicators of important aspects of a compa-
                                        ny’s performance and value. Aspects of performance that are considered important
                                        in one industry may be irrelevant in another, and industry-specific ratios reflect these
                                        differences. For example, companies in the retail industry may report same-store sales
                                        changes because, in the retail industry, it is important to distinguish between growth
                                        that results from opening new stores and growth that results from generating more
                                        sales at existing stores. Industry-specific metrics can be especially important to the
                                        value of equity in early-stage industries, where companies are not yet profitable.
                                            In addition, regulated industries—especially in the financial sector—often are
                                        required to comply with specific regulatory ratios. For example, the banking sector’s
                                        liquidity and cash reserve ratios provide an indication of banking liquidity and reflect
                                        monetary and regulatory requirements. Banking capital adequacy requirements attempt
                                        to relate banks’ solvency requirements directly to their specific levels of risk exposure.

MODEL BUILDING AND FORECASTING
                                                                                                                16
                describe how ratio analysis and other techniques can be used to
                model and forecast earnings

Analysts often need to forecast future financial performance. For example, analysts’
EPS forecasts and related equity valuations are widely followed by Wall Street. Analysts
use data about the economy, industry, and company in arriving at a company’s forecast.
The results of an analyst’s financial analysis, including common-size and ratio analyses,
are integral to this process, along with the judgment of the analysts.
    Based upon forecasts of growth and expected relationships among the financial
statement data, the analyst can build a model to forecast future performance, which
will be covered in later modules. In addition to budgets, pro forma financial statements
are widely used in financial forecasting within companies, especially for use by senior
executives and boards of directors. Last but not least, these budgets and forecasts are
also used in presentations to credit analysts and others in obtaining external financing.

                               For example, based on a revenue forecast, an analyst may budget expenses based
                           on expected common-size data. Forecasts of balance sheet and cash flow statements
                           can be derived from expected ratio data, such as DSO. Forecasts are not limited to
                           a single point estimate but should involve a range of possibilities. This can involve
                           several techniques:
                              ■   Sensitivity analysis: Also known as “what if ” analysis, sensitivity analysis
                                  shows the range of possible outcomes as specific assumptions are changed;
                                  this could, in turn, influence financing needs or investment in fixed assets.
                              ■   Scenario analysis: This type of analysis shows the changes in key finan-
                                  cial quantities that result from given (economic) events, such as the loss of
                                  customers, the loss of a supply source, or a catastrophic event. If the list of
                                  events is mutually exclusive and exhaustive and the events can be assigned
                                  probabilities, the analyst can evaluate not only the range of outcomes but
                                  also standard statistical measures such as the mean and median value for
                                  various quantities of interest.
                              ■   Simulation: This is computer-generated sensitivity or scenario analysis
                                  based on probability models for the factors that drive outcomes. Each event
                                  or possible outcome is assigned a probability. Multiple scenarios are then
                                  run using the probability factors assigned to the possible values of a variable
                                  to determine an expected outcome for that variable.

                              PRACTICE PROBLEMS
                           1. Comparison of a company’s financial results to other peer companies for the
                              same time period is called:
                              A. time-series analysis.

                              B. common-size analysis.

                              C. cross-sectional analysis.

                           2. An analyst observes a decrease in a company’s inventory turnover. Which of the
                              following would most likely explain this trend?
                              A. The company installed a new inventory management system, allowing more
                                 efficient inventory management.

                              B. Due to problems with obsolescent inventory last year, the company wrote
                                 off a large amount of its inventory at the beginning of the period.

                              C. The company installed a new inventory management system but expe-
                                 rienced some operational difficulties resulting in duplicate orders being
                                 placed with suppliers.

                           3. Which of the following would best explain an increase in receivables turnover?
                              A. The company adopted new credit policies last year and began offering credit
                                 to customers with weak credit histories.

                              B. Due to problems with an error in its old credit scoring system, the company
                                 had accumulated a substantial amount of uncollectible accounts and wrote
                                 off a large amount of its receivables.

                              C. To match the terms offered by its closest competitor, the company adopted
                                 new payment terms now requiring net payment within 30 days rather than
                                 15 days, which had been its previous requirement.

                           4. Brown Corporation had average days of sales outstanding of 19 days in the most
                              recent fiscal year. Brown wants to improve its credit policies and collection
                              practices and decrease its collection period in the next fiscal year to match the
                              industry average of 15 days. Credit sales in the most recent fiscal year were $300
                              million, and Brown expects credit sales to increase to $390 million in the next fis-
                              cal year. To achieve Brown’s goal of decreasing the collection period, the change
                              in the average accounts receivable balance that must occur is closest to:
                              A. +USD0.41 million.

                              B. –USD0.41 million.

                              C. –USD1.22 million.
Practice Problems                                                                         443



The following information relates to questions
5-5
   An analyst is interested in assessing both the efficiency and liquidity of Spherion
   PLC. The analyst has collected the data in Exhibit 1 for Spherion:



  Exhibit 1: Spherion Data

                                                       FY3         FY2             FY1

Days of inventory on hand                               32          34             40
Days sales outstanding                                  28          25             23
Number of days of payables                              40          35             35


5. Based on the data in Exhibit 1, what is the analyst least likely to conclude?
   A. Inventory management has contributed to improved liquidity.

   B. Management of payables has contributed to improved liquidity.

   C. Management of receivables has contributed to improved liquidity.

6. To assess a company’s ability to fulfill its long-term obligations, an analyst would
   most likely examine:
   A. activity ratios.

   B. liquidity ratios.

   C. solvency ratios.



The following information relates to questions
7-8
   An analyst is evaluating the solvency and liquidity of Apex Manufacturing and
   has collected the data in Exhibit 1:



  Exhibit 1: Solvency and Liquidity of Apex Manufacturing (euro millions)

                               FY5                   FY4                   FY3

Total debt                    2,000                 1,900                  1,750
Total equity                  4,000                 4,500                  5,000


7. Which of the following would be the analyst’s most likely conclusion?
   A. The company is becoming less liquid, as evidenced by the increase in its
      debt-to-equity ratio from 0.35 to 0.50 from FY3 to FY5.
444   Learning Module 11                                                             Financial Analysis Techniques


                               B. The company is becoming increasingly more liquid, as evidenced by the
                                  increase in its debt-to-equity ratio from 0.35 to 0.50 from FY3 to FY5.

                               C. The company is becoming increasingly less solvent, as evidenced by the
                                  increase in its debt-to-equity ratio from 0.35 to 0.50 from FY3 to FY5.

                           8. What would be the most reasonable explanation of the financial data?
                               A. The decline in the company’s equity results from a decline in the market
                                  value of this company’s common shares.

                               B. The EUR250 increase in the company’s debt from FY3 to FY5 indicates that
                                  lenders are viewing the company as increasingly creditworthy.

                               C. The decline in the company’s equity indicates that the company may be
                                  incurring losses, paying dividends greater than income, or repurchasing
                                  shares.


                           9. An analyst observes the data in Exhibit 1 for two companies:

                           Revenue                                 4,500                        6,000
                           Net income                               50                          1,000
                           Current assets                         40,000                        60,000
                           Total assets                           100,000                      700,000
                           Current liabilities                    10,000                        50,000
                           Total debt                             60,000                       150,000
                           Shareholders’ equity                   30,000                       500,000

                               Which of the following choices best describes reasonable conclusions that the
                               analyst might make about the two companies’ ability to pay their current and
                               long-term obligations?
                               A. Company A’s current ratio of 4.0 indicates it is more liquid than Company B,
                                  whose current ratio is only 1.2, but Company B is more solvent, as indicated
                                  by its lower debt-to-equity ratio.

                               B. Company A’s current ratio of 0.25 indicates it is less liquid than Company B,
                                  whose current ratio is 0.83, and Company A is also less solvent, as indi-
                                  cated by a debt-to-equity ratio of 200 percent compared with Company B’s
                                  debt-to-equity ratio of only 30 percent.

                               C. Company A’s current ratio of 4.0 indicates it is more liquid than Company
                                  B, whose current ratio is only 1.2, and Company A is also more solvent, as
                                  indicated by a debt-to-equity ratio of 200 percent compared with Company
                                  B’s debt-to-equity ratio of only 30 percent.

                               about the company’s efficiency?
                              A. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s efficiency deteriorated, as indi-
                                 cated by its current ratio.

                              B. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s efficiency deteriorated due to
                                 asset growth faster than turnover revenue growth.

                              C. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s efficiency improved, as indi-

                                 by the growth in its profits to GBP 645 million.

                              B. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s solvency deteriorated, as indi-
                                 cated by a decrease in interest coverage from 10.6 to 8.4.

                              C. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s solvency improved, as indicated
                                 by an increase in its debt-to-assets ratio from 0.14 to 0.27.

                              C. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s profitability deteriorated, as
                                 indicated by a decrease in its net profit margin from 11.0 percent to 5.7
                                 percent.

14. An analyst compiles the data in Exhibit 1 for a company:



           Exhibit 1: Net Profit Margin

                                                 FY13   FY14              FY15

         Total asset turnover                    2.0       2.0             2.1

   Based only on the information above, the most appropriate conclusion is that,
   over the period FY13 to FY15, the company’s:
   A. net profit margin and financial leverage have decreased.

   B. net profit margin and financial leverage have increased.

   C. net profit margin has decreased but its financial leverage has increased.

   Which of the following choices best describes reasonable conclusions an analyst
   might make based on this ROE decomposition?
   A. Profitability and the liquidity position both improved in FY12.

   B. The higher average tax rate in FY12 offset the improvement in profitability,
      leaving ROE unchanged.

   C. The higher average tax rate in FY12 offset the improvement in efficiency,
      leaving ROE unchanged.

                              An analyst is most likely to conclude that:
                              A. Company A’s ROE is higher than Company B’s in FY15, and one explanation
                                 consistent with the data is that Company A may have purchased new, more
                                 efficient equipment.

                              B. the difference between the two companies’ ROE in FY15 is very small and
                                 Company A’s ROE remains similar to Company B’s ROE mainly due to
                                 Company A increasing its financial leverage.

                              C. Company A’s ROE is higher than Company B’s in FY15, and one explanation
                                 consistent with the data is that Company A has made a strategic shift to a
                                 product mix with higher profit margins.

                           17. When developing forecasts, analysts should most likely:
                              A. develop possibilities relying exclusively on the results of financial analysis.

                              B. aim to develop extremely precise forecasts using the results of financial
                                 analysis.

                              C. use the results of financial analysis, analysis of other information, and
                                 judgment.

   SOLUTIONS
1. C is correct. Cross-sectional analysis involves the comparison of companies with
   each other for the same time period. Time-series or trend analysis is the com-
   parison of financial data across different time periods. Common-size analysis
   involves expressing financial data in relation to a single financial statement item,
   or base.

2. C is correct. The company’s problems with its inventory management system
   causing duplicate orders would likely result in a higher amount of inventory
   and, therefore, would result in a decrease in inventory turnover. A more efficient
   inventory management system and a write-off of inventory at the beginning of
   the period would both likely decrease the average inventory for the period (the
   denominator of the inventory turnover ratio), thus increasing the ratio rather
   than decreasing it.

3. B is correct. A write-off of receivables would decrease the average amount of
   accounts receivable (the denominator of the receivables turnover ratio), thus
   increasing this ratio. Customers with weaker credit are more likely to make
   payments more slowly or to pose collection difficulties, which would likely in-
   crease the average amount of accounts receivable and thus decrease receivables
   turnover. Longer payment terms would likely increase the average amount of
   accounts receivable and thus decrease receivables turnover.

4. A is correct. The average accounts receivable balances (actual and desired) must
   be calculated to determine the desired change. The average accounts receivable
   balance can be calculated as an average day’s credit sales times the DSO. For
   the most recent fiscal year, the average accounts receivable balance is USD15.62
   million [= (USD300,000,000/365) × 19]. The desired average accounts receivable
   balance for the next fiscal year is USD16.03 million (= (USD390,000,000/365) ×
   15). This is an increase of USD0.41 million (= 16.03 million – 15.62 million). An
   alternative approach is to calculate the turnover and divide sales by turnover to
   determine the average accounts receivable balance. Turnover equals 365 divided
   by DSO. Turnover is 19.21 (= 365/19) for the most recent fiscal year and is target-
   ed to be 24.33 (= 365/15) for the next fiscal year. The average accounts receivable
   balances are USD15.62 million (= USD300,000,000/19.21), and USD16.03 million
   (= USD390,000,000/24.33). The change is an increase in receivables of USD0.41
   million

5. C is correct. The analyst is unlikely to reach the conclusion given in Statement
   C because days of sales outstanding increased from 23 days in FY1 to 25 days in
   FY2 to 28 days in FY3, indicating that the time required to collect receivables
   has increased over the period. This is a negative factor for Spherion’s liquidity. By
   contrast, days of inventory on hand dropped over the period FY1 to FY3, a posi-
   tive for liquidity. The company’s increase in days payable, from 35 days to 40 days,
   shortened its cash conversion cycle, thus also contributing to improved liquidity.

6. C is correct. Solvency ratios are used to evaluate the ability of a company to
   meet its long-term obligations. An analyst is more likely to use activity ratios to
   evaluate how efficiently a company uses its assets. An analyst is more likely to
   use liquidity ratios to evaluate the ability of a company to meet its short-term
   obligations.

7. C is correct. The company is becoming increasingly less solvent, as evidenced
   by its debt-to-equity ratio increasing from 0.35 to 0.50 from FY3 to FY5. The
450   Learning Module 11                                                                  Financial Analysis Techniques


                              amount of a company’s debt and equity do not provide direct information about
                              the company’s liquidity position.
                              Debt to equity:
                              FY5: 2,000/4,000 = 0.5000

                              FY4: 1,900/4,500 = 0.4222

                              FY3: 1,750/5,000 = 0.3500

                           8. C is correct. The decline in the company’s equity indicates that the company
                              may be incurring losses, paying dividends greater than income, or repurchasing
                              shares. Recall that Beginning equity – Shares repurchased + Comprehensive
                              income – Dividends = Ending equity. The book value of a company’s equity is
                              not affected by changes in the market value of its common stock. An increased
                              amount of lending does not necessarily indicate that lenders view a company as
                              increasingly creditworthy. Creditworthiness is not evaluated based on how much
                              a company has increased its debt but rather on its willingness and ability to pay
                              its obligations. (Its financial strength is indicated by its solvency, liquidity, profit-
                              ability, efficiency, and other aspects of credit analysis.)

                           9. A is correct. Company A’s current ratio of 4.0 (= USD40,000/USD10,000)
                              indicates it is more liquid than Company B, whose current ratio is only 1.2
                              (=USD60,000/USD50,000). Company B is more solvent, as indicated by its lower
                              debt-to-equity ratio of 30 percent (= USD150,000/USD500,000) compared with
                              Company A’s debt-to-equity ratio of 200 percent (= USD60,000/USD30,000).

                           10. B is correct. The company’s efficiency deteriorated, as indicated by the decline
                               in its total asset turnover ratio from 1.11 {= 4,390/[(4,384 + 3,500)/2]} for FY10
                               to 0.87 {= 11,366/[(12,250 + 13,799)/2]} for FY14. The decline in the total asset
                               turnover ratio resulted from an increase in average total assets from GBP3,942 [=
                               (4,384 + 3,500)/2] for FY10 to GBP13,024.5 for FY14, an increase of 230 percent,
                               compared with an increase in revenue from GBP4,390 in FY10 to GBP11,366 in
                               FY14, an increase of only 159 percent. The current ratio is not an indicator of
                               efficiency.

                           11. B is correct. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s solvency deteriorated, as
                               indicated by a decrease in interest coverage from 10.6 (= 844/80) in FY10 to 8.4
                               (= 1,579/188) in FY14. The debt-to-asset ratio increased from 0.14 (= 602/4,384)
                               in FY10 to 0.27 (= 3,707/13,799) in FY14. This is also indicative of deteriorating
                               solvency. In isolation, the amount of profits does not provide enough information
                               to assess solvency.

                           12. A is correct. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s liquidity improved, as
                               indicated by an increase in its current ratio from 0.71 [= (316 + 558)/1,223] in
                               FY10 to 0.75 [= (682 + 1,634)/3,108] in FY14. Note, however, comparing only the
                               cash ratio shows a decline in liquidity from 0.26 (= 316/1,223) in FY10 to 0.22 (=
                               682/3,108) in FY14. Debt-to-assets ratio and interest coverage are measures of
                               solvency not liquidity.

                           13. C is correct. Comparing FY14 with FY10, the company’s profitability deterio-
                               rated, as indicated by a decrease in its net profit margin from 11.0 percent (=
                               484/4,390) to 5.7 percent (= 645/11,366). Debt-to-assets ratio is a measure of
                               solvency not an indicator of profitability. Growth in shareholders’ equity, in isola-
                               tion, does not provide enough information to assess profitability.

                           14. C is correct. The company’s net profit margin has decreased and its financial
Solutions                                                                                451


   leverage has increased. ROA = Net profit margin × Total asset turnover. ROA
   decreased over the period despite the increase in total asset turnover; therefore,
   the net profit margin must have decreased.
   ROE = Return on assets × Financial leverage. ROE increased over the period
   despite the drop in ROA; therefore, financial leverage must have increased.

15. C is correct. The increase in the average tax rate in FY12, as indicated by the
    decrease in the value of the tax burden (the tax burden equals one minus the
    average tax rate), offset the improvement in efficiency indicated by higher asset
    turnover) leaving ROE unchanged. The EBIT margin, measuring profitability, was
    unchanged in FY12 and no information is given on liquidity.

16. B is correct. The difference between the two companies’ ROE in FY15 is very
    small and is mainly the result of Company A’s increase in its financial leverage,
    indicated by the increase in its Assets/Equity ratio from 2 to 4. The impact of
    efficiency on ROE is identical for the two companies, as indicated by both com-
    panies’ asset turnover ratios of 1.5. Furthermore, if Company A had purchased
    newer equipment to replace older, depreciated equipment, then the company’s
    asset turnover ratio (computed as sales/assets) would have declined, assuming
    constant sales. Company A has experienced a significant decline in its operating
    margin, from 10 percent to 7 percent which, all else equal, would not suggest that
    it is selling more products with higher profit margins.

17. C is correct. The results of an analyst’s financial analysis are integral to the
    process of developing forecasts, along with the analysis of other information and
    judgment of the analysts. Forecasts are not limited to a single point estimate but
    should involve a range of possibilities.

              1            INTRODUCTION
                           Financial statement modeling is a key step in the process of valuing companies and the
                           securities they have issued. We begin our discussion with an overview of developing
                           a revenue forecast. We then describe the general approach to forecasting each of the
                           financial statements and demonstrate the construction of a financial statement model,
                           including forecasted income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows.
                           Then, we describe key behavioral biases that can influence the modeling process and
                           strategies to mitigate them. We then turn to several important topics on the effects
                           of micro- and macroeconomic conditions on financial statement models: the impact
                           of competitive factors on prices and costs, the effects of inflation and deflation, tech-
                           nological developments, and long-term forecasting considerations.

                           as a Microsoft Excel workbook. Each worksheet in the workbook is labeled with the

                              LEARNING MODULE OVERVIEW

                                  ■   A financial statement model is the starting point for most valu-
                                      ation models, and valuation estimates can be made based on a
                                      variety of metrics, including free cash flow, EPS, EBITDA, and EBIT.
                                  ■   Some balance sheet line items, such as retained earnings, flow directly
                                      from the income statement, whereas accounts receivable, accounts
                                      payable, and inventory are very closely linked to income statement
                                      projections.
                                  ■   Working capital accounts are modeled by projecting working capital
                                      ratios (e.g., days of inventory, days sales outstanding, days payable out-
                                      standing) which are combined with the sales and cost of sales forecast
                                      to produce projected working capital accounts on the balance sheet.
                                  ■   Five key behavioral biases that influence analyst forecasts are over-
                                      confidence, illusion of control, conservatism, representativeness, and
                                      confirmation bias.
                                  ■   Illusion of control, a bias linked to overconfidence, is a tendency to
                                      overestimate the ability to control what cannot be controlled and to
                                      take ultimately fruitless actions in pursuit of control.
                                  ■   A common manifestation of confirmation bias among investment
                                      analysts is to structure the research process in pursuit of only positive
                                      news or certain criteria, or with a narrow scope.
                                  ■   Competitive factors affect a company’s ability to negotiate lower input
                                      prices with suppliers and to raise prices for products and services.
                                      Porter’s five forces framework can be used as a basis for identifying
                                      such factors.
                                  ■   Porter’s five forces are Threat of substitutes, Rivalry, Bargaining power
                                      of suppliers, Bargaining power of buyers, and Threat of new entrants.
                                  ■   Return on invested capital, ROIC, defined as net operating profit less
                                      adjusted taxes divided by the difference between operating assets and
                                      operating liabilities, is an after-tax measure of profitability. High and
                                      persistent levels of ROIC are often associated with having a competi-
                                      tive advantage.
                                  ■   Inflation and deflation can significantly affect the accuracy of forecasts
                                      for a company’s future revenue, profit, and cash flow.
Building a Financial Statement Model                                                         455


      ■   Forecasting revenue for a company faced with inflation in input costs
          requires an understanding of the price elasticity of the products, the
          different rates of cost inflation in the countries where the company is
          active, and the likely inflation in costs relevant to a company’s individ-
          ual product categories.
      ■   Faced with rising input prices, a company might decide to preserve its
          margins by passing on the costs to its customers, or it might decide to
          accept some margin reduction to increase its market share.
      ■   The choice of the forecast time horizon can be influenced by certain
          factors, including the investment strategy for which the security is
          being considered, the cyclicality of the industry, company-specific
          factors, and the analyst’s employer’s preferences.
      ■   Normalized earnings are the expected level of mid-cycle earnings for
          a company in the absence of any unusual or temporary factors that
          affect profitability.
      ■   One of the greatest challenges facing the analyst is anticipating
          inflection points, such as from economic disruption, regulation, and
          technology, when the future will look significantly different from the
          recent past.




BUILDING A FINANCIAL STATEMENT MODEL
                                                                                         2
              demonstrate the development of a sales-based pro forma company
              model

In this module, we apply the principles covered in earlier modules in Financial
Statement Analysis and Corporate Issuers in a demonstration of building a financial
statement model. The subject company is the Rémy Cointreau Group (Rémy), a French
company that primarily sells spirits. After providing a brief overview of the company,
we will focus primarily on the mechanics of constructing pro forma income state-
ments, statements of cash flows, and balance sheets. Data sources for this example
include the company’s fiscal year ended 31 March 2021 and 2020 annual reports, the
company’s interim reports, and corresponding investor presentations for additional
information on the underlying results of the respective divisions. While forecasts are
described in some detail here, later modules in company analysis in the Equity topic
area will discuss forecasting in much greater detail.


Company Overview
Rémy, whose reporting year ends 31 March, operates and reports three business
segments:
   1. Cognac. This division, composed primarily of Rémy Martin brand cognac,
      represented approximately 73 percent of FY2021 (year-end 31 March 2021)
      revenue and 94 percent of total current operating profit. Current operating
      profit is a non-IFRS measure reported by Rémy equal to IFRS operating
      profit excluding items related to discontinued brands or items deemed infre-
      quent or immaterial, such as impairment or litigation provisions.

                              2. Liqueurs & Spirits. A diverse portfolio of spirits brands, the main brands in
                                 this segment are Cointreau, Metaxa, St-Rémy, Mount Gay, Bruichladdich,
                                 and The Botanist. The segment represented approximately 25 percent of

                              3. Partner Brands. This segment includes other companies’ brands that are
                                 marketed through Rémy’s distribution network. They represented approx-
                                 imately 3 percent of FY2021 revenue and just under 0 percent of current
                                 operating profit, earning a slight operating loss in FY2021 of –EUR0.8 mil-
                                 lion. This division’s importance has declined significantly over time as the
                                 company discontinued distribution (“partner brand”) contracts.
                               Segment financial information is summarized in Exhibit 1. As shown, the compa-
                           ny’s largest business segment is also its most profitable: The Cognac segment earned
                           a current operating profit margin of approximately 30 percent (= EUR221 million/
                           EUR735 million) in fiscal year 2021. Exhibits are in the downloadable Microsoft Excel

Revenue Forecast
For each segment, the change in revenue is driven by volume, price, and foreign cur-
rency estimates that are based on historical trends as adjusted for expected deviations
from trend. Price changes refer not only to price changes for a single product but
also to changes in mix, which are defined as changes resulting from selling varying
quantities of higher- and lower-priced products. Changes in revenue attributable to
volume or price/mix are organic growth and are shown separately from the impact
of acquisitions and divestitures (scope change) and foreign exchange (forex impact
in the model).
    In the Cognac segment, historical volume growth is usually in the 4 to –6 percent
range. For future years, volume growth is expected to remain robust but slower than the
9.1 percent achieved in 2021 as the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated recession fades (volumes were down 10.1 percent in FY2020). The growing
number of affluent Asian consumers will likely keep demand high, while developed
market consumption is likely to be rather flat. In the model, the assumption is for 7
percent volume growth in 2022, declining to 6 percent in 2023 and 2024.
    Price/mix contributed approximately 6.0 percent, 2.6 percent, and –5.4 percent to
the Cognac segment revenue growth in FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021, respectively.
Although the impact of price/mix on revenue growth has fluctuated in recent years,
price/mix will likely remain a relatively significant contributor to revenue growth in
the future given the favorable structure of the industry and the company’s efforts to
increase the share of revenues accounted for by what it calls “exceptional spirits” (those
that cost more than USD50 per bottle and are seeing a 10 percent annual demand
growth). A 4 percent price/mix contribution to revenue growth is assumed in 2022,
with the trend maintained into 2023 and 2024. The combined projections for 2022 of
7 percent volume growth and 4 percent price/mix impact results in overall organic
revenue growth of 11.3 percent, calculated as [(1 + 0.07) × (1 + 0.04)] – 1.
    In addition to the impact of volume and price/mix, Rémy’s revenues are affected
by movements in exchange rates. Company disclosures indicate that more than 70
percent of revenues are realized outside the eurozone, whereas most of Rémy’s pro-
duction occurs within the eurozone. The model forecasts no foreign currency impact
on revenue in the 2022–24 forecast period.

                                    COGS
                                    Rémy’s gross margin has remained roughly flat from FY2018 (67.5 percent) to FY2021
                                    (67.3 percent) as total sales have decreased modestly. Going forward, we project gross
                                    margin to increase by 100 bps in each of the next three years based on increasing
                                    total revenues, particularly from price/mix, which is strongly accretive to gross mar-
                                    gin (see the previous section on “Revenue Forecast”). Management has set a FY2030
                                    objective of a 72.0 percent gross margin, largely in line with our forecasts. Should
                                    revenue growth prove more (less) robust than our forecast, we expect more (less)
                                    gross margin accretion.


                                    SG&A Expenses and Other Operating Expenses
                                    Distribution costs increased significantly over time, from 26.1 percent of revenue in
                                    FY2009 (not shown in the exhibits) to 38 percent in FY2018, and thereafter decreasing
                                    to 33.8 percent in FY2021. In particular, the setup of Rémy’s distribution network in
                                    Asia increased the cost base. Rémy is very committed to its brand building and is
                                    also diversifying geographically. We estimate modest increases in distribution costs
                                    as a percentage of revenue, of 20 bps per year. Administrative costs as a percentage
                                    of revenue have increased from 8.1 percent to 10.1 percent as revenues have fallen,
                                    owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the growth in absolute euro amounts
                                    has been modest, with costs of approximately EUR100 million in FY2019–FY2021.
                                    We expect 1 percent growth in administrative costs per year through FY2024E.
                                        Other operating expenses (income), composed primarily of provisions for impair-
                                    ments of intangible assets, restructurings, and divestiture gains, has fluctuated from
                                    –EUR2 million to EUR20 million from FY2018 to FY2021. Because we do not antic-
                                    ipate any transactions that would result in other operating expenses or income, we
                                    forecast zero for this line in the model.

Operating Profit by Segment
In this section, we alternatively estimate operating profit and margin using a segment
approach. Rémy discloses current operating profit for each of its segments as well
as an operating cost at the corporate or holding company level. Recall that current
operating profit is a non-IFRS measure that excludes certain items. These certain items
are disclosed on Rémy’s income statement as “Other operating expenses (income).”
Therefore, the sum of the segment current operating profit equals consolidated EBIT
before other operating expenses (income).
    For the Cognac segment, the forecast of higher revenue growth, based partially on
strong price/mix growth, assumes an improving product mix that will also result in a
higher gross margin. But the benefit to gross margin will be somewhat mitigated by
higher distribution costs. Thus, the expectation is that the Cognac segment’s operating
margin will increase to 33.4 percent by FY2024. As a benchmark, this forecast can be
compared with the financial results reported by Hennessy (part of LVMH), another
cognac brand. That company’s operating margin in its Wine & Spirits segment in
FY2017–2019 was 30–32 percent, though that business has a significantly higher mix
of lower-priced products with lower gross margins.
    For the other segments, there is not much upside. In the Liqueurs & Spirits divi-
sion, we assume operating margin to increase modestly to 13.6 percent. In total, Rémy
Cointreau Group’s consolidated operating margin is forecast to improve from 23.4
percent in FY2021 to 27.6 percent in FY2024, largely because of growth and margin
improvement in the Cognac segment, the most profitable division, and leverage from
that sales growth on corporate-level costs.
    While a segment approach like Exhibit 5 can be used instead of a consolidated
approach to forecasting revenue and operating profit, it is also commonly used as a
“check” on the consolidated forecasts. This analysis revealed, for example, that the
model relies significantly on margin improvement in the Cognac segment.

                                    Non-Operating Items
                                    Three types of non-operating line items are included in the model: finance expenses
                                    (i.e., interest expenses), income taxes, and shares outstanding.
                                         Net finance cost on Rémy’s income statement is interest expense on debt less inter-
                                    est income earned on cash and investments. Forecasting net finance cost, therefore,
                                    requires estimating the debt and cash positions and interest rates paid and earned.
                                         Companies pay a fixed or variable interest rate on debt. If the interest rate is
                                    variable, the rate is typically determined by a market reference rate plus a credit
                                    spread. As shown in Exhibit 6, Rémy’s interest expenses are fixed and calculated as
                                    1.7 percent incurred on gross debt at the beginning of the period (EUR720 million at
                                    end of FY2020). Other financial expenses are assumed to be zero. Gross debt and the
                                    interest rate paid on it are estimated to remain flat from the year ended FY2021 level
                                         Although interest income is typically forecasted after forecasting the cash position
                                    from the forecasted statement of cash flows, in this case we have simply estimated
                                    EUR0 in interest income through the model period; in each of FY2018–FY2021, annual
                                    interest income was EUR0, EUR0, EUR0.1, and EUR0.2 million, respectively, because
                                    Rémy maintains its liquidity in assets with zero or very low yields. For companies that

own liquid assets with higher interest rates, or in higher interest rate environments,
interest income should be forecast in the same manner as interest expense: forecasted
cash and investments multiplied by a forecasted interest rate.

Corporate Income Tax Forecast
The French statutory corporate income tax rate at the time of analysis is 32 percent.
Rémy Cointreau Group’s effective tax rate has, over the longer run, been close to the
statutory rate. Therefore, an estimated 32 percent effective tax rate is used in the
forecast period. Rémy has no material minority interests in any of its subsidiaries.


Shares Outstanding
Shares outstanding to compute earnings per share (EPS) on the income statement
are disclosed in two ways, both weighted averages throughout the fiscal year: basic
and diluted. Basic shares outstanding includes common equity securities outstanding,
while diluted shares outstanding is a type of what-if analysis; it is basic shares out-
standing plus the number of shares from the exercise or conversion of in-the-money
instruments, less an assumed repurchase of those if-issued shares.
    Typically, the two major factors that affect shares outstanding over time are
share issuance related to equity-based compensation of employees (increases shares
outstanding) and share repurchases (decreases shares outstanding). Less common
but sometimes significant transactions that also affect shares outstanding include
acquisitions financed with stock, secondary issuance, and conversions of preferred
stock or other instruments to common stock.
    Exhibit 7 shows beginning and ending basic shares outstanding for the past six
fiscal years as well as the annual net amount of share repurchases and issuance, which
were gathered from the statements of stockholders’ equity and notes to financial state-
ments. Additionally, the basic and diluted shares outstanding on the income statement
used to calculate basic and diluted EPS (weighted averages) are shown and differed
by approximately 2.6 million shares in each of the past five years.

                                      As evident in Exhibit 7, shares outstanding for Rémy have not changed materially in
                                      six years because the company does not pay significant share-based compensation nor
                                      has it repurchased shares. Additionally, management has not disclosed an intention
                                      to repurchase shares in the near term. Therefore, the model assumes that weighted
                                      average basic and diluted shares outstanding on the income statement remain flat at
                                      the FY2021 level.

                                      can be constructed, as shown in Exhibit 8. Although not presented on the face of the

                           Pro Forma Statement of Cash Flows
                           The forecast statements of cash flows begin with forecasted net income and other
                           amounts from the forecast income statement, and then typically require estimates
                           for capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization, working capital, share-based
                           compensation, dividends, and share repurchases. Once the forecasted income state-
                           ments and statements of cash flows are completed, forecasting the balance sheet is
                           largely a matter of properly linking the spreadsheet, as illustrated in Exhibit 9.

                           Capital Investments and Depreciation Forecasts
                           Capital investment, or capex, as a percentage of revenue was 5.3 percent in FY2021.
                           Given the healthy volume growth prospects, we expect capex to remain at a modestly
                           above historical average level of 5.0 percent of sales through FY2024. With Rémy’s
                           growing fixed asset base, it is logical that depreciation will increase. The model assumes
                           that depreciation and amortization (D&A) is equal to 4.2 percent of prior year fixed
                           assets, the average of the past three years. The breakdowns of capex and D&A are
                           shown in Exhibit 10.

Working Capital Forecasts
We have assumed that working capital ratios will remain similar to what the company
experienced in the FY2018–21 period. In Exhibit 11, we include only the relevant bal-
ance sheet items related to revenues and costs (i.e., inventories, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable) and keep the other items constant. Rémy Cointreau Group had
positive net working capital of 105 percent of its sales in fiscal year 2021. The largest
working capital component is inventory because much of Rémy’s cognac requires years
of aging. Inventory days on hand in FY2021 was 1,493, which reflects an approximate
300-day increase owing to the volume slowdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Inventory days are partially mitigated by extended payment terms to suppliers; days
payable outstanding has averaged around 500 days since FY2018.
    We model the working capital accounts by projecting working capital ratios (days
of inventory, days sales outstanding, days payable outstanding) which are combined
with the sales and cost of sales forecast to produce projected working capital accounts
on the balance sheet. We expect inventory days to decline through FY2024 as the
inventory increase that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic is worked through,
days sales outstanding to remain at FY2021 levels, and for model days payable out-
standing to decline back to an average level, again reflecting a normalization after
the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the decrease in inventory days, the model
projects a net positive contribution from working capital to the reconciliation of net
income to cash flows from operations on the statement of cash flows, which is in stark
contrast to prior years’ negative contribution.

                           Forecasted Cash Flow Statement
                           With net income, D&A, change in working capital, capex, and debt estimates already in
                           place, the cash flow statement shown in Exhibit 12 is almost automatically generated by
                           linking the relevant lines on a spreadsheet. The three significant items left to forecast
                           are share-based compensation, share repurchases or issuance, and dividends. Going
                           forward, the model assumes flat share-based compensation, no share repurchases or
                           issuance, and dividends paid equal to the FY2021 level through FY2024. Lines labeled
                           “other” are aggregated and zeroed out going forward because they are immaterial,
                           difficult to forecast, or both.

Forecasted Balance Sheet
The forecasted balance sheet is given in Exhibit 13 and is based on the combination
of the projected income statement (Exhibit 8), the projected statement of cash flows
(Exhibit 12), and the historical starting balance sheet. The balance sheet items that were
not specifically discussed are held constant, which preserves the accounting identity.
For ease of presentation, the stockholders’ equity lines (e.g., common stock, additional
paid in capital, retained earnings, treasury shares, accumulated other comprehensive
income) are aggregated. For each forecast period, common stockholders’ equity is
the prior year value plus net income and share-based compensation less dividends.
    If each of the discussed lines is linked properly—and other lines are held constant
from FY2021—the forecasted balance sheet should balance each year. Consult the
Rémy worksheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook for greater detail.

Valuation Model Inputs
A financial statement model is the starting point for most valuation models. Valuation

EBITDA, and EBIT. The company-specific inputs needed to build a discounted cash

              3            BEHAVIORAL FINANCE AND ANALYST FORECASTS

                                         explain how behavioral factors affect analyst forecasts and
                                         recommend remedial actions for analyst biases

                           Studies have shown that experts in many fields persistently make forecasting errors
                           arising from behavioral biases, and investment analysts’ models of financial statements
                           are in no way immune. To improve forecasts and the investment decisions based on
                           them, analysts must be aware of the impact of biases and potential remedies for them.
                           Five key behavioral biases that influence analyst forecasts are overconfidence, illusion
                           of control, conservatism, representativeness, and confirmation bias.


                           Overconfidence in Forecasting
                           Overconfidence bias occurs when people demonstrate unwarranted faith in their own
                           abilities. Studies have identified that 90 percent confidence intervals for forecasts,
                           which should leave only 10 percent error rates, turn out to be wrong as much as 40
                           percent of the time (Russo and Schoemaker 1992). Studies have also suggested that
                           individuals are more confident when making contrarian predictions that counter the
                           consensus. That is, overconfidence arises more frequently when forecasting what
                           others do not expect (Dunning, Griffin, Milojkovic, and Ross 1990).
                               To mitigate overconfidence bias, analysts should record and share their forecasts
                           and review them regularly, identifying both the correct and incorrect forecasts they
                           have made. Given the wide range of outcomes for most financial variables, an analyst
                           will likely find that they have been wrong as much or more often than they have been
                           right. The goal is to recognize that forecast error rates are high, so mitigating actions
                           that widen the confidence interval of forecasts should be taken. One such action is
                           scenario analysis. By asking, “Where could I be wrong and by how much?,” an analyst
                           can generate different forecast scenarios.

EXAMPLE 1

   Mitigating Overconfidence: Scenario Analysis for Rémy
   In the prior lesson, a financial statement model was constructed for Rémy
   Cointreau Group that includes only one set of forecasted numbers, or one sce-
   nario. Creating several more scenarios is an important modeling step because the
   range of outcomes for the most important variable is wider than a single point.
       Three important variables in the forecast of free cash flow are organic sales
   growth in the Cognac segment, EBIT margin, and net working capital as a per-
   centage of sales. A benefit of the spreadsheet-driven model is that the forecasts
   can be easily modified to calculate different free cash flow estimates. The base
   case inputs and forecast for 2024E free cash flow to the firm, as well as figures
   for two different scenarios, are shown in Exhibit 15.
       Alternative Scenario 1 assumes that the Cognac segment’s organic growth
   remains the same as its FY2021 rate, an EBIT margin of 23.6 percent, where it
   was before the COVID-19 pandemic, and working capital of 86 percent of sales,
   also the pre-pandemic level from FY2019. Alternative Scenario 2 assumes the
   same Cognac segment organic growth rate as the base case but an EBIT margin
   of 25.0 percent and working capital of 90 percent of sales. This scenario reflects
   strong growth but a high level of reinvestment in sales and marketing costs and
   aged cognac inventory to support that growth.
       As Exhibit 15 demonstrates, there is a wide range of free cash flow estimates
   for 2022E–2024E because of a wide range of reasonable inputs for key variables.

Illusion of Control
A bias often linked to overconfidence, illusion of control is a tendency to overestimate
the ability to control what cannot be controlled and to take ultimately fruitless actions
in pursuit of control. This bias often manifests in analysts’ beliefs that forecasts can
470   Learning Module 12                                              Introduction to Financial Statement Modeling


                           be rendered more accurate in two ways: by acquiring more information and opinions
                           from experts and by creating more granular and complex models. Although additional
                           information and complexity in model specification can improve forecasting accuracy,
                           there are diminishing marginal returns. The amount of material information available
                           for an investment is finite and adding immaterial information will mislead. Complex
                           models tend to be overfitted to historical data sets which do not prove robust in a
                           range of environments that include never-before-seen outliers. Excessive breadth of
                           data and model complexity can also conceal assumptions and make updating forecasts
                           upon the receipt of new information difficult. Finally, analysts face significant oppor-
                           tunity costs; additional hours modeling one company could mean that the analyst will
                           examine fewer opportunities in total.
                               Beyond awareness of the bias and the recognition that uncertainty is an inherent
                           characteristic in investments, illusion of control can be mitigated by restricting mod-
                           eling variables to those that are regularly disclosed by the company, focusing on the
                           most important or impactful variables, and speaking only with those who are likely
                           to have unique or significant perspectives.

                             region (Europe/Middle East/Africa, the Americas, and Asia Pacific). It does not
                             disclose segment revenue by geographic region (e.g., the Cognac segment revenue
                             in the Asia Pacific region), nor does it disclose revenue by sales channel, such
                             as retailers versus bars and restaurants, travel retail, and so on. In its quarterly
                             earnings calls, however, the company often makes numerous references to
                             segment growth rates in specific regions and growth rates of specific channels,
                             even though the actual numbers are not disclosed. Such a practice is common,
                             especially during the COVID-19 pandemic because large sales channel shifts
                             occurred: travel retail in most regions experienced declines >90 percent, sales
                             shifted from bars and restaurants to retailers for at-home consumption, and
                             different geographies were affected by the pandemic at different times.
                                 An analyst might be tempted to collect all these growth rates and other
                             anecdotal figures that management discloses on its earnings calls and, perhaps
                             by combining them with third-party estimates of sales, to build an extensive
                             revenue model for Rémy in which each segment is broken out into geographic
                             regions and sales channels.
                                 Although such an endeavor might be useful to set expectations and to mon-
                             itor over time, building the revenue forecast in this way would introduce several
                             problems and probably not materially improve accuracy. First, because the data
                             used in the model are not regularly disclosed, there is no way to check actuals
                             versus estimates. Second, model construction would take dozens of hours. Finally,
                             and perhaps most importantly, whether the constituent small parts of such a
                             model would be accurate is unclear, which would not make the consolidated
                             revenue forecast any more accurate than a simpler model.



                           Conservatism Bias
                           Conservatism bias is a bias in which people maintain their prior views or forecasts
                           by inadequately incorporating new information. This often happens in forecasting
                           when an analyst does not update their forecasting after receiving conflicting infor-
                           mation, such as disappointing earnings results or a competitor action. Although the
Behavioral Finance and Analyst Forecasts                                                   471


most common form of conservatism is the reluctance to incorporate new negative
information into a forecast, analysts could also fail to adequately incorporate positive
information and thus have estimates that are too low. A different name for conser-
vatism bias in this context is anchoring and adjustment, referring to an analyst using
their prior estimates as an “anchor” that is subsequently adjusted. Although nothing
is wrong with modifying a previous forecast, the previous forecast or anchor tends
to exert significant influence; in other words, the adjustment is too small, and the
updated forecast is too close to the previous forecast.
    Conservatism bias can be mitigated by reviews of forecasts and models by an
investment team at a regular interval, such as each quarter, and by creating flexible
models with fewer variables, to make changing assumptions easier. Because conser-
vatism bias is related to overconfidence and the illusion of control, mitigating those
biases can also serve to mitigate conservatism.

EXAMPLE 3

   Conservatism Bias: Rémy Management Guidance for
   FY2022
   The base case forecasts in the Rémy Cointreau Group model call for organic
   revenue growth of 11.3 percent and net income growth of 24 percent in FY2022E
   over FY2021. However, during the earnings call for the fourth quarter of FY2021,
   Rémy management gave the following guidance for FY2022:
       ■   “Fiscal year 2022 will be a strong year of growth and investment, and
           we are on track to achieve our 2030 [objectives of a 72% gross margin
           and 33% operating margin].”
       ■   “Being ahead of [our] 2030 strategic plan and given the favorable
           environment, [we] have decided to revise up [our] strategic invest-
           ments [in sales and marketing] to support brands through the recovery
           and boost their medium-term growth potential by developing brand
           awareness and attractiveness.”
       ■   Fiscal year 2022 will have “top-line and bottom-line growth in the
           mid-teens in organic terms.”
       Based on these comments, your colleague suggests revising the Rémy model
   slightly by reducing the operating margin forecast to reduce net income growth
   from 24 percent to 20 percent.

   1. What behavioral bias does your colleague’s suggestion exhibit, and what
      research or steps should be taken, if any, with respect to revising the Rémy
      model? Explain your answer.
      Solution:
      Your colleague is exhibiting conservatism bias or anchoring and adjustment;
      they are anchored to the prior forecast of 24 percent net income growth and
      not fully considering management’s guidance on profitability.
      Changing the model to follow the guidance without further consideration
      is not necessarily appropriate because results can and often do under- or
      outperform guidance. However, in this case, management guidance differs
      quite significantly from the FY2022E forecast on both sales growth and net
      income growth. As a first step, management’s credibility should be assessed
      by examining the company’s performance against management guidance
      in the past. Second, the guidance should be considered as a scenario in the
      scenario analysis, and the investment implications of that scenario should

                                 be examined; for example, if the company will in fact increase sales and
                                 profits at a mid-teens rate in FY2022, does that result in an investment de-
                                 cision? Finally, the performance of, and guidance provided by, other alcohol
                                 and spirits companies should be compared to these figures as a check for
                                 reasonableness.



                           Representativeness Bias
                           Representativeness bias refers to the tendency to classify information based on past
                           experiences and known classifications. New information might resemble or seem
                           representative of familiar elements already classified but can in fact be very different
                           and is better viewed from a different perspective. In these instances, the classification
                           reflex can deceive, producing an incorrect understanding that biases all future thinking
                           about the information. Base-rate neglect is a common form of representativeness bias
                           in forecasting. In base-rate neglect, a phenomenon’s rate of incidence in a larger popu-
                           lation, or characteristics of a larger class to which a specific member belongs—its base
                           rate—is neglected in favor of situation- or member-specific information. Considering
                           the base rate is sometimes known as the “outside view,” while the situation-specific
                           is known as the “inside view.”
                               For example, an analyst is modeling operating costs and margins for a biopharma-
                           ceutical company. The “inside view” approach would consider company-specific factors
                           such as the types of drugs the company sells, the number of salespeople needed in
                           each geographic region for each drug, and so on. The “outside view” approach would
                           view the company as a member of the “biopharmaceuticals” industry, of which there
                           are many others, and use industry or sector averages for gross margin, R&D expense
                           as percentage of sales, and so on in the model.
                               Neither the outside nor inside view is superior; what makes for a superior forecast
                           is considering both. One way of doing so is by starting with the base rate but deter-
                           mining which factors make the target company different from the base rate or class
                           average and what the implications of those differences are, if any. For example, the
                           analyst modeling the biopharmaceuticals company might start with industry averages
                           in the model but change some of the variables to account for factors such as royalties
                           versus product sales revenues, geographic composition of revenues, and whether the
                           company is likely to face patent expirations on its products over the forecast period.

                           EXAMPLE 4

                              Considering Base Rates for Rémy
                              While constructing the Rémy model in the prior lesson, little attention was given
                              to comparable companies or to the broader industry to which Rémy belongs. In
                              other words, the model was constructed primarily with the “inside view.” In this
                              example, Rémy is put in the context of six other spirits-focused alcohol compa-
                              nies: Brown-Forman Corporation, Pernod Ricard SA, Davide Campari-Milano
                              N.V., Diageo plc, Becle S.A.B de C.V. (Cuervo), and the Wine & Spirits segment
                              of LVMH (LVMH W&S) for the five most recently reported fiscal years at the
                              time of analysis. The variable used for the industry comparison is the five-year
                              average of EBIT margin because it is a key model input, and the profitability of
                              an individual company is strongly influenced by industry profitability. Many of
                              these peer companies are significantly larger by revenue than Rémy, which is
                              useful because we have modeled Rémy becoming larger over time. The analysis
                              for Exhibit 16 is included in the Exhibit 16 worksheet in the downloadable

   1. Evaluate the base case forecasts in the Rémy model as well as Rémy’s man-
      agement’s FY2030 objective of a 33 percent operating margin considering
      the analysis in Exhibit 16.
      Solution:
      The base case forecasts in the Rémy model are for EBIT margins of 24.8
      percent, 26.2 percent, and 27.6 percent in FY2022E, FY2023E, and FY2024E,
      respectively. The most recently reported fiscal year(s) for most of the peer
      companies include the effect of deleveraging from sales declines associated
      with the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from that, the base case forecasts are
      close to the peer average and by that measure appear reasonable, though
      they are substantially higher than the past five years of profitability for Rémy
      itself.
      Rémy management’s objective of 33 percent operating margin in 2030 ap-
      pears high relative to those of its peers; only one company, Brown Forman,
      has achieved that level of profitability, on annual revenues ~3.0× that of
      Rémy. Industry-leading growth and profitability of Rémy’s Cognac segment
      will be required to meet this objective.



Confirmation Bias
Confirmation bias is the tendency to look for and notice what confirms prior beliefs
and to ignore or undervalue whatever contradicts them. A common manifestation
of this bias among investment analysts is to structure the research process in pursuit
of only positive news or certain criteria, or with a narrow scope. For example, an
analyst might research a particular company but conduct only cursory research on
its competitors and companies that offer substitute products. An analyst who has a
positive view on a company might speak only to other analysts who share that view
and the company’s management, all of whom will likely tell the analyst what they want
to hear and already know. Confirmation bias is closely related to overconfidence and
representativeness biases.

                               The extent to which company management can be excessively optimistic is shown
                           in Exhibit 17, which analyzes the annual report of a major European bank for 2007,
                           published mere months before it entered bankruptcy and was nationalized.
                               Speaking with management is valuable given their role and should not be excluded
                           from the research process, but analysts must be aware of management’s inherent bias
                           and seek differing perspectives, especially when examining a company with significant
                           controversy. Two approaches to mitigating confirmation bias in the forecasting process
                           are to speak to or read research from analysts with a negative opinion on the security
                           under scrutiny and to seek perspectives from colleagues who are not economically or
                           psychologically invested in the subject security.

                           One of the tools that analysts can use to think about how competition will affect
                           financial results is Michael Porter’s widely used “five forces” framework (see Porter
                           1980) introduced in earlier learning modules.


                           Cognac Industry Overview
                           The cognac segment is Rémy Cointreau Group’s most important business segment,
                           accounting for over 90 percent of total operating profit. An important feature of the
                           cognac market is that supply is limited and demand is growing. Supply is limited
                           because the production of cognac, like that of champagne, is highly regulated, in this
                           case through The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac. By regulation, cognac
                           can be produced only in a limited geographic area, in and around the town of Cognac

in southwest France. Furthermore, within the region, production volume is capped
each year. Approximately 98 percent of production is exported. The cognac market is
highly concentrated, with the top four players controlling 78 percent of world volume
and 84 percent of global value. Rémy’s market share is approximately 16 percent and
18 percent of global volume and value, respectively (The Spirits Business, June 2018).
Demand for cognac has been growing because of increasing demand from Asia, par-
ticularly China and Singapore, more than offsetting a weakening European market.
The global spirits market has grown more than 5 percent annually during the 2000–17
period (Source: IWSR drinks market analysis). Simultaneously, Rémy has also seen
a product mix improvement because consumers increasingly prefer superior quality
and more expensive cognac. Exhibit 18 summarizes Porter’s five forces analysis of
the cognac industry.



  Exhibit 18: Porter’s Five Forces Analysis of the Cognac Industry

Force                  Degree       Factors to Consider

Threat of               Low         ■   Cognac consumers show brand loyalty and do not
substitutes                             easily shift to other beverages or high-end spirits.
Rivalry                 Low         ■   The market is consolidated, with four players con-
                                        trolling 78 percent of the world market in volume
                                        and 84 percent of global value.
                                    ■   Only the European market is fragmented, with less
                                        than half of the market controlled by the top four.
Bargaining power    Low/medium      ■   A large number of small independent vineyards
of suppliers                            supply inputs.
                                    ■   Most of the distillation is carried out by a large body
                                        of independent distillers that sell to the big houses.
Bargaining power        Low         ■   Premium beverages are sold primarily to wine
of buyers                               and spirits retail outlets that do not coordinate
                                        purchasing.
                                    ■   Premium beverages are consumed primarily in small
                                        and fragmented on-premises outlets (restaurants,
                                        etc.).
Threat of new           Low         ■   Producers have long-term contracts with suppliers in
entrants                                the Cognac area.
                                    ■   Barriers to entry are high.
                                        ●   Building brands is difficult because they must have
                                            heritage/pedigree.
                                        ●   A large capital investment is required to build an
                                            inventory with “aged” cognac and set up a distribu-
                                            tion network.

In summary, the cognac market, Rémy’s largest and most profitable operating segment,
exhibits a favorable profitability profile. In addition to limited supply and growing
demand, the industry faces a generally favorable situation with respect to substitutes,
rivalry, suppliers, buyers, and potential new entrants.

                            Analysis of Anheuser-Busch InBev Using Porter’s Five
                            Forces
                            The competitive structure a company faces can vary among countries, with
                            implications for modeling revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures,
                            and return on investments. For example, Anheuser-Busch (AB) InBev, the largest
                            global brewer, operates in many countries, two of which are the United Kingdom
                            and Brazil, the world’s third largest beer market. AB InBev’s competitive position
                            and prospects in the highly consolidated and growing Brazilian market are much
                            more favorable than in the fragmented and declining UK market.
                                The Brazilian beer market is divided among four players. AmBev (AB InBev’s
                            subsidiary in Brazil, of which it owns a 61.9 percent stake) is the dominant brewer
                            with an estimated 65 percent market share in 2018 versus 20 percent for Heineken
                            and 12 percent for Petropolis, Brazil’s largest privately owned brewing group.
                            Helped by its dominant market position and strong distribution network, AmBev
                            was able to report an EBITDA margin of nearly 50.4 percent in 2018 (ri.ambev.
                            com.br), the highest in the global beer industry. The industry participants focus
                            less on price competition and more on expanding distribution and “premium-
                            ization” (i.e., selling more expensive beers.) Although the 2015–18 time period
                            saw challenging trading conditions due to subdued consumer demand, causing
                            years of decline in the market by volume, Brazil is still considered a promising
                            market. In this environment, an analyst would likely forecast solid revenue growth
                            for AmBev. Exhibit 19 presents an analysis of the Brazilian beer market using
                            Porter’s five forces framework. Most of the competitive forces represent a low
                            threat to profitability (consistent with AmBev’s historical profitability), implying
                            that analysts would most likely forecast continued above-average profitability.
                                                                        ​

       The UK beer market is also divided among four players, but the competitive
   structure is totally different than in Brazil. The market is more fragmented, with
   smaller market shares held by the largest players. Heineken, MolsonCoors,
   AB InBev, and Carlsberg had market shares of 24 percent (adbrands.net), 18
   percent, 18 percent (www​.ab​-inbev​.com), and 11 percent (carlsberggroup.
   com), respectively, in 2018. Consequently, the British market has no dominant
   brewer. Given the high fixed costs of a brewery, declining volumes of UK beer
   consumption, and the highly consolidated customer base, which provides the
   clients with substantial purchasing power (particularly in the retail channels),
   price competition is usually intense. A gradual switch from drinking beer in
   pubs and restaurants (“on-trade”) to consumption at home (“off-trade”) is mak-
   ing brewers even more exposed to the bargaining power of the dominant retail
   supermarket (grocers) chains. Increasing taxes on beer and rents faced by pub
   landlords add to the burden faced by the industry, leading to a steady decline
   of Britain’s pub industry. Profitability has been lower than the beer industry’s
   global average; operating margins are believed to be less than 10 percent. In
   this kind of environment, analysts would most likely forecast only very cautious
   revenue growth, if any. Exhibit 20 presents an analysis of the UK beer market
   using Porter’s five forces framework.

                              There is a distinction between Porter’s five forces and other factors that can affect
                           profitability, such as government regulation and taxes:
                                  Industry structure, as manifested in the strength of the five competi-
                                  tive forces, determines the industry’s long-run profit potential because
                                  it determines how the economic value created by the industry is divided.
                                  Government is not best understood as a sixth force because government
                                  involvement is neither inherently good nor bad for industry profitability.
                                  The best way to understand the influence of government on competition
                                  is to analyze how specific government policies affect the five competitive
                                  forces. (Porter 2008, page 10)

                             In 20X2, EuroAlco was the beer market leader in Eurolandia (a fictional country)
                             with 35 percent market share. The other four large brewers held 15 percent, 15
                             percent, 10 percent, and 7 percent share, respectively. The Eurolandia market is
                             considered a growth market. It historically had high overall alcohol consumption
                             but a relatively low per capita consumption of beer, a product that is attracting
                             interest from the growing, younger population and is further supported by
                             increasing disposable incomes.
                                 At the start of year 20X1, the Eurolandia government, in its fight to curb
                             alcohol consumption, tripled the excise duty (a special tax) on beer from EUR0.3
                             per liter to EUR0.9 and announced that excise duty will further increase by
                             EUR0.1 per liter.
                                 In the following year, 20X2, EuroAlco made efforts to strengthen the position
                             of the more expensive brands in its portfolio. These efforts led to a 20 percent
                             increase in selling costs. Similar to most consumer staple companies, EuroAlco
                             experienced higher production costs. Poor grain harvests put price pressure on
                             buyers of almost all feedstocks, and rising oil prices resulted in higher packag-
                             ing costs. In 20X2, competing companies were much more cautious with A&P
                             spending than EuroAlco.

      Two analysts research EuroAlco at the start of year 20X3. In making their
   EuroAlco forecasts, both analysts use market data and the published annual
   report from EuroAlco (see Exhibit 21 and/or the Example 7 worksheet in the
   downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook). Based on the published data, they
   consider a number of scenarios and reach different conclusions.

                           Both analysts assume that the government will impose a further increase in the
                           excise duty (special tax on beer). They also assume that the excise duty increase
                           will be borne by the consumers, who will face a 10 percent price increase that
                           will allow the brewers to maintain their net (after-tax) revenues per hectoliter
                           (hl). They assume that half the cost of sales is fixed per hectoliter and half is
                           variable based on volume, that selling expenses will remain unchanged as a
                           percentage of sales, and that administrative expenses are fixed.

                           1. Analyst A expects price elasticity of 0.8, indicating that volume will fall by
                              8 percent given the 10 percent retail price increase. Calculate the impact
                              on operating profit and operating profit margin in 20X3 using Exhibit 22,
                              which is also in the Example 7 sheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel

      Solution:
      Exhibit 23 (see the Example 7 worksheet in the downloadable Microsoft
      Excel workbook) shows the results for both analysts’ projections. Analyst
      A predicts that operating profit will decrease by 25 percent to EUR608 in
      20X3, resulting in an operating margin decline from 13.0 percent in 20X2
      to 10.6 percent in 20X3. Analyst A calculates a revenue decline of 8 per-
      cent to EUR5,736 based on volume dropping by 8 percent and a constant
      price per hectoliter of EUR215. The decrease in volume reflects the price
      elasticity of 0.8 and the price increase of 10 percent as a result of the excise
      duty increase. COGS sold fell only 4 percent because part of the costs are
      fixed. COGS as the sum of fixed and variable costs is EUR1,595 + [26.68 (hl
      volume) × 55 (hl cost)] = EUR1,595 + 1,467 (ignoring rounding error) or
      EUR3,062. Analyst A predicts selling expenses will decline in line with sales
      by 8 percent and administrative costs will remain unchanged because of
      their fixed character in the short term.

   2. Analyst B expects price elasticity of 0.5, indicating that volume will fall by
      5 percent given the 10 percent retail price increase. Calculate the impact
      on operating profit and operating profit margin in 20X3 using Exhibit 22,
      which is also in the Example 7 sheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel
      workbook.
      Solution:
      Analyst B forecasts that operating profit will decline by 16 percent to
      EUR684. Analyst B’s calculations follow the same pattern as those of Analyst
      A, but Analyst B predicts a smaller, 5 percent, decline in volume. Analyst
      A’s estimates are more pessimistic than those of Analyst B. Note that the net
      price per hectoliter for the brewer is held constant while the price for the
      consumer increased 10 percent as a result of the excise duty increase. Be-
      cause of Analyst B’s more optimistic volume forecast, fixed costs are spread
      over a higher level of sales than is the case for Analyst A. Consequently, An-
      alyst B will have a higher operating margin estimate than Analyst A. Howev-
      er, both analysts are predicting a decline in operating margin in 20X3.

                           3. Gross margin improved in 20X1 (50.0 percent) but fell in 20X2 (48.8 per-
                              cent). Cost of sales was relatively high in 20X2 because of high barley costs,
                              an important ingredient for brewing beer. Assume that in 20X2, half of the
                              cost of sales is fixed and half is based on volume. Of the variable part of
                              the cost of sales, assume that half the amount is related to the barley price
                              in 20X2. Barley prices increased 25 percent in 20X2. Consider a scenario
                              where no additional taxes are imposed in 20X3, revenues and volumes re-
                              main stable, and barley prices return to their 20X1 level. Calculate EuroAl-
                              co’s estimated gross margin for 20X3.
                             Solution:
                             If barley prices return to their 20X1 level, they will decline 20 percent in
                             20X3. Because volumes are assumed to remain constant, other variable
                             costs will not change. Gross profit in 20X2 was 48.8 percent of sales, which
                             indicates the cost of sales was 51.2 percent (100% ‒ 48.8%). Barley is 25
                             percent of the cost of sales (because barley represents half of variable costs,
                             and variable cost of sales represents half of total cost of sales). Cost of sales
                             is predicted to decline by 25% × 20% = 5%. New cost of sales will be 51.2%
                             ‒ (5% × 51.2%) or 48.6 percent. Consequently, gross margin is predicted to
                             be 100% ‒ 48.6% = 51.4% in 20X3. Compared with the gross margin of 48.8
                             percent in 20X2, gross margin is predicted to increase by 260 bps.
                                                                    ​

   4. EuroAlco’s selling expenses increased from 30 percent of sales in 20X1 to
      33.5 percent of sales in 20X2. Which competitive forces most likely influ-
      enced EuroAlco’s significant increase in selling expenses?
      Solution:
      Intra-industry rivalry and threat of substitutes most likely influenced Eu-
      roAlco’s significant increase in selling costs. By spending more on adver-
      tising, EuroAlco wanted to enhance the brand loyalty of its products, thus
      improving its competitive position versus its brewer rivals and makers of
      other alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, buyers’ bargaining power probably
      also influenced EuroAlco’s increased spending to the extent that advertising
      creates demand by the ultimate consumer. Strong demand at the ultimate
      consumer level for EuroAlco’s specific brands could enhance the company’s
      bargaining position with its direct customers, the distributors who serve as
      intermediaries.

   5. Retailers are the direct customers of brewers. They buy directly from the
      brewer and sell to the ultimate consumer. Analyst A expects that the in-
      crease in mass retailers in Eurolandia will cause brewers’ margins to decline.
      He expects EuroAlco’s operating margin will decrease from 13 percent in
      20X2 to 8 percent in 20X6, with stable sales (EUR6,235 million) and an
      unchanged amount of average invested capital (EUR3,000 million). Ana-
      lyst B also sees the increasing importance of the larger food retailers but
      expects that EuroAlco can offset potential pricing pressure by offering more
      attractive trade credit (e.g., allowing the retailers longer payment terms).
      He thinks operating margin can remain stable at 13 percent with no sales
      growth. Average invested capital (EUR3,000 million), however, will double
      because of the extra investments in inventory and receivables. Describe the
      analysts’ expectations about the impact of large retailers on brewers in terms
      of Porter’s five forces and return on invested capital (ROIC; pre-tax). Which
      of the two scenarios would be better for EuroAlco?
      Solution:
      The increase in mass retailers in EuroAlco is expected to strengthen the
      bargaining power of buyers relative to brewers. According to Analyst A, this
      will lead to a lower operating margin of 8 percent, while Analyst B believes
      margins can be maintained if the company offers much more favorable
      credit terms reflected in doubling of invested capital. Analyst A expects
      operating profit on invested capital to fall from 27.1 percent (13 percent ×
      EUR6,235/EUR3,000) to 16.6 percent (8 percent × EUR6,235/EUR3,000).
      Analyst B’s assumptions indicate that the ROIC (operating profit divided by
      invested capital) in 20X2 of 27 percent will fall by half to 13.5 percent as the
      operating profit is earned on double the amount of invested capital (i.e., 13
      percent × EUR6,235/EUR6,000). The scenario envisioned by Analyst A is
      better for EuroAlco. Full supporting calculations are in the Example 7 work-
      sheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook.

                                Porter’s five forces framework and similar analytical tools can help analysts assess
                           the relative profit potential of a company by helping them understand the company’s
                           industry and its position within that industry. Understanding the industry and compet-
                           itive contexts of a company helps analysts estimate whether, for example, sales growth
                           is likely to be relatively high or low (relative to history, relative to the overall growth
                           in the economy or a sector, and/or relative to competing companies) and whether
                           profit margins are likely to be relatively high or low (relative to historical profit mar-
                           gins and relative to competing companies). The process of incorporating an industry
                           and competitive analysis into expectations for future financial performance requires
                           judgment. Suppose analysts observe that a given company is the market leader in a
                           moderately competitive industry with limited buyer and supplier power and relatively
                           high barriers to entry. In broad terms, analysts might project that the company’s
                           future revenue growth will be in line with that of the overall industry and that its
                           profit margins and ROIC might be somewhat higher than those of other companies
                           in the industry. But there is no mechanical link between the analysts’ observations
                           and projecting the company’s future sales growth and profit margin. Instead, the link
                           is more subjective and probabilistic.




              5            MODELING INFLATION AND DEFLATION

                                         explain how to forecast industry and company sales and costs when
                                         they are subject to price inflation or deflation

                           Inflation and deflation (i.e., general increase and decrease in the prices of goods and
                           services) can significantly affect the accuracy of forecasts for a company’s future
                           revenue, profit, and cash flow. The impact of inflation or deflation on revenue and
                           expenses differs from company to company. Even within a single company, the impact
                           of inflation or deflation is generally different for revenue and expenses categories.
                               Some companies are better able to pass on higher input costs by raising the prices
                           at which they sell their output. The ability to pass on price increases can be the result
                           of, for example, strong branding (Coca-Cola) or proprietary technology (Apple).
                           Companies that are well positioned to pass on price increases are, in turn, more likely
                           to have higher and more stable profits and cash flow, relative to competitors.
                               We first consider the impact of inflation on sales and then on costs.


                           Sales Projections with Inflation and Deflation
                           The following analysis addresses the projection of industry sales and company sales
                           in the presence of inflation.

                           Industry Sales and Inflation or Deflation
                           Most increases in the cost of inputs, such as commodities or labor, will eventually
                           result in higher prices for end products. Industry structure can be an important fac-
                           tor in determining the relationship between increases in input costs and increases in
                           the price of end products. For example, in the United States, the beer market is an
                           oligopoly, with one player, AB InBev, controlling almost half of the market. Moreover,
                           the three-tier structure of the US beer market, in which the producers (the brewers)
                           must use a third party (the wholesalers) to get their products (beer) to the consumers
                           (bars, restaurants, and retailers) results in a fragmented customer base because brewers
                           are not allowed to deliver directly to the end consumer but rather must use wholesale
Modeling Inflation and Deflation                                                             485


distributors. These wholesalers often differ state by state. Large nationwide retailers,
such as Walmart, still must negotiate with several different wholesalers instead of
using their dominant national market position to negotiate directly with the brewers.
The industry structure in the United States has likely contributed to increases in beer
prices roughly in line with the US Consumer Price Index. In other words, beer prices
have generally risen during years of inflation in input costs and decreased when costs
have eased (though there have been brief exceptional periods where the opposite has
occurred). If necessary, US brewers have been able to increase prices to compensate
for costs of inflation. In contrast, European beer companies distribute through a more
concentrated customer base—namely, such dominant retail outlets as Carrefour,
Tesco, and Ahold—which results in a weaker pricing position for the brewers. Also,
the European market lacks an overall dominant brewer. As a result of the industry
structure and the lack of underlying volume growth, changes in beer prices in Europe
have been on average 100 bps less than customer inflation.

A company’s efforts to pass on inflation through higher prices can have a negative
impact on volume if the demand is price elastic, which is the case if cheaper substitutes
are available. If selling prices could be increased 10 percent while maintaining unit
sales volume to offset an increase of 10 percent in input costs, gross profit margin
percentage would be the same but the absolute amount of gross profit would increase.
In the short term, however, volumes will usually decline as result of a price increase.
The decline would depend not only on the price elasticity of demand but also on the
reaction of competitors and the availability of substitutes. Lower input costs also
make lower consumer prices possible. The first competitor to lower prices will usually
benefit with an uptick in volume. Competitors react quickly, however, resulting in a
short-term benefit. The price–volume trade-off can make accurate revenue projections
difficult. In an inflationary environment, raising prices too late will result in a profit
margin squeeze but acting too soon could result in volume losses. In a deflationary

too long will result in volume losses.

                               In the highly competitive consumer goods market, pricing is strongly influenced
                           by movements in input prices, which can account for half of the COGS. In some
                           time periods, customers’ price sensitivity has resulted in a strong inverse relationship
                           between volume and pricing. For example, Exhibit 26 illustrates Unilever’s annual
                           underlying volume and price growth from 2001 to 2020. Increased input prices for
                           packaging, wheat, and milk forced Anglo-Dutch consumer staple company Unilever
                           to increase prices for its products significantly in 2008. Consequently, volumes dete-
                           riorated. But as raw material prices fell in 2009–2010, the company’s prices were
                           lowered and volumes recovered strongly. As the company started to increase prices
                           in 2011, volume growth once again slowed. In 2016, the company faced challenging
                           conditions in several emerging markets as currency-devaluation-led cost increases
                           led to weaker volumes. Both volume and price growth have moderated to low-single
                           digit growth rates, also exhibiting lower volatility.

                           Company Sales and Inflation or Deflation
                           Revenue projections in a model are based on the expected volume and price develop-
                           ment. Forecasting revenue for a company faced with inflation in input costs requires
                           some understanding of the price elasticity of the products, the different rates of cost
                           inflation in the countries where the company is active, and, if possible, the likely infla-
                           tion in costs relevant to a company’s individual product categories. Pricing strategy
                           and market position are also important.
                                The impact of higher prices on volume depends on the price elasticity of demand
                           (i.e., how the quantity demanded varies with price). If demand is relatively price
                           inelastic, revenues will benefit from inflation. If demand is relatively price elastic (i.e.,
                           elasticity is greater than unit price elasticity), revenue can decline even if unit prices
                           are raised. For example, a regression of volume on food inflation in UK food stores

from 1989 to 2012 (shown in Exhibit 27) gives a regression slope coefficient of −0.398.
(For every increase by 1 percentage point in year-on-year food prices, year-on-year
sales decreased by approximately 0.4 percent.)
    An analyst covering UK food retailers can use this information when building
forecast profit models. By assuming an expected level of food inflation, volume growth
can be estimated and revenue calculated.

The expected pricing component for an international company should consider the
geographic mix of its revenues to reflect different rates of inflation among countries.
Of course, strategy and competitive factors, in addition to inflation in input costs,
play roles in price setting.
    AB InBev’s volume growth and pricing have been more robust in emerging mar-
kets, for example, thanks to strong demand for its new beer products. The impact of
inflation is also an important factor. In its Latin America South division, which then
mainly consisted of Argentina, the brewer reported strong 24.7 percent organic revenue
growth in 2011, of which only 2.1 percent was driven by volume and the remainder
by price. As costs increased in line with revenues, operating margin remained more
or less stable, and organic operating profit growth was high at 27 percent. With only
a limited negative currency impact, reported operating profit increased 24 percent
in US dollars.
    High inflation in a company’s export market relative to a company’s domestic
inflation rate generally implies that the export country’s currency will come under
pressure and any pricing gain could be wiped out by the currency losses. The strong
pricing increases AB InBev reported in its Latin America South division were clearly

                           driven by input price inflation. The absence of a negative currency impact should be
                           seen as a positive surprise but not as a typical outcome. A country’s currency will
                           usually come under pressure and depreciate if high rates of inflation persist for an
                           extended period.
                               Most analysts adjust for recent high inflation in foreign countries by assuming
                           a normalized growth rate for both revenues and costs after one or two years. This
                           constant currency growth rate is based on an underlying growth rate assumption for
                           the business. This approach can understate revenues in the short term. Other ana-
                           lysts reflect in their forecasts the high impact of inflation on revenues and expenses
                           and adjust growth rates for the expected currency (interest rate parity) impact. This
                           approach is also imperfect given the difficulty in projecting currency rates.
                               Identifying a company’s major input costs provides an indication of likely pricing.
                           For a specialist retail bakery chain, for example, the impact of increased grain prices will
                           be more significant than for a diversified standard supermarket chain. Consequently,
                           it seems logical that the bakery is likely to increase its prices by a higher percentage
                           than the grocer in response to increased grain prices.
                               Company strategy is also an important factor. Faced with rising input prices, a com-
                           pany might decide to preserve its margins by passing on the costs to its customers, or
                           it might decide to accept some margin reduction to increase its market share. In other
                           words, the company could try to gain market share by not fully increasing prices to
                           reflect increased costs. On the one hand, Sysco Company (the largest food distributor
                           to restaurants and institutions in North America) has sometimes not passed on food
                           price increases in recessionary conditions out of concern of not financially weakening
                           already recession-affected customers (e.g., restaurants, private clubs, schools, nursing
                           homes). On the other hand, in 2011 and 2012, the large French cognac houses sub-
                           stantially increased the prices of their products in China to reduce strong demand.
                           Because older cognac generates a higher price, it can be more profitable to build an
                           inventory of vintage cognac rather than maximizing short-term volumes.

                              Four food retail analysts are assessing the impact of a potential increase in input
                              costs on the global supermarket chain Carrefour. In this hypothetical scenario,
                              they believe that rising oil prices and packaging prices will affect many of the
                              company’s suppliers. They believe that Carrefour is likely to be confronted with 4
                              percent inflation in its COGS (with stable volume). The analysts have their own
                              expectations about how the company will react. Exhibit 28 shows Carrefour’s
                              2020 results, and Exhibit 29 shows the four analysts’ estimates of input prices,

    1. What are each analyst’s predictions for gross profit and gross margin?
       Solution:
       The results for each analyst are shown in Exhibit 30 and the Example 8
       worksheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook. For Analyst B,
       revenues increase 4 percent [= (1.02 × 1.02) ‒ 1] and COGS 6.1 percent [=
       (1.02 × 1.04) ‒ 1]. The difference between the calculated revenue and COGS
       is the new gross profit and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of
       revenue.

    2. Which analyst has the highest forecast for gross margin?
       Solution:
       The highest gross margin is projected by Analyst D, who assumes that sell-
       ing prices would increase by 4 percent to offset rising input costs and keep
       gross margin stable from the 2020 level.

       Solution:
       The highest gross profit is projected by Analyst D.



Cost Projections with Inflation and Deflation
The following analysis addresses the forecasting of industry and company costs in the
presence of inflation and deflation.

Industry Costs and Inflation or Deflation
Familiarity with the specific purchasing characteristics of an industry can also be
useful in forecasting costs. For example, long-term price-fixed forward contracts and
hedges can delay the impact of price increases. Thus, an analyst forecasting costs for

                           an industry in which companies customarily use such purchasing practices would
                           incorporate any expected input price fluctuations more slowly than they would for an
                           industry in which the participants do not use long-term contracts or hedges.
                                Monitoring the underlying drivers of input prices can also be useful in forecasting
                           costs. For example, weather conditions can have a dramatic impact on the price of
                           agricultural products and consequently on the cost base of industries that rely on them.
                           An analyst observing a particular weather pattern might thus be able to incorporate
                           this information into forecasts of costs.
                                How inflation or deflation affects an industry’s cost structure depends on its
                           competitive environment. For example, if the participants within the industry have
                           access to alternative inputs or are vertically integrated, the impact of volatility in input
                           costs can be mitigated. Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) is a coffee company that has been
                           facing high and volatile coffee prices. However, its coffee is a blend of different kinds
                           of beans. By shifting the mix slightly, JDE can keep both taste and costs constant by
                           reducing the amount of the more expensive types of coffee beans in the blend. But
                           if all supplier countries significantly increase the price of coffee simultaneously, JDE
                           cannot use blending as an offset and will be confronted with overall higher input
                           costs. To sustain its profitability, JDE will have to increase its prices to its clients.
                           But if competition from other companies, such as Nestlé (Nespresso, Dolce Gusto,
                           Nescafe) makes it difficult to increase prices, JDE will have to look for alternatives if
                           it wants to keep its profit margins stable. An easy solution for the short term could
                           be reducing advertising and promotional (A&P) spending, which usually improves
                           profit. For the longer term, however, it could be harmful for revenues because the
                           company’s brand position could be weakened.
                                For example, in 2010, Russia experienced a heat wave that destroyed large parts of
                           its grain harvest, causing prices for malting barley, a major input for beer, to increase
                           significantly. Carlsberg, as the largest Russian brewer at that time, was particularly
                           hard hit because it had to pay more for its Russian barley and also needed to import
                           grain into the country, incurring additional transportation costs. By increasing imports
                           from Western Europe, Carlsberg also pushed up barley prices in this region, affecting
                           the cost base of other Western European brewers.

                           Company Costs and Inflation or Deflation
                           In forecasting a company’s costs, it is often helpful to segment the cost structure by
                           category and geography. For each item of cost, an assessment should be made about
                           the impact of potential inflation and deflation on input prices. This assessment should
                           take into account the company’s ability to substitute cheaper alternatives for expensive
                           inputs or to increase efficiency to offset the impact of increases in input prices. For
                           example, although a jump in raw material prices in 2011 caused Unilever’s and Nestlé’s
                           gross margins to fall sharply (by 110−170 bps), increases in operational efficiencies,
                           such as reducing advertising spending, enabled both companies to achieve slightly
                           higher overall operating profit margins that year. Example 9 shows the use of common
                           size (percent-of-sales) analysis of inflation in input costs.

                              “Choco A” and a food producer “Sweet B”—have costs that are constantly
                              affected by inflation and deflation. Exhibit 31 (see the Example 9 worksheet in

   Assume inflation of 10 percent for all costs (except depreciation) and that the
   companies are not able to pass on this increase through higher prices (total
   revenues will remain constant).

   1. Calculate the gross profit margin for each company. Which company will
      experience the greater reduction in gross profit margin?
      Solution:
      The company with the higher COGS as a percent of net sales—equivalently,
      the lower gross margin—will experience the greater negative impact. Sweet
      B has a lower gross margin than Choco A: 50 percent compared with 64
      percent, as shown in Exhibit 31. After the 10 percent increase in COGS to
      1.10 × 50% = 55%, Sweet B’s gross margin will fall to 45 percent, as shown
      in Exhibit 32. Sweet B’s resulting gross margin of 45 percent represents a
      proportional decline of 10 percent from the initial value of 50 percent. In
      contrast, the proportional decline in Choco A’s gross margin is approximate-
      ly 4%/64% = 6%.

                              2. Calculate the operating profit margin for each company. Which company
                                 will experience the greater reduction in operating profit (EBIT) margin?
                                 Solution:
                                 Choco A has higher overall costs than Sweet B, primarily as a consequence
                                 of its high SG&A expenses. Choco A’s operating profit margin will drop to
                                 approximately 5 percent, as shown in Exhibit 32, representing a proportion-
                                 al decline of approximately 62 percent compared with a proportional decline
                                 of approximately 8%/16% = 50% for Sweet B.

                              3. Assume inflation of 10 percent only for the raw material costs (reflected in
                                 COGS) and that the companies are not able to pass on this increase through
                                 higher prices. Which company will be more affected negatively in terms of
                                 gross profit margin and operating profit margin?
                                 Solution:
                                 The company with the higher raw material expense component will ex-
                                 perience the more negative effect. In this case, raw materials represent 22
                                 percent of net sales for both Sweet B and Choco A. Gross margin and oper-
                                 ating margin will decline by 220 bps for both. This impact is more severe on
                                 gross margin on a relative basis for Sweet B (2.2%/50% = 4.4% decline) than
                                 for Choco A (2.2%/64% = 3.4% decline). But the relative effect on operating
                                 margin will be more severe for Choco A (2.2%/13% = 16.9% decline) than for
                                 Sweet B (2.2%/16% = 13.8%).




              6            THE FORECAST HORIZON AND LONG-TERM
                           FORECASTING

                                         explain considerations in the choice of an explicit forecast horizon
                                         and an analyst’s choices in developing projections beyond the
                                         short-term forecast horizon

                           The choice of the forecast time horizon can be influenced by certain factors, including
                           the investment strategy for which the security is being considered, the cyclicality of
                           the industry, company-specific factors, and the analyst’s employer’s preferences. Most
                           professionally managed investment strategies describe the investment time frame, or
                           average holding period, in the stated investment objectives of the strategy; the time
                           frame should ideally correspond with average annual turnover of the portfolio. For
                           example, a stated investment time horizon of three to five years would imply average
                           annual portfolio turnover between 20 percent and 33 percent (average holding period
                           is calculated as one/portfolio turnover). The cyclicality of the industry could also
                           influence the analyst’s choice of time frame because the forecast period should be
                           long enough to allow the business to reach an expected mid-cycle level of sales and
                           profitability. Similar to cyclicality, various company-specific factors, including recent
                           acquisition or restructuring activity, can influence the selection of the forecast period
                           to allow enough time for the realization of the expected benefits from such activity
                           to be reflected in the financial statements. In other cases, there might be no individ-
                           ual analyst choice in the sense that the analyst’s employer has specified more or less
                           fixed parameters. Much of the discussion so far has focused on various methods of
                           forecasting a company’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow for an explicit
The Forecast Horizon and Long-Term Forecasting                                                                       493


short-term forecast period. Although the underlying principles remain the same if
one extends the time horizon, certain considerations and choices are available to the
analyst when developing longer-term projections.
    Longer-term projections often provide a better representation of the normalized
earnings potential of a company than a short-term forecast, especially when certain
temporary factors are present. Normalized earnings are the expected level of mid-cycle
earnings for a company in the absence of any unusual or temporary factors that affect
profitability (either positively or negatively). For example, at any given point in time, a
company’s profitability can be influenced by a number of temporary factors, including
the stage in the business cycle, recent merger and acquisition activity, and restructuring
activity. Similarly, normalized free cash flow can be defined as the expected level of
mid-cycle cash flow from operations adjusted for unusual items just described less
recurring capital expenditures. By extending the forecast period, an analyst is able to
adjust for these unusual or temporary factors and derive an estimate of earnings that
the company is likely to earn in a normal year. We will consider various alternatives
for two aspects of long-term forecasting: revenue forecasts and terminal value.
    As with most income statement projections, a long-term forecast begins with a
revenue projection, with most of the remaining income statement items subsequently
derived from the level or change in revenue. Revenue projection methods were cov-
ered earlier.


Case Study: Estimating Normalized Revenue
Exhibit 33 contains 10 years of historical revenue data and four years of estimated
normalized data for Continental AG, a global automotive supplier. The accompanying
bar chart in Exhibit 34 graphically depicts the data and includes a trend line based on
a linear regression of the data. The numerical values for each point along the trend line
can be found by using the TREND formula in Microsoft Excel. The TREND formula
uses observations on the dependent variable (in this case revenue) and observations
on the explanatory (time) variable to perform a linear regression by using least squares
criterion to find the best fit. After computing the best fit regression model, the TREND
formula returns predicted values associated with new points in time. The worksheet
for Exhibit 33 and Exhibit 34 in the downloadable Microsoft Excel workbook demon-
strates the calculations used in the exhibits.

                           The “growth relative to GDP growth” and “market growth and market share” methods
                           discussed earlier can also be applied to developing longer-term projections. Once a
                           revenue projection has been established, previously described methods of forecasting
                           costs can be used to complete the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow
                           statement.
                               If an analyst is creating a valuation model such as a DCF model, estimating a ter-
                           minal value is required to capture the going-concern value of the company after the
                           explicit forecast period. Certain considerations should be kept in mind when deriving
                           the terminal value based on long-term projections.
                               First, an analyst should consider whether the terminal year free cash flow projection
                           should be normalized before that cash flow is incorporated into a long-term projec-
                           tion. For example, if the explicitly forecasted terminal year free cash flow is “low” (e.g.,
                           because of business cycle reasons or capital investment projects), an adjustment to
                           normalize the amount might be warranted. Second, an analyst should consider whether
                           and how the future long-term growth rate will differ from the historical growth rate.
                           For example, even some mature companies might be able to accelerate their long-term
                           growth rate through product innovation and/or market expansion (e.g., Apple), whereas
                           other seemingly well-protected “growers” could experience an unanticipated decline
                           in their business as a result of technological change (e.g., Eastman Kodak Company,
                           a global commercial printing and imaging company).
                               One of the greatest challenges facing the analyst is anticipating inflection points,
                           when the future will look significantly different from the recent past. Most DCF
                           models rely on a perpetuity calculation, which assumes that the cash flows from the
                           last year of an explicit forecast grow at a constant rate forever. Because the perpetuity
                           can account for a relatively large portion of the overall valuation of the company, it
                           is critical that the cash flow used is representative of a “normalized” or “mid-cycle”
                           result. If the analyst is examining a cyclical company, using a boom year as the starting
                           point for the perpetuity could result in a grossly overstated valuation. Similarly, using
                           a trough year could result in a valuation that is much too low.
                               Another important consideration is economic disruption. The economy can
                           occasionally experience sudden, unprecedented changes that affect a wide variety of
                           companies, such as the 2008 global financial crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic. Even
                           a company with a sound strategy and solid operations can be thrown far off course
                           by a sudden economic disruption, particularly if the company has a high degree of
                           financial leverage.
The Forecast Horizon and Long-Term Forecasting                                           495


    Regulation and technology are also potential drivers of inflection points, and it
is important for the analyst to keep a close eye on both. Government actions can
have extreme, sudden, and unpredictable impacts on some businesses. Technological
advances can turn fast-growing innovators obsolete in a matter of months. Both reg-
ulation and technology affect some industries more than others. Utilities experience
intense regulation but might not see a significant technological change for decades.
Semiconductor manufacturers must constantly keep up with new technology but
experience relatively light regulation. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are heavily
exposed to both regulation and technological advances.
    Finally, long-term growth is a key input in the perpetuity calculation. Some com-
panies and industries can grow faster than the overall economy for long periods of
time, causing them to account for an increasing share of overall output. Examples
include some technology companies, such as Tencent, Amazon, and Google. Other
companies, such as those in the print media sector, are likely to grow slower than the
overall economy or even shrink over time. Using an unrealistic long-term growth rate
can put the analyst’s valuation far off the mark.

EXAMPLE 10

  Important Considerations When Making Assumptions

  1. Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS) operates in the highly cyclical global airline
     industry. Operating margins for 2011–2019 are shown in the following
     table and in the Example 10 worksheet in the downloadable Microsoft Excel
     workbook.
                                           ​




                 2011   2012    2013   2014      2015   2016    2017   2018   2019
    Operating
    margin       1.0%   10.8%   6.5%    5.6%     8.6%   −2.9%   9.0%   9.9%   7.9%
                                           ​




     On the basis of only the information in the table, which of the following
     operating margins would most likely be appropriate to use in a perpetuity
     calculation for Turkish Airlines to arrive at a reasonable intrinsic value
     estimate?
      A. 6.0 percent
      B. 9.0 percent
      C. 9.9 percent
     Solution:
     A is correct. Because the airline industry is cyclical, an estimate of “mid-cy-
     cle” or “normalized” operating margin is necessary to estimate a perpetuity
     value. The nine-year average operating margin was 6.3 percent.
  For each of the companies in the following problems, indicate which of the
  choices is least likely to cause a change in the company’s outlook.

  2. ABC Diesel (hypothetical company), a manufacturer of diesel-power trucks
      A. Consumers have started switching to trucks with electric engines,
         threatening ABC’s historic strength in diesel engine trucks.
      B. ABC Diesel has formed a partnership with Electrico (hypothetical), a
         company involved in research and innovation in electric engines.

                              C. Environmental regulations have been getting tighter in most regions,
                                 and consistent with prior experience, this need to make the engines
                                 less polluting is expected to continue over the next several years.
                             Solution:
                             C is correct. Although it is important that environmental regulations have
                             been getting stricter, this is consistent with past experience and so does not
                             represent a turning point.

                           3. Abbott Laboratories, a diversified manufacturer of health care products,
                              including medical devices
                              A. Management reiterates its long-standing approach to capital
                                 deployment.
                              B. A competitor has demonstrated favorable efficacy data on a medical
                                 device candidate that will compete with an important Abbott product.
                              C. It has become more difficult for medical device manufacturers to
                                 receive regulatory approval for new products because of heightened
                                 safety concerns.
                             Solution:
                             A is correct. Management is sticking with its historical approach to capital
                             deployment, so this does not represent a turning point.

                           4. Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, operator of nine airports in Mexico, espe-
                              cially in the tourist-heavy southeast
                              A. Global economic disruption has caused a sharp decline in interna-
                                 tional travel.
                              B. Regulators will allow the construction of a new airport by a competi-
                                 tor in Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste’s service territory.
                              C. A technological advance will allow airlines to save 5 percent on fuel
                                 costs, but it is not expected to meaningfully alter passenger volumes.
                                 Similar developments in the past have benefited airlines but not air-
                                 ports, whose price per passenger is regulated.
                             Solution:
                             C is correct. Although the technological advance is good for the airlines, it
                             will not have a meaningful effect on passenger volumes, which will likely
                             prevent the airports from sharing in that benefit. In contrast, both A and B
                             could have a significant impact on the long-run earnings power of Mexican
                             airports.

                           5. LinkedIn, operator of an online social network for professionals and part of
                              Microsoft Corporation, with limited investment needs and no debt
                              A. Facebook, another online social network, announces a plan to enhance
                                 its offerings in the professional category.
                              B. Regulators announce an investigation of LinkedIn’s privacy practices,
                                 which could result in significant changes to the service.
The Forecast Horizon and Long-Term Forecasting                                     497


      C. The US Federal Reserve has just increased interest rates. Although this
         will raise borrowing costs, the rate increase is not expected to have a
         negative impact on the economy.
     Solution:
     C is correct. Because LinkedIn carries no debt, it is unlikely that higher
     interest rates will cause a change in the company’s outlook.

   PRACTICE PROBLEMS


The following information relates to questions
1-7
    Nigel French, an analyst at Taurus Investment Management, is analyzing Arch-
    way Technologies, a manufacturer of luxury electronic auto equipment, at the
    request of his supervisor, Lukas Wright. French is asked to evaluate Archway’s
    profitability over the past five years relative to its two main competitors, which
    are located in different countries with significantly different tax structures.
    French begins by assessing Archway’s competitive position within the luxury
    electronic auto equipment industry using Porter’s five forces framework. A sum-
    mary of French’s industry analysis is presented in Exhibit 1.



  Exhibit 1: Analysis of Luxury Electronic Auto Equipment Industry Using
  Porter’s Five Forces Framework

Force                                  Factors to Consider

Threat of substitutes                  Customer switching costs are high
Rivalry                                Archway holds 60 percent of world market share;
                                       each of its two main competitors holds 15 percent
Bargaining power of suppliers          Primary inputs are considered basic commodities,
                                       and there are a large number of suppliers
Bargaining power of buyers             Luxury electronic auto equipment is very specialized
                                       (non-standardized)
Threat of new entrants                 High fixed costs to enter industry

    French notes that for the year just ended (2019), Archway’s COGS was 30 percent
    of sales. To forecast Archway’s income statement for 2020, French assumes that
    all companies in the industry will experience an inflation rate of 8 percent on the
    COGS. Exhibit 2 shows French’s forecasts relating to Archway’s price and volume
    changes.



            Exhibit 2: Archway’s 2020 Forecasted Price and Volume
            Changes

          Average price increase per unit                        5.00%
          Volume growth                                         –3.00%

    After putting together income statement projections for Archway, French
    forecasts Archway’s balance sheet items. He uses Archway’s historical efficiency
    ratios to forecast the company’s working capital accounts.
    Based on his financial forecast for Archway, French estimates a terminal value
    using a valuation multiple based on the company’s average price-to-earnings
    multiple (P/E) over the past five years. Wright discusses with French how the ter-
    minal value estimate is sensitive to key assumptions about the company’s future

                              prospects. Wright asks French:
                              “What change in the calculation of the terminal value would you make if a tech-
                              nological development that would adversely affect Archway was forecast to occur
                              sometime beyond your financial forecast horizon?”

                           1. Which profitability metric should French use to assess Archway’s five-year his-
                              toric performance relative to its competitors?
                              A. Current ratio

                              B. Operating margin

                              C. Return on invested capital

                           2. Based on the current competitive landscape presented in Exhibit 1, French
                              should conclude that Archway’s ability to:
                              A. pass along price increases is high.

                              B. demand lower input prices from suppliers is low.

                              C. generate above-average returns on invested capital is low.

                           3. Based on the current competitive landscape presented in Exhibit 1, Archway’s
                              operating profit margins over the forecast horizon are least likely to:
                              A. decrease.

                              B. remain constant.

                              C. increase.

                           4. Based on Exhibit 2, Archway’s forecasted gross profit margin for 2020 is closest
                              to:
                              A. 62.7 percent.

                              B. 67.0 percent.

                              C. 69.1 percent.

                           5. French’s approach to forecasting Archway’s working capital accounts would be
                              most likely classified as a:
                              A. hybrid approach.

                              B. top-down approach.

                              C. bottom-up approach.

                           6. The most appropriate response to Wright’s question about the technological
                              development is to:
                              A. increase the required return.

                              B. decrease the perpetual growth rate.

                              C. decrease the price-to-earnings multiple.

                           7. If the luxury electronic auto equipment industry is subject to rapid technological
                              changes and market share shifts, how should French best adapt his approach to

The following information relates to questions
8-14
   Gertrude Fromm is a transportation sector analyst at Tucana Investments. She is
   conducting an analysis of Omikroon, N.V., a hypothetical European engineering
   company that manufactures and sells scooters and commercial trucks.
   Omikroon’s petrol scooter division is the market leader in its sector and has
   two competitors. Omikroon’s petrol scooters have a strong brand name and a
   well-established distribution network. Given the strong branding established by
   the market leaders, the cost of entering the industry is high. But Fromm antici-
   pates that small, inexpensive, imported petrol-fueled motorcycles could become
   substitutes for Omikroon’s petrol scooters.
   Fromm uses ROIC as the metric to assess Omikroon’s performance.
   Omikroon has just introduced the first electric scooter to the market at year-end
   2019. The company’s expectations are as follows:
   ■   Competing electric scooters will reach the market in 2021.
   ■   Electric scooters will not be a substitute for petrol scooters.
   ■   The important research costs in 2020 and 2021 will lead to more efficient
       electric scooters.
   Fromm decides to use a five-year forecast horizon for Omikroon after consider-
   ing the following three factors:

    Factor 1   The annual portfolio turnover at Tucana Investments is 30 percent.

    Factor 2   The electronic scooter industry is expected to grow rapidly over the
               next 10 years.

    Factor 3   Omikroon has announced it would acquire a light truck manufac-
               turer that will be fully integrated into its truck division by 2021 and
               will add 2 percent to the company’s total revenues.
   Fromm uses the base case forecast for 2020 shown in Exhibit 1 to perform the
   following sensitivity analysis:
   ■   The price of an imported specialty metal used for engine parts increases by
       20 percent.
   ■   This metal constitutes 4 percent of Omikroon’s cost of sales.
   ■   Omikroon will not be able to pass on the higher metal expense to its
       customers.

                               Omikroon will initially outsource its electric scooter parts. But manufacturing
                               these parts in-house beginning in 2021 will imply changes to an existing factory.
                               This factory cost EUR7 million three years ago and had an estimated useful life of
                               10 years. Fromm is evaluating two scenarios:

                                   Scenario 1   Refit the existing factory for EUR27 million.

                                   Scenario 2   Sell the existing factory for EUR5 million. Build a new factory
                                                costing EUR30 million with a useful life of 10 years.

                           8. Using Porter’s five forces analysis, which of the following competitive factors
                              is most likely to have the greatest impact on Omikroon’s petrol scooter pricing
                              power?
                               A. Rivalry

                               B. Threat of substitutes

                               C. Threat of new entrants

                           9. The metric used by Fromm to assess Omikroon’s performance incorporates:
                               A. the degree of financial leverage.

                               B. operating liabilities relative to operating assets.

                               C. the firm’s competitiveness relative to companies in other tax regimes.

                           10. Based on Omikroon’s expectations, the gross profit margin of Omikroon’s electric
                               scooter division in 2021 is most likely to be affected by:
                               A. competition.

                               B. research costs.

                              SOLUTIONS
                           1. B is correct. Operating (EBIT) margin is a pre-tax profitability measure that can
                              be useful in the peer comparison of companies in countries with different tax
                              structures. Archway’s two main competitors are located in different countries
                              with significantly different tax structures; therefore, a pre-tax measure is better
                              than an after-tax measure, such as ROIC. The current ratio is a liquidity measure,
                              not a profitability measure.

                           2. A is correct. Porter’s five forces framework in Exhibit 1 describes an industry
                              with high barriers to entry, high customer switching costs (suggesting a low
                              threat of substitutes), and a specialized product (suggesting low bargaining power
                              of buyers). Furthermore, the primary production inputs from the large group of
                              suppliers are considered basic commodities (suggesting low bargaining power
                              of suppliers). These favorable industry characteristics will likely enable Archway
                              to pass along price increases and generate above-average returns on invested
                              capital.

                           3. A is correct. The current favorable characteristics of the industry (high barriers
                              to entry, low bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, low threat of substitutes),
                              coupled with Archway’s dominant market share position, will likely lead to Arch-
                              way’s profit margins being at least equal to or greater than current levels over the
                              forecast horizon.

                           4. C is correct. The calculation of Archway’s gross profit margin for 2020, which
                              reflects the industry-wide 8% inflation on COGS, is calculated as follows:

                                    Revenue growth                                        1.85%
                                    COGS increase                                         4.76%


                                    Forecasted revenue (Base revenue = 100)               101.85
                                    Forecasted COGS (Base COGS = 30)                      31.43
                                    Forecasted gross profit                               70.42
                                    Forecasted gross profit margin                       69.14%


                              Revenue growth = (1 + Price increase for revenue) × (1 + Volume growth) – 1

                              = (1.05) × (0.97) – 1

                              = 1.85%.

                              COGS increase = (1 + Price increase for COGS) × (1 + Volume growth) – 1

                              = (1.08) × (0.97) – 1

                              = 4.76%.

                              Forecasted revenue = Base revenue × Revenue growth increase

                              = 100 × 1.0185

                              = 101.85.

                              Forecasted COGS = Base COGS × COGS increase
Solutions                                                                                   507


   = 30 × 1.0476

   = 31.43.

   Forecasted gross profit = Forecasted revenue – Forecasted COGS

   = 101.85 – 31.43

   = 70.42.

   Forecasted gross profit margin = Forecasted gross profit/Forecasted revenue

   = 70.42/101.85

   = 69.14%.

5. C is correct. French is using a bottom-up approach to forecast Archway’s work-
   ing capital accounts by using the company’s historical efficiency ratios to project
   future performance.

6. C is correct. If the future growth or profitability of a company is likely to be lower
   than the historical average (in this case, because of a potential technological
   development), then the target multiple should reflect a discount to the historical
   multiple to reflect this difference in growth and/or profitability. If a multiple is
   used to derive the terminal value of a company, the choice of the multiple should
   be consistent with the long-run expectations for growth and required return.
   French tells Wright he believes that such a technological development could have
   an adverse impact on Archway beyond the forecast horizon.

7. B is correct. Forecasting a single scenario would not be appropriate given the
   high degree of uncertainty and range of potential outcomes for companies in this
   industry.

8. B is correct. Small, inexpensive, imported petrol-fueled motorcycles are substi-
   tutes for petrol scooters and could increasingly have an impact on Omikroon’s
   petrol scoter pricing power.

9. B is correct. Return on invested capital is net operating profit minus adjusted
   taxes divided by invested capital, where invested capital is defined as operating
   assets minus operating liabilities.

10. A is correct. Competition from other electric scooter manufacturers is expected
    to begin in one year. After this time, competing electric scooters could lead to
    lower demand for Omikroon’s electric scooters and affect Omikroon’s gross profit
    margin.

11. B is correct. The electric scooter market is expected to grow rapidly, so the
    contribution of Omikroon’s new electric scooter division is forecast to expand
    significantly over the next 10 years. A is incorrect because the investment compa-
    ny’s portfolio turnover is not relevant for forecasting Omrikoon’s future results.
    C is incorrect because the light truck division is expected to add only 2% to total
    revenues in the future.

12. A is correct. The sensitivity analysis consists of an increase of 20 percent in the
    price of an input that constitutes 4 percent of cost of sales. Change in gross profit
    margin because of that increase is calculated as the change in cost of sales be-
    cause of price increase divided by sales:

                              = (Cost of sales × 0.04 × 0.2)/Sales

                              = (105.38 × 0.04 × 0.2)/152.38

                              = 0.0055 or 0.55%

                           13. C is correct. In Scenario 1, growth capital expenditures of EUR27 million for the
                               refit of the existing idle factory is higher than the growth capital expenditures in
                               Scenario 2 of EUR25 million. The EUR25 million is the cost of building a new fac-
                               tory for EUR30 million less the proceeds from the sale of the existing idle factory
                               of EUR5 million.

                           14. A is correct. The management of Omikroon and investor relations of ZeroWheel
                               are almost certainly biased in favor of expecting strong growth for the markets
                               they participate in. To evaluate the forecast, Fromm should seek more indepen-
                               dent sources and balance the biased sources with sources biased in the opposite
                               direction or an analyst who is more skeptical.

                           15. C is correct. Economies of scale are a situation in which average costs decrease
                               with increasing sales volume. Chrome’s gross margins have been increasing with
                               net sales. Gross margins that increase with sales levels provide evidence of econ-
                               omies of scale, assuming that higher levels of sales reflect increased unit sales.
                               Gross margin more directly reflects the cost of sales than does profit margin.

                           16. A is correct. A bottom-up approach for developing inputs to equity valuation
                               models begins at the level of the individual company or a unit within the com-
                               pany. By modeling net sales using the average annual growth rate, Candidate A
                               is using a bottom-up approach. B and C are incorrect because both Candidate B
                               and Candidate C are using a top-down approach, which begins at the level of the
                               overall economy.

                           17. B is correct. A top-down approach usually begins at the level of the overall
                               economy. Candidate B assumes industry sales will grow at the same rate as
                               nominal GDP but that Chrome will have a 2-percentage-point decline in market
                               share. A and C are incorrect because Candidate B is not using any elements of a
                               bottom-up approach; therefore, a hybrid approach is not being employed.

                           18. C is correct. Candidate C assumes that the 2020 gross margin will increase by 20
                               bps from 2019 and that net sales will grow at 50 bps slower than nominal GDP
                               (nominal GDP = Real GDP + Inflation = 1.6% + 2.0% = 3.6%). Accordingly, the
                               2020 forecasted cost of sales is USD19.27 million, rounded to USD19.3 million.

19. B is correct. Candidate A assumes that the 2020 SG&A/net sales will be the same
    as the average SG&A/net sales over the 2017–19 time period and that net sales
    will grow at the annual average growth rate in net sales over the 2017–19 time
    period. Accordingly, the 2020 forecasted SG&A expenses are USD25.5 million.

20. A is correct. In forecasting financing costs, such as interest expense, the debt/
    equity structure of a company is a key determinant. Accordingly, a method that
    recognizes the relationship between the income statement account (interest
    expense) and the balance sheet account (debt) would be a preferable method for
    forecasting interest expense when compared with methods that forecast based
    solely on the income statement account. By using the effective interest rate (inter-
    est expense divided by average gross debt), Candidate A is taking the debt/equity
    structure into account. B and C are incorrect because Candidate B (who forecasts
    2020 interest expense to be the same as 2019 interest expense) and Candidate
    C (who forecasts 2020 interest expense to be the same as the 2017–19 average
    interest expense) are not taking the balance sheet into consideration.

21. B is correct. Base rates refer to attributes of a reference class and base rate neglect
    is ignoring such class information in favor of specific information. By incorporat-
    ing industry data, Candidate B is seeking to mitigate this behavioral bias.
                                                                 G-1
